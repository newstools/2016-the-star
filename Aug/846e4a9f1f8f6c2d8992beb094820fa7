President Uhuru Kenyatta has underscored the need for African leaders to work together as part of their commitment to the Pan- African development agenda that is centred on a stable, peaceful and prosperous Africa.The President affirmed that Kenya will not waver in its commitment to strengthen friendship and unity bonds with its East African neighbours and Africa as a whole, saying Kenya&rsquo;s future extends beyond self reliance.&ldquo;It is with this unity that we will prosper and deliver on the promise of independence, liberation from our colonial past and a commitment to our Pan-Africa goal,&rdquo; he said. He added: &ldquo;It is a noble course worth our efforts, a good legacy for today&rsquo;s generation and a worthwhile investment for our future generations.&rdquo;The president also emphasised that his administration has and will always remain focused on regional trade and cooperation.He said Kenya will continue to strengthen ties through the free movement of people, goods and investments, including pressing for the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade and a continued growth towards ultimate integration.The Head of State spoke on Saturday at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre where he addressed TICAD&rsquo;s thematic session on &lsquo;Promoting Stability and Sustaining Peace through strong institutions&rsquo;. Other speakers at the high-level discussion segment were President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita of Mali, African Union Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and former Egypt Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab.Japan&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Minister Fumio Kishida was also in attendance.United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon delivered his message to TICAD through a video clip played during the session.President Kenyatta outlined Kenya&rsquo;s efforts to entrench equality within a progressive governance system that serves the interests of all citizens.He said peace and stability are crucial elements of a functional democracy as well as social and economic progress.&ldquo;Indeed, you cannot contemplate development in the midst of chaos and anarchy,&rdquo; he said.The head of state cited Kenya&rsquo;s Constitution as one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, which he noted had provided strong governance institutions.&ldquo;These were meant to not only entrench democracy but also to ensure sustained peace and stability,&rdquo; said the President.The President said the Constitution provided for the formation of independent commissions to directly deal with diverse issues and formulate new reforms for various sectors.These include the National Land Commission which was, among other things, established to investigate historical land injustices and recommend actions for redress.The National Cohesion and Integration Commission constituted to eliminate all forms of ethnic and racial discrimination, enhance tolerance, understanding and acceptance of diversity in all aspects of national life, and to safeguard the respect for religious, cultural and linguistic diversity in a plural society.Others are the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission established to directly address, prosecute corruption crimes and to confiscate wealth that was obtained corruptly.The President also cited the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission which is mandated to conduct, plan for and supervise elections as well as to delineate electoral boundaries.&ldquo;These are but just a few examples of institutions which are already contributing greatly to stability and peaceful coexistence in the country,&rdquo; said President Kenyatta.The President also cited Kenya&rsquo;s devolved system of governance which has enhanced public participation and minimized perceptions of marginalization.On his part, Mali&rsquo;s President Keita shared his country&rsquo;s journey to peace and stability. He expressed hope that TICAD will leverage efforts to boost security in his country and in the continent.Dr Dlamini-Zuma urged African countries to strive to promote peace and development, saying they are two sides of the same coin.&ldquo;When there is no peace, there is no development and when there is no development, there is no peace,&rdquo; the African Union Commission Chairperson said.Japan&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Minister Kishida assured of his country&rsquo;s support to Africa&rsquo;s socio-economic development.
