Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has said he was not isolated at a meeting to discuss Luhya unity hosted last weekend by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.The Cord co-principal says he was invited to attend the meeting, but could not make it.&ldquo;How do I get isolated by not going to a harambee? I was invited and I declined to go,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.The harambee had been organised to raise money for a school in Khwisero, with the leaders present later invited to discuss unity talks at Atwoli&rsquo;s rural home.&ldquo;[Former Lugari MP Cyrus] Jirongo was not there; [Senator Boni] Khalwale was not there; I was not there; and we believe that Francis Atwoli is trying to take our community to an auction ring and we will not allow him,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.He said he had arranged to attend other meetings in Western, and did not snub Atwoli.&ldquo;In fact on that Saturday I had structured meetings in Teso, in Bungoma and in Trans Nzoia, which I couldn&rsquo;t cancel,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.The Luhya unity talks are meant to rally the community to vote as a bloc and to support one leader from the region to run for President.Three politicians from the region have declared their interest in the presidency. They are Wetang&rsquo;ula, Jirongo and Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi.
