Hip hop artist Octopizzo recently released an epic video &nbsp;"Utanisho," which is a bold statement that he is at his best in his career.This video comes only a few weeks after he released "Butere," which swerves from Octopizzo's typical, hip hop style to show appreciation of the African culture.This time, Octopizzo delivers a clear message that he is the best in the rap game - the king.With much swagger and&nbsp;braggadocio, he hits hard at others rappers in the industry with his skillful,&nbsp;self-aggrandizing&nbsp;wordplay."Utanisho" is clear indication that the Kibera-born rapper is on the right direction and remains dedicated to developing his craft.He also acknowledges that it is through his lyricism that he has achieved great stardom, success and opportunities.The video, which might have a borrowed a similar concept as Russ's "What They Want," has a great production and direction.The video whose&nbsp;opening indicates that the video was shot in Geneva, Switerland by ItsNow Media,&nbsp; displays great editing with a brilliant colour effect and visual artistry. In this watered down era of rap, Octopizzo remains one of the few East African artists who are putting great effort in their work.Contrary to other Kenyan rappers, Octopizzo continues to exhibit consistency and growth with every release.&nbsp; 2016 continues to be an excellent year for the rapper, and certainly "Utanisho" is a hit.
