Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru is expected to announce her bid for Kirinyaga governor on Saturday, after months of consultation.Waiguru confirmed to the Star she will be seeking the Jubilee Party ticket in the race likely to complicate matters for the incumbent Joseph Ndathi and Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari, who also wants to run.&ldquo;Tomorrow [today], at 10am, I will be at TNA headquarters to pick my life member Jubilee certificate,&rdquo; Waiguru said. &ldquo;I will be with Kirinyaga TNA officials.&rdquo; She said on Saturday, she will address Kirinyaga people in Kerugoya town before formally announcing her bid.Saturday&rsquo;s meeting has been organised by businessmen fronting candidates for various seats in the county. About 1,000 people have been invited. Waiguru&rsquo;s posters are already circulating but those close to her said it is the work of those who want her to run.Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari, who has declared his candidature for the governor&rsquo;s seat, yesterday told the Star he is unperturbed by the entrance on Waiguru in the race. &ldquo;We will meet in the ballot during the primaries. Let her brace for a turf contest,&rdquo; Gitari said.Governor Joseph Ndathi will be seeking reelection on a Jubilee Party ticket. Also in the race to unseat Ndathi is businessman Muriithi Kagai, who contested in the last general election but lost. Though Gitari has not made his interest public, he has been accusing the governor of misusing public funds. He is also engaged in many development projects and spends most of his time in harambees and meeting the people. Ndathi, on the other hand, has accused Gitari of undermining his leadership.On November 21, 2015, Waiguru became the first CS in the Jubilee coalition to resign. She cited health concerns after she was mentioned in the Sh791 million National Youth Service scandal.She has said she blew the whistle by alerting the DCI over the suspect dealings at the NYS.
