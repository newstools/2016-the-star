Bura MP Ali Wario wants the Tana River government to account for Sh12 billion allocated by the national government in the past three financial years.&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t speak against corruption and looting of public resources then the message we are passing to our people is that we support corrupt regimes,&rdquo; he said. Wario spoke at a baraza at Adhele Primary School yesterday.
