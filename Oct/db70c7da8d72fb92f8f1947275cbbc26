Mandera Governor Ali Roba yesterday welcomed the curfew imposed by the state to prevent terrorism. &ldquo;I support any move by the government to improve security in Mandera,&rdquo; he told reporters. But Roba urged security personnel not to use the curfew to harass residents.&ldquo;It is my hope we will not start hearing cases of harassment and torture involving our security personnel. The people&rsquo;s lives should not be interrupted in any way,&rdquo; he said.Roba took issue with reports some landlords in Mandera town were chasing away non-local tenants, fearing their premises might be attacked. &ldquo;This borders on discrimination. We will not allow that to happen.
