Mandera Governor Ali Roba yesterday welcomed the curfew imposed by the state to prevent terrorism. I support any move by the government to improve security in Mandera, he told reporters. But Roba urged security personnel not to use the curfew to harass residents. It is my hope we will not start hearing cases of harassment and torture involving our security personnel. The people s lives should not be interrupted in any way, he said.Roba took issue with reports some landlords in Mandera town were chasing away non-local tenants, fearing their premises might be attacked. This borders on discrimination. We will not allow that to happen. Those found chasing away non-locals will face the law, he said.A lnotice dated October 27 and signed by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery says the curfew applies to Mandera, Omar Jillo, Arabia, Fino, Lafey, Kutulo and Elwak towns and the environs extending 20km from the Kenya-Somalia border.The government imposed a 6.30pm to 6.30am curfew following an al Shabaab attack at the Bishaaro Guest House on Tuesday.
