The feud between Kilifi Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto and county secretary Owen Baya has deepened.Last Friday, the two almost exchanged blows when Kamto confronted Baya in his office and demanded the keys to a government vehicle he has been using. Baya told the Star on Wednesday he tried to leave his office to avoid quarrelling with Kamto, but the deputy governor blocked the way. He closed the door and blocked anyone from entering. When officers heard the argument, they forced the door open. I managed to get out and rushed to my personal car. He came running after me and held the door of my car. I had to walk and a Good Samaritan carried me away in his car, he said.Kamto is said to have later deflated Baya s car tyres. He allegedly snatched the car keys of Baya s official car from the driver and drove off.Kamto has accused Baya of frustrating his efforts to serve residents. He said he enjoyed a good working relationship with the governor, until Baya was employed. Baya has no moral authority to take my official car. It s only the governor who can call me and give me directions, not any other officer, Kamto said. He is a very junior officer in the hierarchy of the county government. The spat started with reports Kamto wanted to unseat Governor Amason Kingi. He has denied he plans to run. It worsened after Kamto did not to take part in the ODM grassroots primaries, in which Kingi was elected county chairman.
