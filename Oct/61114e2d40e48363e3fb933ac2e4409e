Party leader Mutua Katuku said they will consider people with integrity, the youth, those from the marginalised groups and women. The former Mwala MP spoke in Kitale town on Sunday, when he opened the party&rsquo;s Trans Nzoia office.&ldquo;If a person is rich, but his wealth is questioned or linked to corruption, our party will not issue him a certificate,&rdquo; Katuku said. Secretary general Joseph Mathuku said, &ldquo;Money is not a priority.&rdquo; The party was launched on October 18. It has opened offices in 30 counties.The law requires that a political party at least opens offices in 24 counties. Katuku said the party intends to offer generational change in leadership and politics. He said the birth of PTP was informed by the need to expand Kenya&rsquo;s democratic space.
