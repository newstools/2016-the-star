Pupils are spending more time in class and are no longer playing truant since tablets were distributed in schools. This came up during the launch of the Digital Learning Programme at Jilore Primary School, Malindi constituency, on Friday. The programme, outlined in the Jubilee government manifesto, is implemented by the Information and Communication Technology Authority. Pupils are very excited and enthusiastic to learn. The programme is really motivating them, ICTA director Martha Dena said. By the end of October the tablets would have reached 4,000 schools out of the targeted 23,000, she said. Water PS Patrick Mwangi, who was the chief guest, said, Having participated in class, there is true learning, the programme is dynamic and versatile. Dena said 60,000 teachers have been trained for the programme. Schools have also been connected to the national power grid.
