President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to only elect leaders who will drive the country s unity, cohesion and prosperity.He said in the coming months ahead of the August general election, Kenyans will be treated to campaigns that can easily mislead the country. Next year, Kenya holds its second general election under the new Constitution. As we prepare to exercise our right to vote as we pick our leaders I ask Kenyans not to be deceived by the loud and ugly rhetoric we will hear in the months to come. In making your choices, focus on what our heroes wanted for Kenya: unity, cohesion, and prosperity, Uhuru said.This was part of the Mashujaa Day celebrations speech he delivered in Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos county, on Thursday.He urged leaders in all sectors, including the media, politics and business to guide the country in a manner that makes elections a worthy competition. Campaigns are a delicate period for any country. Kenyans rely on you to navigate this period successfully. As you pursue your own individual and collective aims, I trust that you will show the world that Kenyans can disagree politically, and yet remain a strong and united nation, Uhuru said.He said he is keen to face off with his opponents in campaigns driven by issues for the benefit of Kenyans.Uhuru is preparing to defend his seat in the August 8, 2017 elections alongside Deputy President William Ruto.The two recently launched their reelection vehicle - the Jubilee Party - and are expected to name its officials before the end of the month.The outfit is a merger of 12 parties, which dissolved on September 10.
