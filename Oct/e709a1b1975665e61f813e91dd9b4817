Moi University acting VC Laban Ayiro has promoted 19 senior managers at the institution. He said the promotions were based on merit and staff should support those appointed in the new positions. Most of those promoted will be principals and directors at the Moi University colleges and campuses across the country. Most of them will also discharge their duties in an acting capacity, pending confirmation. “The changes are aimed at improving all our programmes,” Ayiro said. Those promoted were introduced at a senate meeting in their new capacities. The changes were announced by Academics, Research and Extension deputy vice chancellor Isaac Kimengi. Prof Ayiro was appointed on September 19, to take over from Prof Richard Mibey, whose tenure ended. His appointment was rejected by some politicians in the North Rift led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago.
