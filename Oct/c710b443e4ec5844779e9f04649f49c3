Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter (pictured) yesterday said he is confident of being re-elected and warned those eyeing his position against quitting their jobs. He said his rivals have no chance of unseating him because he has performed well.&ldquo;The people of Nandi will give me a second term,&rdquo; Keter said. Last Sunday, Keter hosted DP Ruto in his constituency, signalling improved relations between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run on the JP ticket,&rdquo; he said.
