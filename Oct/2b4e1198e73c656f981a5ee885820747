Governors should serve for two terms to ensure the stability and success of devolution, Busia s Sospeter Ojaamong has said.He said governors deserve a second term to fully implement their projects. The governor spoke in Kisumu town on Thursday, when Meru Governor Peter Munya presented the devolution torch to Kisumu s Jack Ranguma.Ojaamong said the counties have made significant gains under the leadership of incumbent governors, despite many challenges caused by the national government . As the pioneer governors of devolution, we took three years to put in place structures for the effective implementation of projects, he said.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya and Ranguma supported the call by Ojaamong.Munya said, We made pledges to the electorate, and we need time to implement them. The new leaders are likely to initiate their own projects instead of completing those already underway. This will hurt development. Ranguma said, It is only fair to reelect us so we complete our projects. Ojaamong said devolution has transformed the counties and brought services closer to the people.He accused the national government of frustrating devolution by failing to release funds on time.Ojaamong cited health, roads and agriculture as some of the devolved functions that are starved . The national government does little for citizens and therefore it is prudent for the counties to receive a huge chunk of allocations, he said.Ojaamong said health is not fully devolved, and the counties lack control over medics. Munya said devolution is working and people at the grassroots are able to access services more easily. Guard devolution jealously , he said.
