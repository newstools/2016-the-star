Sunday&rsquo;s National Motocross Championship Six should be a spectacularly extreme affair with local riders renewing their rivalry at Jamhuri Park.Notable absentees will be Kawasaki&rsquo;s Shivam Vinayak who is still nursing an arm injury, Apollo Mbuki who went back to his Chicago base and Ivan Guya back at Brunel University in London to resume his sophomore studies.Guya and Apollo starred for Kenya during the FIM Africa Motocross of Nations at Jamhuri last month and will no doubt be missed by spectators.Apollo is seeking to make his debut in the American national motocross series and move on to ride professionally in the United States.Shivam who will be at Jamhuri as a spectator hopes to resume training in three weeks time.&ldquo;I will be back in three weeks so I will definitely skip this weekend&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; said Shivam.In the absence of the MX1 trio, MX2 Class rider Ngugi Waweru will definitely be the star attraction in the scheduled combined heat runs which will merge MX1, MX2 and MX225 classes on the day.Organisers East African Motor Sports Club will combine the three classes ostensibly to offer spectators pure adrenaline action on corners and jumps.&ldquo;There will be continuous racing after the early morning practice lap. This should be a great weekend treat for spectators considering the riders&rsquo; preparedness,&rdquo; EASMC chairman Chris Wahome said.MX50 class will feature the likes of Kit Garner, Andrew Ohondo and A. Renzige. MX65&rsquo;s usual suspects are the Takkunnen siblings Jet and Jaiden. MX85 has the likes of Maina Wanjigi, Kigen Kiplagat and Christian Chege.MX125 will see Rolf Kihara renew his rivalry will Ethan Nyachae and John Schrier. MX2 leader Ngugi Waweru will take on Orobia Malumgu and Andre Antoine.
