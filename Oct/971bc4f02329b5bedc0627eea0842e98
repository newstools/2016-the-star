Baba Dogo residents have petitioned the county assembly to repossess three acres they say are irregularly owned by private developers. In the petition, the residents say the land is still owned by Unicom Investments Ltd, despite its lease having expired 16 years ago. They say Unicom Investments Ltd has not renewed the lease and has transferred the land to another developer, Avi Marketing Investment Ltd. We pray that the county assembly intervene and ensure that the land is reverted to the county government and used for development of public utilities, which are so much needed in the ward, they say. The residents say the companies have not developed the land and waste is dumped on it, posing a health hazard. In August 2006, City Hall declined to approve the construction of a godown on the plot, citing anomalies in the ownership documents.
