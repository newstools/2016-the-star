West Pokot leaders have said the county and national governments have used a lot of resources to promote peace in the North Rift. Governor Simon Kachapin and Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto addressed residents during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Makutano Primary School. &ldquo;We will not accept a few leaders to disrupt peace because of their own selfish interests,&rdquo; Kachapin said. He said the county is not ready to witness bloodshed after warring communities decided to live harmoniously. Kachapin accused some leaders of planning to cause chaos by &ldquo;inciting a certain community for political gain&rdquo;. &ldquo;Gone are the days when leaders used to incite to get political mileage. We can&rsquo;t expose our communities to risks because of votes and kingpin-ship,&rdquo; he said. The governor said most North Rift counties are marginalised and it is high time leaders showed residents the right path to development.
