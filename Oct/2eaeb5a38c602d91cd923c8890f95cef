West Pokot leaders have said the county and national governments have used a lot of resources to promote peace in the North Rift. Governor Simon Kachapin and Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto addressed residents during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Makutano Primary School. We will not accept a few leaders to disrupt peace because of their own selfish interests, Kachapin said. He said the county is not ready to witness bloodshed after warring communities decided to live harmoniously. Kachapin accused some leaders of planning to cause chaos by inciting a certain community for political gain . Gone are the days when leaders used to incite to get political mileage. We can t expose our communities to risks because of votes and kingpin-ship, he said. The governor said most North Rift counties are marginalised and it is high time leaders showed residents the right path to development.
