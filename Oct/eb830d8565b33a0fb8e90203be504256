ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi cannot be trusted to join Cord because "he is being used by the Jubilee Party to cause divisions", a nominated MP has said.Ford Kenya MP Patrick Wangamati yesterday said, How can you join our house and start dictating to us that you want to be the Cord presidential candidate? That is outrageous and beats logic. If you want to join us, wait for direction. He said Musalia "has never been a serious person". Wangamati said Musalia should not expect to be Cord s flag bearer because "the coalition has three candidates who have fought tooth and nail to ensure the party is strong and cannot allow an outsider to join with outrageous demands." Mudavadi is being used by Jubilee to cause cracks in Cord. This will eventually lead to divisions within the coalition. He is a Jubilee mole and cannot be trusted, he said.Wangamati, a Luhya elder, urged Cord leaders to investigate Mudavadi "thoroughly" before allowing him to join the party.But ODM Sirisia MP hopeful Moses Nandalwe warned Wangamati against "speaking on your master s behalf". He is old enough to speak sense, but on this matter he has failed elders of his age. He should understand that Western region stands to benefit if Mudavadi joins Cord. It will enable us to unseat Jubilee from power, he said.Nandalwe, popularly known as Mr Money bags, said Wangamati s sentiments were in bad taste and go against Cord s manifesto.
