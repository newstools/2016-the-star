Busia Finance executive Leonard Wanda Obimbira has declared he will run for Budalang i MP. I m today announcing my intention to go for the Budalang i Parliamentary seat on the ODM ticket, he said on Wednesday in Bunyala West. I want the constituents to get the message loud and clear. Obimbira said he has wants to unseat incumbent Ababu Namwamba so he can improve the socioeconomic development of Bunyala subcounty.He said Namwamba has done little to change the lives of residents, hence, does not deserve another term. He said the residents voice must be respected and because they are in ODM, their representative must also be from ODM. The MP has deserted the people of Budalang i by jumping ship to the Labour Party of Kenya, thus leaving a gap in the most popular party, ODM, he said. ODM must have a candidate. That candidate must be me. There is no secret I ll win the party ticket during its primaries and eventually win election. Obimbira said he has wants to reverse rising poverty. I ll be in the forefront to fight for the rights of fishermen, he said. I ll come up with bills, which, once passed, will protect them against constant harassment by the Ugandan authorities. Other hopefuls who seeking the ODM ticket are Andrew Nakitare, Albert Gumo, Constantine Obuya, Deogratias Adundo and Odhiambo Bara.
