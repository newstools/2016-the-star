The Nyandarua government will offer free and compulsory nursery education if Governor Daniel Waithaka signs the Early Childhood Development and Education Bill.The bill was moved by Ol Kalou MCA Kamau Ngotho on Tuesday. It states that the power to impose school fees is vested in the Education executive and the County Education Board.The bill says no child should be denied education because of failure to pay fees. It bans admission fees. The bill prescribes a Sh100,000 fine or a jail term not exceeding six months for parents who do not take their children to school.It prohibits holiday tuition and torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Ngotho said it is the responsibility of the head teacher of an ECDE centre to ensure pupils attend school.He will write to parents demanding an explanation if a child misses school for five consecutive days. If the teacher finds that there are no reasonable grounds for absence, he or she shall write again requiring them to submit a report on the child to the Subcounty Early Childhood Development officer, the bill says.It provides that no public ECDE centre shall be converted into a private institution. For a private ECDE institution to be converted into a public facility, there will be consultation between the County Education Board and approval from the Education executive.The centres will be managed by pre-primary management committees that shall consist of three parents, the head teacher, who shall be secretary, and a county government representative.
