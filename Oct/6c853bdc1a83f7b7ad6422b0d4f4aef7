Tana River Governor Hussein Dado on Wednesday launched a Sh160 million relief food programme for drought victims.The food includes rice, beans and cooking oil for 97,000 families. The food stored in Hola will be supplied first to worst-hit areas.Dado flagged off the second batch of the relief food. He said a convoy of trucks filled with food has already been sent to Wayu.Dado said due to the extreme drought, the county spends Sh3 million daily to supply water in four wards where boreholes and water pans have dried up.He said the food included 12,500 50kg bags of rice, 8,050 50kg bags of beans and 150,000 litres of cooking oil.&ldquo;We have begun emergency intervention to supply relief food in a county initiative. It aims to prevent more loss of life,&rsquo;&rsquo; Dado said.He said two people died while they attempted to fetch water for their animals. He said the county wants to prevent more loss of life from lack of food and water.&ldquo;Tana River is one of the counties adversely affected by drought. We last experienced such a disaster in 1984,&rsquo;&rsquo; Dado said. He said water supply is a major problem in 154 villages.At the storehouse, there was a beehive of activity as trucks lined up to load food for delivery to victims. A fleet of trucks flagged off was headed to Asa, one of the most remote and worst-hit parts of the county. It is more than 300 kilometres from Hola.Dado dismissed critics, who have been accusing the county of failing to take action, saying they do not know what is going on. &ldquo;They are in air-conditioned offices in Nairobi and are not in touch with the reality,&rdquo; he said.
