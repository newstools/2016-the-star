A company associated with Africa s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has sparked controversy among landowners in Kajiado county after it allegedly picked individuals to represent Mailua farmers in mining deals.Dangote seeks to mine limestone and marble in Kajiado as he prepares to open a cement plant in Kenya. Dangote Quarries Kenya applied for an exclusive prospecting license for limestone and marble in land measuring about 120 square kilometres and it was approved by the government.The billionaire announced plans to set up a Sh34 billion cement factory in Kenya in 2013 and has been prospecting in the limestone-rich Kitui and Kajiado counties.Yesterday, two representatives of the 217-member Mailua Group Ranch said they have not taken lightly the decision by the company to engage an individual farmer and two county administration officers.Tarayia ole Mantina and Uhuru ole Nchoke, whose farms have been marked for limestone prospects by Dangote, said they appointed six individuals to engage the company in the mining deals, but they cannot trust the three individuals picked by the company.Mantina said Paul Matampash and two chiefs, who have no property in Mailua, have imposed themselves as spokesmen without their authority. Each of the 217 members have more than 140 acres on the hilly parts earmarked for prospects. We picked six people to represent us in the deals, he said.But Engineer John Walter from the office of the commissioner of mines yesterday said the company had settled on Matampash to represent the farmers as a community liaison officer, instead of engaging with many people. Matampash, as far as the government knows, is the liaison officer. We re not aware of the said friction in Mailua, Walter said. But Matampash said he has not been confirmed, as mining has not started.
