President Uhuru Kenyatta has come under more criticism remarks that appeared to suggest he has lost hope the war against corruption.Uhuru said he was frustrated and placed the blame on authorities and personalities including Auditor General Edward Ouko.But Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire said Kenyans should hold the President directly responsible for the rampant graft that is wrecking the country.He was of the view that Uhuru went too far and compared him to a major who whines and complains before soldiers."In the military, when the general retreats and surrenders, soldiers get demoralised and he is shot dead," he said."In a civil democracy, we don't shoot generals, we fire them. Kenyans should vote out the desperate Jubilee regime which has lost control of the country."Bosire, who is ODM treasurer, further said on Friday that the President's admission was "desperate, unfortunate and reckless"."None other than the president himself vowed that he will fight corruption and instill transparency and openness in governance," he said. "He pledged in the Jubilee manifesto that corruption will be a thing of the past."The MP also told the Star by phone that it was unfortunate that the country has a commander-in-chief who cannot fulfill his promises."This was confirmation that the President has lost control in the management of the affairs of the country, and a demonstration of lack of goodwill to slay the dragon of corruption," said Bosire.Read: Take responsibility on corruption matters, Raila tells UhuruAlso read: LSK pledges to support Chief Justice Maraga in war against corruptionBut at the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos, Uhuru asked chief justice David Maraga to tackle corruption by expediting court processes.He said, hile releasing 7,000 petty offenders, that the space can now be filled by the "big fishes" in government who will be found guilty of corruption.Read: Kenya needs to see a 'big fish' convicted of corruption - EACC boss
