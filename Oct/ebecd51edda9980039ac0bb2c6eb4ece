The country is being looted, and it is time to act, he said.Khalifa said the sky has closed and there are no rains because of immorality and corruption. The organising secretary said about 1.3 million Kenyans face starvation.He said lives had been lost and many will perish if people will not change their ways.Kilifi, Kwale and Tana River are some of the Coast counties that have been hit by hunger.Khalifa said Thursday will be a day of repentance and forgiveness as it is the only sure way to restore the country s glory. This will be our day to reflect and seek forgiveness. A day when we shall pray for change, the runaway corruption, attacks and all evil things that happen because some of us have not been praying, he said.Khalifa said there is an upsurge in incidents of rape and molestation, and indication that moral values are degrading.The organising secretary said leaders have found corruption a regular thing and they will lead the country to the dogs if urgent action is not taken. He said terror attacks have claimed lives and only through prayers will they subside.
