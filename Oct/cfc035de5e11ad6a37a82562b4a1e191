Anyone who wants to run on a Wiper ticket will be rejected if they engage in hooliganism, abuse and hate speech.Hopefuls have been told to behave or forget running as a Wiper candidate.Party chairman David Musila on Thursday said supporters of former Public Works PS Gedion Mulyungi and those of former LSK chairman Erick Mutua clashed in Nguni, Mwingi Central, on Friday last week. They fought when they accidentally met in Nguni.Both Mulyungi and Mutua are seeking the Wiper ticket to unseat Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu. The MP has ditched Wiper for Jubilee. The duo have been aggressively promoting themselves in the constituency. But Musila told the Star on the phone the Code of Conduct for Wiper leaves no room for uncouth behaviour among aspirants and members. The Code of Conduct bars members from engaging in violence, insults or abuse lest they be eliminated from contesting, Musila said. He said in the history of Mwingi politics, violence has been unheard of and it will never be condoned. Aspirants should follow the example of party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and myself. We have never encouraged violence during our campaigns, Musila said. Before the March 4, 2013, general election, Kalonzo was the Mwingi North MP, while Musila was the Mwingi South MP. Musila said during their days as MPs, they encouraged peaceful campaigning among supporters. I want to advise the two young and upcoming politicians that violence, abuse and insults would not earn them victory, Musila said.Meanwhile, a Mwingi-based cleric has urged aspirants to stop violent campaigns. AIC regional chairman Rev Daniel Maithya said lthat lately they have been attacking each other and it greatly concerns residents. He called for prayers for peace.
