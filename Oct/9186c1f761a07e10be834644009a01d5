KenGen will keep thermal generators for use in times of emergency, chief executive Albert Mugo said yesterday.The 1,623MW- capacity company cut thermal sales by 24.74 per cent to 435 GigaWatt hours a measure of (a billion watts) units which is used by large power producers during the financial year ended June 30.This was due to rising capacity of geothermal and hydro power sources. We can't put them away because what will happen if we have a big drought like we had in 2000 and hydro reduced by about 50 per cent? So, thermals will be there as and when needed during those times of emergencies like drought or maintenance in geothermal plant.
