Another row is brewing between the National Land Commission and the Lamu government over compensation for Kwasasi land earmarked for a coal-fired power plant.The $2 billion (Sh200 billion) plant to be built by the Amu Power Company consortium will generate 1,050MW. It will be built by a Chinese company bringing 1,400 workers..About 975 acres are identified for the controversial project opposed by environmentalists and many residents.Early last week, National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri released a list of 675 landowners, who are to be compensated.The commission will pay each landowner Sh800,000 per acre.But on Tuesday, Lamu Governor Issa Timamy said most landowners say Sh800,000 is not enough.He said he stands with his people, who want more money, until then the land remains with the owners. &ldquo;The same landowners NLC claims are satisfied with Sh800,000 per acre are flocking to my office, asking me to intervene and raise the amount. They feel it&rsquo;s too little, I agree,&rdquo; Timamy said.He accused Swazuri of trying to &ldquo;play smart&rdquo; with the county leaders and failing to consult or involve them.Contacted for comment, Swazuri said the commission has done its due diligence. He said every law and regulation has been followed in formulatingthe compensation.He accused Timamy of frustrating commission efforts to resolve land issues.&ldquo;The governor is a committee member of the board concerned with the coal project. We met in Nairobi with him and other officials and agreed a physical planner would help establish the worth of the land,&rdquo; Swazuri said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why he complains and frustrates everything the commission does in Lamu.&rdquo;
