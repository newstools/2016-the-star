Sporptesa Premier League title favourites Tusker are the first Kenyan club to comply with the ongoing club licensing process.The brewers were feted by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Club Licensing Committee chairperson Professor Edwin Wamukoya at the federation s offices in Nairobi. Before Licensing Tusker, we looked at various aspects of club licensing as fronted by Fifa and as a committee came to the conclusion that the club had met the threshold, said Professor Wamukoya. I want to congratulate Tusker for achieving this milestone and hope that other clubs will follow suit, added the professor.FKF CEO Robert Muthomi reiterated the federation s commitment in ensuring that clubs comply with the licensing process saying: FKF remains committed to ensuring that all clubs in the Premier League and the National Super League comply with the club licensing requirements as stipulated by Fifa and Caf. We are happy that Tusker, who stand a good chance in representing the country in Caf organised competitions next year have complied and it is our prayer that the rest of the clubs that are likely to do the same will also take the necessary steps to comply, added Muthomi.The main objective of the process is to strengthen and professionalize the way football clubs are run as envisaged by the world governing body and Caf. According to Caf, all clubs participating in next year s continental tournaments have until October 31, 2016 to comply, failure to which they risk forfeiting their slot in the tournaments.
