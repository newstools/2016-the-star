The Kenya Revenue Authority is set to partner with the 47 counties in developing system for revenue collections, particularly from property rates.Commissioner for domestic taxes Benson Korongo said the taxman has started incorporating its electronic tax filing system, iTax, in the counties in a collaborative process.This is expected to increase income, and enable generation of billing slips through the system. &ldquo;Once fully implemented, other than boosting revenue collection for the counties, taxpayers will not be expected to visit county revenue offices for billing slips or to make payments for property rates,&rdquo; Korongo said.&ldquo;They will be able to carry out this task from their place of comfort using iTax system.&rdquo; The Commission on Revenue Allocation chairman Micah Cheserem said the KRA's mandate should go beyond the national government to the counties.&ldquo;It is noteworthy that the KRA has assisted by developing a model which has been adopted by some counties in order to harmonise revenue collection through the formation of regional blocks which have uniform legislation,&rdquo; Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said.
