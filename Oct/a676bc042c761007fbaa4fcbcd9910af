Bura MP Ali Wario wants the government to speed up distribution of relief food to residents in drought-stricken areas.On Tuesday, he oversaw the distribution of Sh100 million CDF-funded relief food in Wolensorea and Hosingo. Wario urged the Special Programmes ministry to stop issuing press statements in Nairobi, and, instead, focus on resolving the problem. We saw CS Mwangi Kiunjuri issue a press statement in Nairobi with regard to the current drought and the measures the government has put in place to mitigate it. One week later, there is nothing on the ground, he said.According to the Kenya Red Cross records, about 100,000 Kenyans have been adversely affected by the six-month drought. Wario said it is the government s prerogative to ensure no citizen goes to bed hungry. The situation is dire. Many livestock have died due to dwindling pasture and water. If nothing is done urgently, we could lose lives, he said. Wario said the western parts of Bura, which are far away from the River Tana, are the worst-hit, as water pans and dams have dried up.He said more than 30,000 residents need relief food and safe drinking water. Wario urged the county government, NGOs and other aid agencies to move in and assist the victims.Wolensorea assistant chief urged the government to stock drugs at health centres to end cases of diarrhoea, which are on the rise because many people use contaminated water.
