More than 30,000 residents are hungry due to prolonged drought, yet the Lamu county government has set aside Sh34.9 million for tea and mandazi.Of that amount, Sh8.9 million will pay for tea at Governor Issa Timamy&rsquo;s office. Residents are shocked at the allocations, saying the money should have been put to good use.Some said the money should have been channeled to the Health department. Many dispensaries and hospitals are in a deplorable state. Resident Ali Godana said, &ldquo;We should improve dispensaries like those that were vandalised by terrorists in Lamu East. Many hospitals don&rsquo;t have medicine.&rdquo;Others say part of the money could have been spent on dialysis for kidney patients, who mustseek medical services in Mombasa and Nairobi. Resident Ali Musadiffa said, &ldquo;How expensive can tea and mandazi get?&rdquo;
