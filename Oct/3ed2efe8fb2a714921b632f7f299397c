A few of Donald Trump's jokes had trouble landing at the Alfred E Smith Foundation Dinner on Thursday night.At the New York event Trump said of Hillary Clinton, "Here she is, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics," citing WikiLeaks revelations. This drew the loudest boos from the mostly Catholic audience.The event was a fundraiser for Catholic charities connected to the Archdiocese of New York.But even before the joke, the reception to Trump's speech was frosty. The event has in the past has served as an occasion for candidates to poke fun at one another, as well as themselves. Trump went into attack mode, saying: "She got kicked off the Watergate commission. How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate commission? Pretty corrupt."At one point, while he was getting booed, Trump responded: "That's okay, I don't know who they're angry at, Hillary, you or I."Trump did make a few jokes at his own expense, bringing up allegations that his wife plagiarized her speech at the Republican National Convention."Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, and then Melania gives exact same speech and people get on her case," he said.Clinton was able to get in some jabs about her opponent, as well. "Some look at Statue of Liberty and see a symbol," she said. "Donald sees a 4. Or maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair."The dinner comes just one night after an acrimonious final presidential debate, where Trump called Clinton a "nasty woman," and Clinton repeated her attacks on Trump's temperament.Read: Trump, Clinton tension seeps into jokes at annual charity dinner
