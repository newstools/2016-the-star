Mombasa MCAs yesterday denied they have received more than Sh32 billion from the National Treasury since devolution started, as alleged by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.About 15 MCAs, led by nominated rep Mohammed Hatimy, said they have received Sh13.45 billion for the first three years of devolution. However, this figure excludes the Sh5.6 billion the county has been allocated for 2016-17.Hatimy, who is the County Assembly Finance Committee chairman, said Nkaissery s statement is inciting and meant to cause chaos in Mombasa. We did not get the money he is talking about. Nkaissery should focus on his mandate and not meddle in the county affairs, he said.Hatimy said the county received Sh3.05 billion in 2013-14 financial year, Sh4.7 billion in 2014-15 and Sh5.7 billion in 2015-16. He said the county has only received a small fraction of the Sh5.6 billion allocated for 2016-17. It seems Nkaissery knows something we don t. He should then tell us where the other money, which amounts to almost Sh16 billion, has gone, because he sits in the Cabinet, he said.
