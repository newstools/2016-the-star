The week-long Lake Naivasha cleanup of illegal nets and boats has improved the catch and the next step is restocking. The fisheries department yesterday said production has risen from 35,000 tonnes to 50,000 per month.Fisheries and beach officials seized 10 boats fishing illegally early this month.During the operation, the officers also recovered hundreds of illegal nets, most of them undersized and placed in the breeding zones.Naivasha subcounty officer Nicholas Kagundu said fishermen using the illegal nets caused the decline in fish catch. Kagundu identified poaching and night fishing as the main problems facing the fisheries sector.He said the department is working with Beach Management Units to end illegal fishing.&ldquo;The county government has acquired four patrol boats to keep off the illegal fishermen,&rdquo; Kagundu said. The seized nets will be burnt next month.&ldquo;We will be marking World Fisheries Day in Naivasha next month and we will burn all the illegal fishing equipment seized as one way of protecting the fisheries sector,&rdquo; Kagundu said.Lake Naivasha Boat Owners&rsquo; Association chairman David Kilo said patrols will be carried out 24 hours a day, &ldquo;until there is sanity in the sector&rdquo;.He expressed concern about the rise in night fishing.Kilo said Beach Management Unit officials are capable. &ldquo;We are working with the fisheries department in dealing with cases of illegal fishing near the shore,&rdquo; he said.Kilo said the planned restocking of the lake is on course. Fishermen have raised Sh500,000 for the restocking, he said.&ldquo;After the cleanup, the next stage is to restock the lake with tilapia fingerlings so we can increase production,&rdquo; Kiloe said.
