Two Bungoma MPs have accused Governor Kenneth Lusaka of not involving county leaders in the planning of the just-concluded trade summit.The Bungoma Investment Trade Conference started on Wednesday last week and ended on Friday.Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi and his Tongaren counterpart Eseli Simiyu said they are disappointed in the manner the event was organised without them, as stakeholders, being involved. Elected leaders were sent invitation letters and text messages to attend the conference, Wamunyinyi said. A trade conference of such magnitude cannot be organised by one person or a section of leaders in the county and they expect it to be a success. Wamunyinyi on Friday said this was the main reason why most leaders skipped the conference.Eseli said all those involved in providing services at the conference came all the way from Nairobi and outside the county. The tents, the sound system and those who provided catering services came all the way from Nairobi, he said.The MPs spoke in Maeni village, Kimilili constituency, when they met Ford Kenya party delegates. They urged Lusaka to involve all the country leaders in future events.During the summit, the county signed close to Sh15 billion agreements with investors.
