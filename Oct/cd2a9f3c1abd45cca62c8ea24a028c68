The Sh1.9 billion assets were recovered in Bungoma, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kwale, Laikipia, Meru, Mombasa, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu counties since 2013. Most of the assets were recovered in Mombasa. They included land in Uhuru Gardens (Sh620 million), the Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach (Sh250 million), Jamhuri Park, the Kenya Ferry Services, Changamwe School, Municipal offices, Malindi Bus Park and the prison. The EACC also recovered land for the Mt Elgon Hospital (Sh145 million), Ministry of Housing Scheme in Kakamega, Diani Airport, and a children&rsquo;s home land and Taifa Park in Kisumu. &ldquo;We have traced more assets but they have not been verified. The figure is likely to go up,&rdquo; says EACC chief executive Halake Waqo (pictured). The agency says the interventions are to address corruption and enhance accountability in the counties. It says there is lack of proper asset inventory, poor management and record keeping.
