Wiper chairman David Musila on Saturday accused Mwingi North MP John Munuve of betraying the Kamba community by abandoning Wiper for Jubilee. You will not be reelected because voters are not amused. I hope you will come back to the fold before you are miserably voted out, Musila said.The two leaders attended the funeral of educationist Willy Nzeka at Ngungani village, Kakuyu division, Mwingi North.Musila said traitors will be punished by voters at the polls. The Kitui senator reprimanded Munuve, who was in 2013 elected on the Wiper ticket. Wiper is the party of the Kamba community while TNA and Jubilee belong to Mt Kenya, Musila said. But Munuve said he would remain in Jubilee to the hilt and at whatever cost.
