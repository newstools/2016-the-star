The Star carried my profile in its October 18 edition in which it reported that I will stand for Narok governor in 2022.That was erroneous because it went against what is in the public domain, and what I had told the reporter during the interview.I want to clarify that I am firmly in the 2017 race to become the next Narok governor.I have taken this conscious decision to save my county from obvious mismanagement and waste of resources that is being presided over by the current administration.Through the protracted consultations I have had in the last couple of months, I am confident I will triumph.By the end of my two terms as governor in 2027, I would like to see Narok acquire its rightful position as one of richest counties in the country because it has vast natural resources which are, unfortunately, not well utilised.Upon my election, I will ensure that the Ward Development Fund is set up in which Sh3 billion will be set aside annually. These funds will be used to develop each of the 30 wards in the county with each ward getting Sh100 million annually.This is very necessary because the county is seriously underdeveloped. By the end of the first five years of devolution, Narok will have received Sh40 billion from the the national shareable revenue, and revenue collected from the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve. Yet, there is no clear picture of how these funds have been spent to benefit the locals.As the county boss, I will ensure each of the six constituencies has a well-quipped Level 4 hospital with well-trained and well-remunerated medical personnel. I will also ensure there is a modern road network connecting Narok and Kilgoris towns within the county. At the moment, people from Narok town have to go through Bomet, Nyamira and Kisii counties to reach Kilgoris town.I will work with the national government to ensure police stations in the county have decent offices and housing for the officers. I commit myselft to buy them extra vehicles to ensure security concerns that residents have continuously raised are addressed.Working closely with the national government will help us improve education standards in the county. As governor, I will ensure that all primary and secondary schools have modern structures and learning materials within the first three years of being in office.
