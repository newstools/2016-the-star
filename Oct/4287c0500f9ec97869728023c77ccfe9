Coast h uman rights groups, irked by lead in Changamwe, &nbsp;have threatened to organise a major demonstration at the Environment ministry's Nairobi officeCentre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action (CJGEA) and Haki Africa said the government has gone silent over the poisoning in Owino Uhuru slum.They noted on Friday that more than&nbsp;300 people have died since 2009 when lead smelting company Metal Refineries EZ was established in the region. The company, which used to extract lead form car batteries for export, was shut down last year after intense lobbying.But CJGEA executive director Phyllis Omido said the Environment Cabinet Secretary Judi Wakhungu has refused to implement the recommendation of a report written last year.Omido, who won the Sh15 million Global Goldman Environment Award for campaigning for the closure of the factory, said the CS must implement the report immediately.She said the report was done by a parliamentary task force which included representatives from the Health ministry, Kenya Bureau of Standards and Water Resource Management Authority.Others int he task force were Occupation Safety and Health, National Environmental Management Authority, the Government Chemist and the Criminal Investigations Department.The task force, which was chaired by Samuel Okuche from the Health ministry, was mandated with decommissioning the smelting industry, undertaking the prosecution of its directors and determining pollution levels in Owino Uhuru.Omido said it was also supposed to discuss the probability of compensating the community.&ldquo;The CS has refused to implement the report which recommended Sh4 billion compensation to the Owino Uhuru community for remediation,&rdquo; she said.The remediation would entail removing lead poison from iron sheets, soil and water in the area.&ldquo;We are now telling the CS that we are not going to continue burying more people dying from lead poison," said the executive director. "If more people die, we shall take their remains to the CS&rsquo;s office in Nairobi and demonstrate."She spoke after removing the body of five-year old Sammy Okello at Coast Provincial General Hospital mortuary. The body died September 31, two years after suffering lead poisoning.Resident Linet Nabwire died while giving birth lat year, after doctors found she had 238microgrammes of lead per deciliter of blood. Omido said a postmortem confirmed she died from lead poisoning. She added that more than 900 people out of the 3,000 living in Owino Uhuru tested positive for lead poisoning last year. Haki Africa programmes officer Francis Auma said they will join hands with CJGEA to ensure Owino Uhuru residents get justice from the government. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
