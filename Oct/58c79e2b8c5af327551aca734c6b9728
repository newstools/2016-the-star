Former minister Prof Margaret Kamar has launched her campaign for Uasin Gishu senator after withdrawing from the governor s race last week. Last time I contested for governor but I have realised I can serve the people of Uasin Gishu better as senator because I have the skills and experience, she said. Kamar spoke at Kapseret during the burial of politician Wesley Kirorei. My experience will help me fight for more resources for the county. Kamar has not announced her party. In 2013, the former Higher Education minister vied on the ODM ticket against Governor Jackson Mandago.Kamar said she will work with all the communities to ensure devolution succeeds.The Jubilee Party has the largest following in the region, but there has been speculation that she may join the National Vision Party, headed by former minister Nicholas Biwott.
