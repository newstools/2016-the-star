The Friends of City Park have raised the alarm over what they call a new plot to grab the land.Assistant administrator Sylvia Ochanda yesterday said new beacons were put up at the weekend. She said they were placed behind and in front of the main parking area, down to the Boscowen Collection point. The covert operation was executed when few people were present. It is ironic that just after celebrating Mashujaa Day, the park would again be put under threat, Ochanda said.Last month, the Friends of City Park held a meeting with residents, NGOs and businesses at the National Museum of Kenya to discuss how to conserve and protect the park.They resolved that a multi-agency team be formed to manage the park and a fence be erected to protect it. Friends of City Park chairperson Catherine Ngarachu said the park was originally 90ha, but 30ha have been grabbed by private developers since 1923, when it was declared a public utility.
