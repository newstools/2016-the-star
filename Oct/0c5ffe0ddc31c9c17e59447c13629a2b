Kenya Lionesses head coach Kelvin Wambua has included three new faces into the provisional training squad ahead of the Dubai Sevens Invitational tournament in December.Impala s Anne Njeri and Mwamba duo Ashley Awuor and Sarah Oluchi were handed their debuts into the team that resumed training on Monday. The three players bring depth to the team and will give us more options and quality in future assignments. They are exciting players with potential and are part and parcel of our development plans. We will have our conditioning coach Laventer Oguda work with them specifically to improve their strength as I fine tune their skills and game understanding, said Wambua.The Lionesses best performance at the International Invitational women s tournament was last year when they won bowl after a 12-10 win over the West Coast Vikings Ladies. Wambua said he is aiming at much better performance this year. My plan this season is to get our players back in the right shape in terms of fitness and conditioning as well as incorporate skill set development such as passing, tackling and contact, said Wambua.Dubai has been competitive over the years and most non-core teams use it as a platform earn World Rugby s invitation to the women s Sevens World Series and the Lionesses will have to put up a good show It will be important for us to get our patterns right and post some good results to catch the attention of world rugby too. Our focus shifts to the 2018 women s Sevens World Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens, he added.
