They are exciting players with potential and are part and parcel of our development plans. We will have our conditioning coach Laventer Oguda work with them specifically to improve their strength as I fine tune their skills and game understanding,&rdquo; said Wambua.The Lionesses best performance at the International Invitational women&rsquo;s tournament was last year when they won bowl after a 12-10 win over the West Coast Vikings Ladies.
