Deputy President William Ruto s allies in Rift Valley are planning a meeting to discuss the 2017 polls and the alliance between the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities in Jubilee.The development follows fears a clique of powerful individuals from Central are planning to sabotage Ruto s 2022 presidential bid by supporting former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago is among the key leaders in Rift Valley planning the meeting that will lead to a declaration on the 2017 and 2022 polls.Mandago yesterday said some powerbrokers from Central have been hosting secret meetings to undercut Ruto. We will have our meeting and also name also those involved in the plan to sabotage Ruto politically, he said.Mandago did not reveal when the meeting will take place, but sources say it will be held next month. MPs, senators, MCAs and elders will participate.Mandago said Central has a political debt to pay for the support it received from the Kalenjin community and Ruto in 2013. During the 2022 elections, they will have to vote for Ruto because it was a deal. We backed them in 2013 and we will do the same next year, he said. Dawa ya deni ni kulipa, na hakuna njia ingine. (The only remedy for a debt is to pay it back).Rift Valley politicians are anxious a scheme has been hatched to tarnish Ruto s name and make it hard for him to run in 2022. For those who have dreams that they will tarnish Ruto s name through someone called Boniface Mwangi, so that by 2022 they start giving excuses, we will not accept that, Mandago said.He said the plan to ask Kenneth to run for Nairobi governor next year is part of the plan to sabotage Ruto s ambitions in 2022. We even know where they meet at night to plan moves against DP Ruto, Mandago said.
