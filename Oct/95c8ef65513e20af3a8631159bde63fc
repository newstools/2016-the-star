MPs, senators, MCAs and elders will participate.Mandago said Central has a political debt to pay for the support it received from the Kalenjin community and Ruto in 2013.&ldquo;During the 2022 elections, they will have to vote for Ruto because it was a deal. We backed them in 2013 and we will do the same next year,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Dawa ya deni ni kulipa, na hakuna njia ingine.&rdquo; (The only remedy for a debt is to pay it back).Rift Valley politicians are anxious a scheme has been hatched to tarnish Ruto&rsquo;s name and make it hard for him to run in 2022.&ldquo;For those who have dreams that they will tarnish Ruto&rsquo;s name through someone called Boniface Mwangi, so that by 2022 they start giving excuses, we will not accept that,&rdquo; Mandago said.He said the plan to ask Kenneth to run for Nairobi governor next year is part of the plan to sabotage Ruto&rsquo;s ambitions in 2022.&ldquo;We even know where they meet at night to plan moves against DP Ruto,&rdquo; Mandago said.
