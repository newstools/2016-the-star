The Kenya Revenue Authority is investigating five cars impounded yesterday morning along Mombasa Road for evading tax.The vehicles which include three Range Rovers, a Toyota Landcruiser Prado V8 and a Subaru Forrester are being held at Nairobi County Police Headquarters. They were flagged down by the flying squad after a tip off.The five are among some 300 vehicles profiled earlier in the year for non-payment of taxes and improper registration procedures.The motor vehicles with irregularities are KAY939L, Land Rover Sport, KCH956T Range Rover Vogue, KCG899V a Range Rover Vogue, Toyota Landcruiser Prado V8 registration number KCB786J, and Subaru Forrester registration number KCE219D.Early this month, the authority intercepted a container with two Range Rovers that had been wrongly declared, at the Port of Mombasa following intelligence from the United Kingdom. The vehicles, in a 40-foot container, had been declared as bicycles, bales of clothing and engines, but scanned images including those from the intelligence source contradicted the declaration. Reports indicated that the vehicles, destined for Uganda, would have denied KRA up to Sh15 million in revenue. Only this week, a Nairobi court heard that a Range Rover that was impounded having accrued Sh6.5 million in unpaid tax was stolen from the UK. The vehicle belonged to Water CS Eugene Wamalwa. The case is on-going.The taxman has in the recent past publicly listed 124 vehicles comprising of sports utility vehicles and related luxury vehicles, with outstanding tax issues.The vehicles have been under investigation for tax evasion and other fraudulent schemes. Some were initially declared as transit cargo but later dumped in the country. KRA has tightened the noose against masterminds of the syndicate that evades tax by mis-declaring and under-declaring goods.
