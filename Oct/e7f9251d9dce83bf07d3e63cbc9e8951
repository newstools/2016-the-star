Two ODM MPs have given the President 48 hours to apologise to Luos for not recognising former VP Jaramogi Oginga and Cord leader Raila Odinga on Mashujaa Day.Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) accused President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee administration of "taking the hatred for Nyanza people and the Luo community to a worrying level".Wandayi, who is party secretary of political affairs, further said Uhuru cannot preach national unity and cohesion while openly despising some leaders. When you disrespect Jaramogi and Raila then we as leaders of the Luo community shall disrespect you even more. We have no business respecting you if you continue to disrespect our leaders," he said.Read: Raila skips Mashujaa Day fete as Kalonzo, Wetang'ula attendThe MP addressed journalists on Friday accompanied by Nyando's Fred Outa and Kisumu politician Richard Ogendo.Wandayi further said the omission was a deliberate attempt to humiliate the leaders yet they played major roles in Kenya's first and second liberation.He noted Nyanza did not take it kindly and required an unequivocal apology as Oginga and Raila are known across the country and beyond its borders.The MP said it will not be "business as usual" as Uhuru has embarked on a "futile attempt to revise history by honouring home guards while humiliating the real heroes"."Uhuru has now crossed the red line and the die is cast. Let him be reminded that Jaramogi stood in the gap while his father was in prison," he said.The Nyando MP said the freedom millions of Kenyans are enjoying resulted from the personal sacrifices of people like Oginga The opposition will not have any engagement with the Jubilee government until the President apologies to the Luo community,' said Outa.He reiterated that the President crossed the line, a personal vendetta with the Odinga family notwithstanding.Outa also asked Uhuru to stop personalising national holidays as the office he holds requires him to recognise all Kenyans.He noted it was wrong for the head of state to display "his hatred towards a certain community" on a national day whose proceedings were aired on live TV."We cannot forget Raila, the father of the devolution Kenyans are enjoying now," he added. If the President can ignore this and give the Odinga family a blackout then this is political and it means he is afraid of Raila."The MP added that a feud with the Odingas should be solved quickly and leaders who have played key roles in Kenya's history recognised.Uhuru also failed to recognise former Minister Tom Mboya during the celebrations in Machakos county on Thursday. But he mentioned freedom fighter Achieng Oneko and Siaya Senator James Orengo in his speech.Read: Kalonzo: I will defeat Uhuru, Ruto next year
