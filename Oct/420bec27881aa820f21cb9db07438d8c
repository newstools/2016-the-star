Screenshots from a county WhatsApp group show a hot-tempered senator abusing a member of the public (one Kiplimo). The senator is a vocal politician who brags he lives by the word of God in the WhatsApp county group. The civilian Kiplimo works in Nairobi county as an assistant clerk. From the screenshots, it is clear that the senator is unable to control his temper, even when he declaims, I am human and have a heart . The senator is also reminded that he is a leader who dresses decently and should respect his image but goes ahead to call Kiplimo a mad moron in the market . The senator comes from the Rift Valley and is an ardent supporter of Deputy President William Ruto (pictured). *********** A Jubilee activist with connections among the top Jubilee leadership and who goes by the nickname Mama Bora appears to be causing some ripples in Nairobi. Our moles say her entry into a traditionally Cord constituency in the city has left a number of opposition strategists shaken. Following her announcement to vie for the seat, we are told that some ODM members have been in touch with her to persuade her not to run. Some were recently heard to say that with no strong candidate in sight from Cord, they believe the lady may upset the situation, which they say may be costly for Raila Odinga at the Presidential level.************Rumour that Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti may team up for the governor race next year are causing discomfort in Governor Hassan Joho s camp. A close ally of Joho s was heard telling his friends at a restaurant in Westlands that this combination has all the ingredients of getting him out of office. He said this would see the governor easily lose the Luo vote, part of the Arab vote and the Mijikenda vote leaving him with nothing much to hold on to. ************* Makueni speaker Stephen Ngelu appears to have lost the war against Governor Kivutha KIbwana. Ngelu has been frustrating the governor, bragging to be working closely with DP William Ruto. Word has it that Ngelu has been positioning himself as the DP s point man in the county and has not shied away from announcing he is working with the dissolved URP to intimidate political opponents. But he did not feature anywhere during Ruto s tour of the county two weeks ago, where the DP was accompanied by Kibwana and his deputy Adelina Mwau.
