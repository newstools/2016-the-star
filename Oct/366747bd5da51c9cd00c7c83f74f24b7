South Africa is withdrawing from the ICC, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday, a move that would take effect one year after notice is formally received by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.A UN spokesman declined to confirm receipt of the document, which is signed by South Africa's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and dated October 19."The Republic of South Africa has found that its obligations with respect to the peaceful resolution of conflicts at times are incompatible with the interpretation given by the International Criminal Court," according to the document.South Africa's foreign affairs department spokesman Clayson Monyela declined to comment, saying the justice minister would hold a news conference on the issue at 0800 GMT.The International Criminal Court, which opened in July 2002 and has 124 member states, is the first legal body with permanent international jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.Media reports said South Africa had formally begun the process of withdrawing and that diplomats have notified the UN of the move, accusing the ICC of bias against African countries.Last year, the country refused to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and war crimes. He was attending an African Union summit in Johannesburg.Bashir denies allegations he committed atrocities in Sudan's troubled western Darfur region.Several media outlets say they have obtained a copy of the 'Instrument of Withdrawal', signed by South Africa's foreign minister."The Republic of South Africa has found that its obligations with respect to the peaceful resolution of conflicts at times are incompatible with the interpretation given by the ICC," the document says.There are also conflicting legal opinions as to whether South Africa can leave the ICC without parliamentary approval.Human Rights Watch criticised the reported move."South Africa's proposed withdrawal from the ICC shows startling disregard for justice from a country long seen as a global leader on accountability for victims of the gravest crimes," said Dewa Mavhinga, the NGO's Africa division senior researcher."It's important both for South Africa and the region that this runaway train be slowed down and South Africa's hard-won legacy of standing with victims of mass atrocities be restored," Mavhinga said.Last year, South African warned it might leave the ICC.The reported move to leave comes a week after the South African President Jacob Zuma visited Kenya, a country that has been highly critical of the ICC ever since the prosecutor charged its President Uhuru Kenyatta with crimes against humanity.He denied the charges, and the trial later collapsed due to lack of evidence.Two weeks ago Burundi became the first country to express its intent to pull out of the ICC - a decision described by the court as "a setback in the fight against impunity".Previously, the African Union has urged member states not to co-operate with the ICC, accusing it of bias against Africa.The 124-member ICC opened in 2002. It is the first legal body with permanent international jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.Read: Nkurunziza signs decree for Burundi to leave ICC
