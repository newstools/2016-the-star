President Uhuru Kenyatta has been criticised for his remarks that corruption is frustrating him.During the Governance and Accountability Summit last week, Uhuru said there is little he can do to fight graft. ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire yesterday said the the admission was &ldquo;unfortunate and reckless&rdquo;.&ldquo;No one other than the President himself vowed to fi ght corruption and instill transparency and openness in governance. He pledged in the Jubilee manifesto that corruption will be a thing of the past,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.&ldquo;It is most unfortunate we have a commander-in-chief that cannot deliver what he promised.&rdquo;Bosire said the President &ldquo;has lost control in the management of the affairs of the country&rdquo;.
