The Mombasa political rivalry carried on during Mashujaa Day celebrations, with Nyali MP Hezron Awiti stealing the show in Governor Hassan Joho's absence.When the two have shared platforms in past events, they have traded insults and even engaged in personal attacks.Awiti stormed out of the county stadium during last year's fete after &ldquo;disrespectful utterances&rdquo; by his Kisauni counterpart Rashid Bedzimba, who is Joho's confidant.Bedzimba, who spoke immediately after Awiti, asked him to drop his governor ambition in a speech that was disrupted for several minutes.But Awiti was the only opposition contender for governor at the celebrations held at Tononoka grounds on Thursday.The Wiper treasurer took advantage of this to hammer Joho with accusations of incompetence.Read: Awiti, Joho fight to control Nyali politics, win upcountry votersAlso read: Kalonzo asks Awiti, Omar to join forces to beat JohoAwiti claimed the Governor gave the event a wide berth because he was afraid of facing him and the electorate as he has "mismanaged" his office.Joho and five Mombasa MPs did not attend the event but Deputy Governor Hazel Katana was present.&ldquo;It is evident you have run down the county and failed to tackle the horny land and drugs menace," said Awiti.He had steered clear of personal attacks on leaders and told the Star he expected other leaders to reciprocate.The MP also criticised youths who attempted to disrupt his political rally last Sunday.Goons said to have been hired attempted to attack him but were repulsed by his supporters.
