A nominated MCA has gone into hiding after she allegedly accidentally posted her nude photos on a WhatsApp group on Friday.A source told the Star the MCA posted her nude photo with an unidentified man. She is said to have gone missing over embarrassment and is communicating only through her brother.The brother said his sister does not know how to use digital devices and she is a church leader. He said, She is a church leader and cannot post such things on social media, she is married and she has grownup children. Immediately after the photo was posted on the Vihiga County Development group at 9.12pm on Friday, suspended Vihiga speaker Dan Chitwah responded, saying, Mheshimiwa undo that post .....itakuletea njaa. People on social media have said the MCA must resign because she has let the entire community down.
