More than 100 people who were living and doing businesses on Amboseli Road in Namanga town have been evicted and their structures flattened.The resolve by the county government to bring down the structures went against a High Court injunction issued by Justice Lucy Gacheru.On Wednesday last week, an excavator operator was injured after he was pelted with stones as he attempted to bring down houses condemned by Kajiado county government in Namanga.The excavator operator, who had been in the town for several days, had managed to bring down the first house when stones started raining on him as other county government officials sought refuge at the local police station.The residents are opposed to the demolition of their houses and business premises claiming they were allocated the plots in the late 1970&rsquo;s by the late Local Government Minister, Shapashina Oloitiptip.The county government is constructing a market near the houses and is clearing the area to provide an access road to the facility. Trade County Chief Officer, Gideon Ketente, declared the residents were illegally allocated the plots and the regional government has no other option other than to bring down the houses.&ldquo;We have said they must move out of the plots that they have erected residential and business premises because they are there illegally,&rdquo; Ketente said on phone.The residents on September 30 acquired a court order stopping the county government from demolishing the houses and the same was served to the county secretary, Kennedy Kerei.But Ketente claimed he has not been served with the order from the Environment and Land Court at Milimani, Nairobi signed by Justice Gacheru.Ibrahim, Issack and Company Advocates is acting on behalf of the residents.Paul Mwangagi, speaking on behalf of the residents, said they have been paying land rates for the last 38 years on their plots and therefore the land is legally theirs.Tension remained high throughout Thursday last week until Sunday as the residents kept vigil on their property.Area MCA, Hosea Toshi who did not get enough support from the town in the last general election, said he supported the eviction of the people who were illegally allocated the plots.&ldquo;I have severally said they must go and there is no negotiation about it. We want to bring sanity to our town, full-stop,&rdquo; declared Toshi.
