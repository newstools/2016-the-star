Is Jogoo House aware that the 670 AP officers admitted at the AP Training College in Embakasi for the Inspector course are being forced to pay Sh1,400 for a cup, plate and a spoon, and Sh300 for a spring file? The officers turned up with the items on October 7 as required, but are being told to pay more money - for another set of the same items. What is even more suspicious is that the officers have been ordered to pay Sh300 for a file that costs between Sh25-40 in stationery shops and Sh1,400 for items that they can, and have, acquired for less than Sh500. Someone is likely to make more than Sh1 million from the officers, who cannot report to seniors for fear of victimization. They are required to pay the Sh1,700 each by the close of the business day today, but are not aware of who has issued the order. The officers on the five months&rsquo; training preceding promotion to the position of Inspector of Police want Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet (pictured) and DIG Samuel Arachi to intervene.************ODM lawmakers who were de-whipped from House committees were overhead bragging that the move is inconsequential as they have been promised huge money by Jubilee Party to compensate them for the allowances they will miss. One of them said he was called by someone from the Office of the President and told not to worry as some money will be disbursed at the end of the week to cushion them from the negative financial implications anticipated with their withdrawal.************A governor from Nyanza is in the spot for accompanying several of his aides and staff who are considered surplus to requirements when a county boss appears for grilling in the Senate. Some of the staff he brings along include several lower-cadre staff for carrying files and documents from the vehicles to the committee room and some joyrider female staff whose presence has raised eyebrows. Our small bird hovering around the corridors of Parliament heard one of the staff complain that some lady - a new entrant in the governor&rsquo;s team - was stealing the show from her of late and that her hitherto rather cozy working relationship with the county boss has deteriorated. She is unhappy that she missed one of the grilling sessions after being edged out of the delegation.***********A Tala High School form four student has been forced to study for his KCSE exam in Wajir, after the head teacher declined to allow him back in school. Despite his parents being forced to buy three rolls of 6ft chain-link wire, the candidate, whose only crime is keeping away from his truant colleagues, has been living in Wajir.
