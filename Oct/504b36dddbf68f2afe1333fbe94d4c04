Farmers will now sell a 90kg bag of maize at a more profitable price of Sh3,000 up from the previous sh2,300.Deputy President William Ruto said on Friday that the new prices will be subject to a progressive review each year.He said the government will further reduce the cost of farming for farmers. We want to ensure that farmers make reasonable profits from their produce so that they can be able to reproduce again next year, he said. The DP said that the price was reached at after consultations between the ministry of Agriculture and a committee that was tasked to evaluate the prices. We want to make sure that we work on the forces of supply and demand to make sure that we don t end up penalizing the farmers or the consumers, Ruto said.The DP was speaking at the Kitale Agriculture Society of Kenya (ASK) show in Trans Nzoia County.He at the same time instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to buy fertilizer from local manufacturers to promote local industries.The Deputy President was accompanied by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett, Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba, Senator Henry Ndiema and Women Representative Janet Nangabo Wanyama.Ruto also said that the Government has spent Sh20 billion on subsidized fertilizer. He asked the Ministry of Agriculture to expedite the registration of farmers so that the Government can cut out middlemen who take advantage of the subsidized fertilizer project. Fertilizer must not only be soil specific but also crop specific for every region, said the DP.The Deputy President at the same time asked local fertilizer producers to be up to the task because the government wants to promote local manufacturers.His sentiments were echoed by Bett who said his ministry is fast-tracking the registration of farmers.Bett said that farmers' register will ensure the government only deals with farmers and not traders when buying maize and issuing the subsidized fertilizer. We will ensure those who bring maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) are farmers, said the Agriculture CS. Ruto appealed to county governments to facilitate the diversification of farming in the counties and encourage farming of other crops other than the usual crops.He lauded County Governments for supporting farmers and modernizing agriculture. County governments have become valuable partners in the expansion and transformation of agriculture, he said: Khaemba said Trans Nzoia County has encouraged farmers to grow other crops other than maize, such as coffee and bananas.
