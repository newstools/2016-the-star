The National Examinations Council has been urged to use helicopters to transport exam papers directly from headquarters to Garissa centres without secure storage containers.Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, branch Knut secretary Abdirizak Hussein said authorities have ignored their appeals to provide adequate containers.The KCPE exam is to start on Tuesday, KCSE will start on November 7. Tests in science, practical subjects and foreign languages began last week.Hussein said the system Knec wants to use &mdash; moving students from their schools to centres with containers &mdash; will inconvenience them and undermine their performance.&ldquo;The ministry&rsquo;s formula is too taxing, expensive and tiring. Students will be forced to travel for kilometres to unfamiliar environments. This will hurt their scores,&rdquo; Hussein said.He said making teachers escort papers from station to station threatens their security. &ldquo;What Knut pays invigilators and supervisors is not worth risking one&rsquo;s life for,&rdquo; Hussein said.&ldquo;We request authorities give this attention it deserves since parents and students are complaining. If something is not done, rhe results will not be as good as we had expected. And we will blame Knec and the Education ministry,&rdquo; he said.
