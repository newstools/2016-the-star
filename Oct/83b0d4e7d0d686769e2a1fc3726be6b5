Two tycoons accused of illegally taking over a family business will know the ruling of the court in December.Brothers Diamond Hasham Lalji and Ahmed Hasham Lalji moved to the Court of Appeal in 2014 after DPP Keriako Tobiko recommended charges of fraud against them.In 2012, the Attorney General had recommended charges against the brothers for allegedly transferring a company to themselves fraudulently.The inquiry by anti-corruption commission in 2007 showed that Diamond and Ahmed fraudulently transferred the business and assets of the company worth Sh40 million to other shareholders.The respondents in the application are the Attorney General, DPP, Commissioner of Police, EACC and Bahanurali Hasham.During the hearing yesterday, their lawyer Waweru Gatonye told the court that the case has been pending for 18 years."In view of the time taken and the history involved, there is a danger of any prosecution ensuing therein being constructed not only as an abuse of court process but also infringements of constitutional rights of the suspects," Gatonye said.The complainant in the case, Bahanurali, represented by lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, urged the court to allow the two to be prosecution.Abdullahi urged the judges to consider Article 157 that states that the DPP will not require the consent of any person or authority for the commencement of criminal proceedings. The case was heard before three judges &ndash; Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and Mohammed Jamilla.The case will come up for judgement on December 16.
