West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo and Civil Aviation Authority chairman Samuel Poghisio on Saturday said corruption has infiltrated Kenya and denies citizens the most crucial services.Lonyangapuo said many parts of the country lack basic facilities such as schools and roads because funds meant for such projects are looted.He said 53 years after Independence, some children cannot sit national exams, as there are no exam centres. Lonyangapuo said most county officers languished in poverty before devolution but now drive top-of-the-range cars. The officers have accumulated wealth within the shortest time possible.It s high time they are investigated to save Kenyans from this exploitation, he said. Poghisio said corruption is visible in the counties and residents do not need the help of auditors to know corrupt officers. Their living standards can easily tell if they have looted taxpayers money.
