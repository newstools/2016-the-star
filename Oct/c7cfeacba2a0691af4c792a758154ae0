Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said leaders who engage in what he calls parrot talk are less development-oriented than quiet leaders.&ldquo;A good leader is the one who does his or her work quietly without attracting much attention. Those who talk too much do little,&rdquo; he said.Speaking during a fundraiser at St Joseph&rsquo;s Musokoto Secondary School in Nambale subcounty, the governor said his government aims to empower the people. Ojaamong said he will ensure more development projects are launched. &ldquo;My government has helped fund the construction of Nambale University and many other institutions across the county. We shall continue supporting education,&rdquo; he said.Ojaamong praised Nambale MP John Bunyasi for playing a pivotal role in developing the county. &ldquo;Bunyasi does his work with precision. If there is a problem with roads he consults my CEC. He does the same in health matters. These are the leaders we want. The Teso South MP does the same,&rdquo; Ojamoong said.Roads executive Bernard Waite said 1,600km of county roads are in good condition, adding class A, B and C roads are under the national government.
