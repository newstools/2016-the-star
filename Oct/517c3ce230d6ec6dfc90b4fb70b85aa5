A group advocating Omogusii unity has endorsed Kisii Senator Chris Obure for governor. Obure was backed on Sunday as a rival group held a parallel rally and backed Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s reelection. Ongwae did not attend the meeting in Magenche, Bomachoge Borabu constituency, as he was in the US on official duty.Eight MPs who have been meeting in the nine constituencies endorsed Obure at Nyabonge in Bobasi constituency. The group supported former Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution chairman Charles Nyachae for senator. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi could be Obure&rsquo;s running mate.Obure accepted the endorsement and pledged to send Ongwae home in 2017. &ldquo;I played a key role in his election but he has let us down,&rdquo; the senator, who has ditched ODM, said. &ldquo;We are committing many resources that are not translated into helping change the lives of our people.&rdquo; But the Ongwae group accused the Obure faction of excluding members of the community. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the language of exclusivity. Why are they leaving other people out of their purported unity talks? We want an arrangement which includes us all,&rdquo; Sam Ongeri, Kenya&rsquo;s Ambassador to UN Habitat, said.
