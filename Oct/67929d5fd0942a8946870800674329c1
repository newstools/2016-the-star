President Uhuru Kenyatta has called off his official visit to Angola following the terror attack that left people 12 dead in Mandera on Tuesday.The President asked DP William Ruto to represent him at the meeting slated for Wednesday at the country's capital Luanda.The meeting's agenda is to rally African countries on a regional oversight mechanism for peace and security cooperation."This is in solidarity with the families who have lost their loved ones, and those injured, whom he wishes a speedy recovery," State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said.In the statement on Tuesday, Esipisu said on behalf of Uhuru that: "We recognise that to win this war, we must remain united.""One way in which we can show that unity and defend our republic is by cooperating closely with our security agencies."The spokesman conveyed the President's condolences to victims' families and said Uhuru will stand with them.Esipisu said Kenyans will not permit division along religious lines and that security agencies will do everything in the pursuit of justice."Every Kenyan of goodwill, Christian and Muslim alike, knows that it is wrong to take innocent life," he said.Read: Twelve people killed in Mandera terror attackMore on this: Mandera's 'sufficient' security too afraid to patrol, Roba says after al Shabaab raidSuspected al Shabaab terrorists attacked Bishaare Hotel in Mandera town using grenades and IEDs at around 3:30am on Tuesday.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said in a separate address that security agencies were pursuing those behind the attack.The CS said in Kwale that they will work round the clock to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book."We are putting appropriate measures to ensure citizens across the country are secure and safeguarded,he said.Nkaissery refuted claims by residents in the area that police did not respond to warnings about the attack."Our officers were on patrol; that is why they managed to repulse the suspects and protected the lives of more people who could have been injured," the CS said.Read: Police corruption steering al Shabaab ambushes, Mandera leaders say
