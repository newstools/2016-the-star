The Senate has been urged to summon Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia for allegedly spending too much county cash on personal publicity.Kandara MP Alice Wahome said Wairia advertises &ldquo;meaningless&rdquo; projects on radio stations.&ldquo;The Wairia-led government has been wasting money on publicity and the projects they advertise are meaningless, like the cow sheds constructed all over the county,&rdquo; she said.Wahome spoke at Karugia Secondary School on Monday after presenting a Sh450,000 cheque to build the institution&rsquo;s dining hall.&ldquo;None of the sheds is being used. Murang&rsquo;a residents want answers on where the money comes from. Why hype shoddy projects in the media? Why can&rsquo;t they do good projects that can sell themselves instead of having to advertise them?&rdquo; she said.Wahome urged Senator Kembi Gitura to write a letter to the governor, asking the sources of his cash.She said Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo should be present when Wairia is summoned to explain the source of Sh237 million the county used on advertisements last year.Wahome said Wairia places his picture on every county project banner. &ldquo;He has even placed his photo on banners publicising projects done by MPs. I&rsquo;ve seen his photo on a banner advertising a boda boda shed constructed by the Kandara CDF at Ngurweini as well as on a water project,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is gross misconduct and should not be left unchecked. He is even using government vehicles for his campaigns. That is wrong and should stop,&rdquo; Wahome said. Wairia was unavailable for comment.
