Nakumatt is facing cashflow problems which has affected operations and unsettled suppliers.The giant retailer admitted the problem on Thursday, following rumours that suppliers have gone for months without payment.Managing director Atur Shah said the retailer is already in talks with unidentified local and international financiers for a loan that will help retire existing debt which has strained its cash flow.He said the financing facility will allow the retailer to regain footing with full supplier settlements and sustainably continue with an ongoing expansion plan. Like any other business operating in this market, Nakumatt Holdings has faced a number of unforeseen business challenges. These challenges range from a depressed economy, higher operating costs and (other) extraneous factors, he said in a statement on Thursday. As expected, these factors have impacted operations on many fronts, including cashflow. A number of suppliers interviewed a month ago said Nakumatt has throughout this year delayed payment for delivered goods without giving a solid explanation. This is the first time that we have seen Nakumatt delaying payment for goods, said a supplier who requested to remain anonymous for fear of being victimised.Nakumatt has 60 stores, which generates over Sh55 billion annually, making it the biggest retailer in the East African region. It is trailed by Tuskys, Naivas and Uchumi, respectively.The problem of paying suppliers has been synonymous with the state owned Uchumi Supermarkets.Uchumi's debt to suppliers had piled up to Sh3.6 billion in January, forcing it to operate with near empty stores for the better part of this year after suppliers withdrew goodwill.Shah said they have undertaken organisational reengineering which includes review of the current supply terms and a management enhancement program. We have also integrated an advanced warehouse management system allowing us to hold optimum stocks based on daily shop floor off take in line with global benchmarks. All our suppliers and business partners are encouraged to continue engaging with us, as we pursue a resolution to the challenges, he said.
