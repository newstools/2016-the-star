Politicians from the terror-prone Northeastern region have blamed the recent sporadic attacks by al Shabaab militants on endemic corruption within Kenya&rsquo;s security forces.The elected leaders said the government has failed to deal with the terror group&rsquo;s insurgency because &ldquo;money-hungry elements within security agencies&rdquo; frustrate efforts.They included Senator Billow Kerrow, MPs Mohammed Mohamud (Mandera West), woman representative Fathia Mahbub, Nohame Huka (Mandera East), Hassan Osman (nominated), Barry Shill (Fafi) and Tarbaj&rsquo;s Mohamed Elmi.They were reacting to the Tuesday dawn attack at a Mandera Hotel by suspected Shabaab militia, in which 12 nonresidents were killed. Mohamud accused Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers of arresting suspects and extorting money from them in exchange for their freedom.
