Activist Boniface Mwangi has accused Deputy President William Ruto of injuring his reputation by portraying him as a perpetual drunk.In a counterclaim to Ruto s defamation suit, Mwangi says the words, broadcast by K24 on September 28, were false, malicious and part of his sustained hatred and self-serving vendetta against him.In an affidavit, Mwangi says he will ably demonstrate the allegations he has made against Ruto. The activist said being a public figure and the second in command, Ruto should expect uninhibited and intense public scrutiny of character and conduct , especially on issues of the public interest. There can be no doubt that the freedom of expression, coupled with the right to receive and impart information, is a core value of any democratic society and deserves the utmost legal protection, Mwangi said.He said as a public officer, Ruto ought to conduct himself with decorum as expected of a state officer under the constitution. Mwangi said Ruto should desist from making false and malicious statements. The words were calculated to disparage and injure my reputation and bring me to public scandal, odium and contempt in my personal and my professional career, he said.Ruto has sued the activist for defamation over a tweet he posted linking him to the death of Jacob Juma. Through his lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, the DP said the accusations were scandalous and injured my reputation . The tweet, Ruto said, injured his character and credit, and lowered his standing and estimation among Kenya s high-thinking people. He said his name has been brought into public scandal and ridicule, and that his feelings were hurt.But Mwangi shot back, saying the DP has no reputation worth being protected by a court of law. He said the suit does not disclose any reasonable cause of action.Mwangi says as a journalist, he ought to be allowed to freely express his thoughts, fears and opinions.He said he will ably demonstrate that Ruto is a vindictive person who abhors any form of competition, challenge to his personal and executive authority .
