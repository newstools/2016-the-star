Sixty per cent of the tourists to Mt Kenya in the last year have been domestic visitors, the Meru government has said.The Up in The Mountain Bible Mission sponsored the replacement of a monument of the Bible on the Lenana Peak, 4,985m above sea level. The monument was built in 2013, but was vandalised.The mission organised the largest group of visitors to the peak at a go 40 people. They included two county tourism officers, porters, guides and medical personnel who trekked about 25km to reach the peak.County tourism director Dennis Kinoti on Saturday said, Meru county is home to Mt Kenya. Kenyans should explore our parks and reserves. The Sirimon Gate is among the best and popular routes to climbing Mt Kenya. The county government works very well with the Kenya Wildlife Service and other partners that have a common objective of promoting tourism. Mt Kenya National Park senior warden Simon Gitau praised the KWS and the county government for supporting local tourism and conservation.He said lack of infrastructure has been a setback. I believe we can accomplish more through marketing and job creation to cultivate a symbiotic relationship that benefits us all by doing business, Gitau said.Up in the Mountain Bible Mission chairman David Oletetu said the Bible monument honours Kenya s fallen heroes. We have believers from different denominations. Kenyans should take advantage of our resources. Climb Mt Kenya and visit our national parks and reserves, he said.
