The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee wants politicians implicated in graft barred from running.Chairman Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o yesterday said the panel is working on a report, which recommends that all politicians be vetted.He spoke yesterday during an interview with the Ramogi FM morning show. Nyong&rsquo;o said the committee has received many queries from the Auditor General on the misuse of public resources in the counties.He said, &ldquo;We want to realise the full dream of devolution. W need to eliminate leaders who are out to squander public resources for selfish gain.&rdquo;Nyong&rsquo;o said the report recommends MCAs be supervised when carrying out their oversight duties.He said many ward representatives are compromised by the county executive. &ldquo;We have seen some MCAs engage in physical fights just because they are denied their share of bribes from the executive. This hampers service delivery,&rdquo; Nyong&rsquo;o said.He said the report will be available to the public if approved. Nyong&rsquo;o said, &ldquo;No governor has been prosecuted over corruption allegations, despite the soaring levels of graft reported in the counties. Most cases in which governors are implicated drag.&rdquo;He said many counties lag behind in development because of &ldquo;poor leadership&rdquo;Last month, senators warned governors who fail to satisfactorily answer audit queries that they risk being barred from defending their seats.They put on notice county Finance executives, chief officers and their procurement counterparts, under whose dockets audit queries fall.PAC committee member Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said, &ldquo;A governor with unanswered audit queries will have to sweat to get clearance certificates from the IEBC.&rdquo;
