ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday said President Uhuru Kenyatta has failed as a shepherd and run for cover with the ravenous wolves of corruption. He urged Uhuru to resign over what he termed his “inability to deal with runaway graft”. If Uhuru fails to resign, Kenyans should assume the office is vacant, he said. Mudavadi said the President lacks political will and commitment to fight corruption. “He has thrown in the towel at the altar of corruption cartels. Recently at his residence, and for once, the President was honest with Kenyans that he is defeated. He has given up on corruption,” he said in a statement. “Unless heads begin to roll, Kenyans are on their own, because the shepherd ran for cover with the wolves. Kenyans are dire need of a new shepherd.” Mudavadi said it is not enough that Kenyans are outraged by the latest corruption scandal at the Health ministry, where gatekeepers “have stolen from mothers and their unborn babies”. He said the theft of Sh5.3 billion in the Health ministry can only have happened with connivance in high places. “The money was meant to save mothers and children during and after birth. Sh5.3 billion is not just numbers but money that would have bought 10 mobile health clinics for each of the 47 counties. A government that allows its officers to steal from these vulnerable Kenyans can only have wished them death,” Mudavadi said. He said the Jubilee administration was reluctant to release money to devolved functions, like health, to retain the money and create avenues for stealing, while sabotaging counties. Mudavadi said Kenyans now know who has been fanning health workers’ instability at the county level. “It is no longer strange that the national government unlawfully retains the procurement function,” he said. Mudavadi said the worst is yet to come.
