Mandera is among the 16 counties in dire need of relief food as the impact of drought continues being felt in many parts of Kenya.Last week, it was estimated that 1.3 million people face starvation with regard to crop failure and the drying up of pasture and water points, especially in Northeastern and at the Coast.Mandera drought coordinator Mohamed Alio told the press in Mandera town that the county is on high alert to prevent loss of lives among more than 500 families in need of relief food.Pastoralists have started moving to Marsabit and Wajir counties in search of water and pasture, he said.The entire county has been affected, with all the six subcounties in dire need of relief food, the coordinator said.The situation will worsen if it does not rain within a month, Alio said.The National Drought Management Authority has drawn up a response plan and presented it to the county government for funding. The county government is yet to respond.NDMA has been providing food to 12 primary and secondary schools to keep children in school. Other initiatives include subsidised school fees and a free feeding programme for schoolchildren. The authority has also been maintaining and servicing water pumping engines.County commissioner Fredrick Shisia said the government began distributing relief food to residents on Monday and will continue doing so until the drought situation stabilises.
