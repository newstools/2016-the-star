Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday said corruption allegations against him are a political witch-hunt.Without directly referring to two criminal cases he faces in court for abuse of office and illegal purchase of vehicles, he said &ldquo;corruption must be fought properly.&rdquo; &ldquo;We need to take corruption head-on, but let&rsquo;s get the right people, not hounding innocents working hard to ensure development,&rdquo; Mutua said.He spoke during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos. The function was presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mutua warned that unless the anti-graft war is objective, &ldquo;the real thieves of public funds will walk scot-free.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will lose the fight,&rdquo; he said. The Court of Appeal last Thursday stopped Mutua&rsquo;s prosecution. Justices GBM Kariuki, Festus Azangalala and ole Kantai granted the order blocking the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from arresting and charging the governor. On September 23, Justice Isaac Lenaola issued orders allowing the DPP to commence a criminal case against Mutua over the purchase of 16 vehicles for county officials.On politics, Mutua said his Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement will work closely with Jubilee at the next polls.&ldquo;Chap Chap will support development and I think we will support you [Uhuru] for a second term,&rdquo; he said. Mutua urged the Ukambani people to reject empty rhetoric from selfish leaders. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want politics of poverty of one or two people,&rdquo; he said.
