Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday said corruption allegations against him are a political witch-hunt.Without directly referring to two criminal cases he faces in court for abuse of office and illegal purchase of vehicles, he said corruption must be fought properly. We need to take corruption head-on, but let s get the right people, not hounding innocents working hard to ensure development, Mutua said.He spoke during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos. The function was presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mutua warned that unless the anti-graft war is objective, the real thieves of public funds will walk scot-free. We will lose the fight, he said. The Court of Appeal last Thursday stopped Mutua s prosecution. Justices GBM Kariuki, Festus Azangalala and ole Kantai granted the order blocking the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from arresting and charging the governor. On September 23, Justice Isaac Lenaola issued orders allowing the DPP to commence a criminal case against Mutua over the purchase of 16 vehicles for county officials.On politics, Mutua said his Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement will work closely with Jubilee at the next polls. Chap Chap will support development and I think we will support you [Uhuru] for a second term, he said. Mutua urged the Ukambani people to reject empty rhetoric from selfish leaders. We don t want politics of poverty of one or two people, he said.
