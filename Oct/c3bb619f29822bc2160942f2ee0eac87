Students of Moi University in Mombasa have threatened to stage protests aftermissing classes for more than a month.Learning was paralysed for the period after lecturers downed their tools citing non-payment.The unpaid lecturers are mostly part timers who form about 90 per cent of the teaching staff at the institution.One of the tutors who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have not received their wages in full since 2014."The lecturers were angered when some of them were paid a paltry Sh4,081 - a figure whose arrival could not be justified by the school," he said."The problem runs deep in other academic departments at the institution. For instance, the School of Education owns lecturers to the tune of millions."The don said they were to be paid Sh1,200 an hour and teach for 39 hours a semester. Each academic year has three semesters.A calculation indicates a single lecturer is supposed to have received Sh421,200 by now, but most of them claim they have not received a quarter of this amount."We will not resume work until our dues are paid," he said.The source added that they were contemplating going to the Ombudsman to force the university to clear the arrears. "The problem with the university is mismanagement. Students have been paying fees. Most of them are graduating and you cannot graduate without clearing fees. We are wondering where the money is going," he said.The Star could not independently verify the claims since efforts to get a response from the institution were futile.
