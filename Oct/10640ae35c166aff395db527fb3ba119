Moi University's Coast campus may be closed indefinitely amid a cash crunch that has seen some lecturers quit, learning paralysed and students protest.Learners staged a demonstration on Wednesday and said they will do so again, on a larger scale, if payments will not have been made by next week.They said only seven out of the seven units for the semester have been taught, six weeks after they returned to school. Others said they have missed lessons for the last month.The students stormed campus director Mwanakombo Mohamed's office. A meeting followed that night and saw the university agree to pay tutors by next Monday.Lecturers were also urged to return to class by Thursday but some said they will only do so if they are paid in full by Friday. They said they have been paid in part since 2014.Some said they were paid a paltry Sh4,081 a semester instead of at least Sh46,800, and noted their arrears amounted to millions of shillings.One underlined they were to be paid Sh1,200 for each of the 39 hours they teach a semester. Each academic year has three semesters.The lecturers accused the government of misappropriating funds and said they will continue to sabotage learning if their arrears are not cleared.They further said the university was not keen on addressing their "grave concerns". I doubt the money will be in our accounts by Friday, one said.Mwanakombo declined to comment saying she was not authorised to do so.Read: Mombasa Moi varsity students threaten demo as lecturers skip classes over pay
