Stop attacking my government, the Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong lashed out at Funyula MP Paul Otuoma during the Seventh Mashujaa Day celebrations. The governor was reacting to the MP s claims that the county government has underperformed. I want to urge my brother Dr Paul Otuoma to stop washing dirty linen in public, said Ojaamong in Funyula Sports Ground on Thursday. If he has any burning issue with my government, he is free to come to my office so we can dialogue over the issues amicably, rather than resorting to wrangles. He made the remarks when Otuoma, who was at the function, engaged him in a bitter war of words, shocking residents.The governor told Otuoma they should iron out their differences away from the public glare. Defending his performance record, Ojaamong said the national government keeps the bulk of taxpayers money and only a small percentage is given to the county, which makes it impossible for him to adequately implement development projects.The governor said his government has been under constant attack from some leaders in Funyula constituency opposed to his leadership, yet the senior officers who serve in his administration come from Samia subcounty.Otuoma has declared his intention to run for governor, and is keen to unseat Ojaamong at next year s election. The two have on numerous occasions been at loggerheads, with Otuoma accusing the governor of doing little for the people. The MP had resigned as ODM vice chairman, but says he did so in an emotional outburst.
