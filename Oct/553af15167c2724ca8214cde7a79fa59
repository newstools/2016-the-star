An MP has challenged the nomination of judge Philomena Mwilu as the next Deputy Chief Justice, claiming she received Sh3 million to dismiss an election petition the legislator had filed.Kandara MP Alice Wahome wrote to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that will vet the nominee.She claims she filed an election petition in 2008 against former Kandara MP Maina Kamau, whom she claims she defeated in the 2007 election. Her integrity, moral character and impartiality do not meet the threshold outlined in the constitution, Wahome said, adding that the matter has never been concluded.In a letter to the Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission, Wahome said she is willing to provide the required information so the commission can investigate the judge.Wahome said Mwilu s approval will be a violation of the Constitution and wants the National Assembly to reject her nomination. She hinted that she may be forced to move to court to block Mwilu s swearing in if she is approved by MPs.
