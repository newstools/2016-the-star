A championship race that appeared to have ebbed away from Gor Mahia five days ago is now back on track after the three-time holders produced master class to defeat eternal rivals AFC Leopards 2-0 in a surprisingly one-sided clash at Nyayo Stadium yesterday.The three points for Gor coupled with Sportpesa Premier League leaders and favourites Tuskers 1-1 draw at home to relegation-threatened Nairobi City Stars means that only four points separate the two contenders with three matches left to conclude the campaign.Meddie Kagere put Gor ahead from the spot in the 65th minute after Eugene Ambulwa foiled his compatriot Jacques Tuyisenge before fans favourite and second half substitute Enock Agwanda confirmed K Ogalo s victory over their nemesis for the first time in three years.Gor now have 50 points while Tusker are on 54 points. Gor with Collins Okoth back in the starting line-up dominated the opening exchanges with Kagere, Tuyisenge and George Odhiambo keeping the Ingwe rear-guard busy. Odhiambo had the first sight of goal but shot straight at Lucas Indeche with Paul Kiongera responding with rasping drive that swerved just wide off Boniface Oluoch s far post.Karim Nizigiyimana then swept in a dangerous cross but Kagere and Tuyisenge were caught on their heels as Leopards survived. Kepha Aswani then got on the end of Edwin Wafula s cross but misdirected his header. Gor then with halftime approaching, nearly took the lead but Tuyisenge fluffed his line.The second half continued with Gor looking increasingly the likelier to score and they got that opportunity just after the hour when Ambulwa ss mistimed tackle left Tuyisenge on the floor, forcing referee George Mwai to award a penalty that Kagere converted. From then on, it looked a long way back for Leopards and substitute Agwanda made sure there was no slip up for the champions scoring with thumping effort in the 80th minute.The win was made even sweeter by Tusker s surprise stalemate against bottom of the table City Stars. The brewers had seemed destined for routine win when Anthony Ndolo gave them a 35th minute lead but Robert Ndungu s strike in the 64th minute made them wait a while longer before they can think of popping the champagne.Long shot title aspirations of Chemelil Sugar and Western Stima were snuffed out as they endured frustrating home draws. Chemelil needed a second half goal from JamesOmino to cancel out Joseph Mbugi s penalty in their 2-1 draw.Stima too were on the end of similar score-line as Wesley Kemboi nullified John Kagi s opener for Ulinzi Stars. Thika United ensured Ushuru remain in danger of being dragged into the relegation dogfight as they beat them 1-0.
