The Kakamega government will build 200km of tarmac roads by next August, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) has said.He said on Wednesday his government has already constructed 20km of bitumen roads in Kakamega and Mumias towns in the first phase. Oparanya said they have built 1,200km of all-weather roads in last three years and have embarked on construction of another 600km. We re focusing on opening up roads because they are critical for the movement of goods and people and to promote trade, he said. The county has a 7,000km road network.Oparanya spoke in Bukura when he launched construction of a market. He inspected development projects in Lurambi constituency. Oparanya said his government is leasing road construction equipment from the national government. He said the work has been slowed by lack of equipment. Oparanya said, however, the county has run out of marrum deposits to maintain and construct roads.He said inadequate funding of devolved governments by the central government has hindered development. Oparanya said the Jubilee administration has been unable to control rampant corruption. Every day, Kenyans wake to a new corruption scandal and the President has openly confessed he is unable to tackle the vice. This leaves us with no option but remove the regime from power, because we cannot continue keeping a thieving government, he said.
