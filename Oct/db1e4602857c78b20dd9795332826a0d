The Swiss firm, awarded the controversial Sh17.8 billion tax management system's contract by the Kenya Revenue Authority, was disqualified by the country&rsquo;s standards body in 2015, it emerged yesterday.The National Assembly&rsquo;s Public Investments Committee questioned why the KRA went ahead to seal the Excisable Goods Management Systems deal with a company that the Kenya Bureau of Standards locked out of a standardization mark tender, for non compliance with the International Organisation for Standardisation standards.This came as directors of SICPA Solutions SA Limited, and its Kenyan subsidiary SICPA Kenya appeared before the committee to shed light on the company&rsquo;s operations and how they secured the deal.&ldquo;In January 2015, your company participated in a similar tender at Kebs and failed to secure the tender. You complained to the Public Procurement Review Board but did not bear any fruits,&rdquo; the committee, chaired by Eldas MP Adan Keynan told one of the directors, Bruno Fentsel.This came even as more questions emerged among them the composition of the board.Two letters from the department of the registrar of companies differed in the number of directors. One had five, while the other had six names of directors.The directors were also quizzed on the company&rsquo;s alleged involvement in corruption in Brazil, high costing of the stamps and the manner in which the deal was sealed.Fentsel Told the committee negotiations were done in a Nairobi. KRA officials never visited the company&rsquo;s offices.The committee said the gazette notice by KRA to implement the Act was never submitted to Parliament by the then minister Njeru Githae and current Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich as required by law.&ldquo;This contract has no basis whatsoever within the law,&rdquo; Keynan said.The Public Procurement Oversight Authority had earlier told MPs that the KRA awarded SICPA Solutions the Excisable Goods Management Systems contract in May 9, 2010, long before the company was registered on May 9, 2013.SICPA&rsquo;s Kenya director Michele Castegnaro told the committee he was not part of the company when the contract was being awarded.The company also said the EGMS tender, which will help the government fight tax fraud and increase taxes &ldquo;was awarded to SICPA following an open international&rdquo;. &ldquo;SICPA has never been convicted of any crime in its subsidiaries,&rdquo; Fentsel told the committee.The committee questioned how the two arrived at the Sh1.50 per stamp payable to the firm by manufacturers of excisable goods in the country.Soft drink maker Coca-Cola said it would close shop and relocate its manufacturing plants to neighbouring countries if the taxman insists on levying the charge.The East Africa Breweries has also opposed the system.,The stamps have already been implemented on cigarettes and spirits. The KRA, however, stopped the implementation on sodas and juices.Githae and Rotich are expected to be called to appear before the committee. Kaynan said the Kebs and KRA management will also be called to shed light.
