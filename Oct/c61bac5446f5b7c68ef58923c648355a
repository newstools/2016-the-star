Pan-African lender Ecobank has partnered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and donated Sh10 million for the agency's programmes in Africa.The two organisations operate in 28 African countries, and through the partnership they aim to reach 430,000 beneficiaries over the next few years. Corporates like Ecobank Group help us to find homegrown solutions to the problem of refugees in Africa. While global humanitarian resources are dwindling, such committed support helps us to plan and implement programmes including ensuring education delivery, and creating and developing business opportunities for refugees and their gracious host communities, said Valentine Tapsoba, UNHCR regional bureau director for Africa.
