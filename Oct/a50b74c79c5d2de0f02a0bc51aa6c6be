Criminals in Nairobi are disguising themselves as vagabonds, street children and destitute people to rob residents in the CBD, Nairobi Jubilee politician Francis Mwangi has said.&ldquo;People are no longer safe. Robberies are happening even during the day,&rdquo; he said.Many residents have been robbed of phones, money and laptops, as the number of street children grows day by day, Mwangi said.&ldquo;They are all over, especially on Tom Mboya Street and Moi Avenue,&rdquo; the businessman said.Nairobi has become a conference hub with many dignitaries visiting, so &ldquo;we should make it clean, safe and secure,&rdquo; the politician said.He urged Governor Evans Kidero and county officials to humanely relocate street families to keep the city clean and safe.The government has set aside funds to rehabilitate the youth, but the county government has failed to control the children, Mwangi said.Kidero has in the past said the county can&rsquo;t be blamed for the presence of the street urchins.
