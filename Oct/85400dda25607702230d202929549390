Embu Governor Martin Wambora and Senator Lenny Kivuti, who are rivals for governor s position, on Thursday held parallel Mashujaa Day celebrations and sought support from residents.The two were joined by different provincial administration teams. Wambora was accompanied by county officials and Embu North subcounty commissioner Musni Abdulatif at the Kairuri Ground, while Kivuti was accompanied by seven MCAs and Embu county commissioner Esther Maina at the Embu University Ground.Most of the people who attended the Kivuti-led celebrations donned red T-shirts and caps printed with the Jubilee Party logo and his picture, while those at the Wambora-led celebrations did not have party attire. Kivuti urged his supporters to shun tribalism, violence, incitement, and insults and avoid disrupting rivals meetings.He urged aspirants and elected leaders to conduct issue-based campaigns to show what they have done and what they plan to do for residents.Kivuti called on politicians to emulate President Uhuru Kenyatta s war on corruption and tribalism, and campaigns for peace, saying these should be devolved to the grassroots. Anybody who sparks violence should be told to step aside, he said, urging residents to elect him because he had done a lot as a senator and will do more. The seven MCAs pledged to support the senator, accusing Wambora of poor governance. Maina told politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns said they will arrest those causing chaos.Wambora said he wants to use the remaining part of his term to deliver on his pledges. He dismissed rumours he will defend his position on the Maendeleo Chap Chap Party ticket.Wambora blamed it on his rivals, whom he accused of trying to sabotage his re-election. He said he is in JP and will square off with rivals in nominations. He warned his opponents to brace for a bruising battle, as he is ready to defend the seat.
