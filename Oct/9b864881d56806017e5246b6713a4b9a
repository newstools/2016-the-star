The matatu driver who allegedly attempted to drug and steal from his passengers on Saturday is set to appear in court.Passenger Karimi Mwari took to Facebook with an account of what happened to her in the Dakika Sacco vehicle registration number KAS253V.Kilimani OCPD Peter Katam told the Star by phone on Monday that the incident was reported under OB71/22/10/16."He will be charged with the offence of robbing and intending to drug passengers," he said.Noting cases of attacks in PSVs have been on the rise, Katam praised Mwari for exposing her attackers.&ldquo;We congratulate her for the courage to report this particular incident to us. We recovered and detained the vehicle she boarded," he said.Mwari said she sat at the front with the driver, knowing this to be a precautionary measure by many Nairobi residents.But she said the driver grabbed her handbag and started pulling when she tried to alight at the stage outside Kenyatta National Hospital."They started pushing me and roughing me up while another dropped keys inside my shirt to disrupt me," she recounted. "I ignored them and tussle with the driver who I notice is now holding a syringe right next to my rib cage."The woman said that in defence, she thrust her bag at the driver and hit his nose causing him to bleed. "That's when I notice my bag is open and with it my phone, cash payments from a client and cards," she wrote.Mwari said more men gathered around her and tried to stop her from taking pictures.She said she then noticed that two other women in the vehicle seemed unconscious.She said she started shouting but that her voice was drowned by men asking her to ignore the incident.The woman said she escaped and ran across the road to the hospital, where she called a friend and found her way to a police station.But at the police station Mwari waited two hours as officers were handling other cases and were preparing to change shifts.She said the first officer she encountered was helpful but that another, reportedly in charge of traffic, did not seem to care."After I give my ordeal he looks at me seemingly unperturbed. I explain to him that I need to know the girls are fine. His response was 'are you related to the''" she said.She said she explained why she was concerned but that the policeman dismissed her and continued chatting with other people.Mwari said she was told in Kiswahili: "Kama umereport enda zako. Hio ingine si shauri yako (If you have reported the case, go away. The other matter does not concern us)."But she said she returned to the reporting desk where an officer told her he would help.Mwari said she believed a cartel was drugging and raping passengers, and that matatus were no longer safe.Officers have often been accused of colluding with matatu drivers to escape punishments for the offences they commit.The OCPD said the police officers Mwari mentioned in her account were yet to be found."We still do not know where they are are this particular moment," he said, but noted investigations were ongoing.
