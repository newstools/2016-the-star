Central Kenya will unconditionally support Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s 2022 presidential bid, Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki has said.He said Ruto deserves total support from the Mt Kenya region since he has worked cordially with President Uhuru Kenyatta to promote peaceful coexistence.&ldquo;We will vote for Ruto without a doubt when the time comes. No one should bring any intrigues about it. It will be our way of showing gratitude for supporting Uhuru for two terms,&rdquo; the senator from Tharaka Nithi said.Kindiki hinted, however, that Ruto&rsquo;s running mate should come from the region, a matter he said is subject to negotiation. Definitely support him&ldquo;Our working relations with our brothers from the Rift Valley and the country at large will be maintained for we will seek to be part of the Ruto-led government. Thus, we will sit and decide who will be best suited to deputise Ruto,&rdquo; he said. Kindiki spoke on Saturday in Thika during a fundraiser for the family of Thika Town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s aide Eliud Gathangira, who died in a road accident last week. Gathangira has left behind a widow and two young children. The MPs present paid glowing tribute to him. MP Esther Gathogo said, &ldquo;We shall hold discussions on the other political seats, but we shall definitely support Ruto for president in 2022.&rdquo; She dismissed as baseless the notion that people from the Mt Kenya region can only vote for one of their own. About three months ago, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said the people of Central will not automatically support Ruto to succeed Uhuru, but he recanted the statement. The MPs present at the fundraiser were Kiambu&rsquo;s Jude Njomo, Ferdinand Waititu of Kabete and Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a.
