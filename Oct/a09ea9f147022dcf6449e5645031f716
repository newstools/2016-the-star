Naivasha residents woke up to the shocking site of 19 bodies exhumed by Hyenas at a public cemetery next to Longonot national park.They gave the state a two-day ultimatum to inter the bodies, which were disposed in the area last week, afresh or face legal suits. Some of the bodies were buried after they had started decomposing, to the anger of area residents who had to keep up with the foul smell.Area MCA Samuel Waithuki said the animals could have exhumed the bodies since they were disposed in a shallow grave.He promised to follow up the issue with the necessary arms of the government so that action could be taken against the officers involved in the shoddy work."We understand that uncollected bodies have to be disposed but we are concerned with the manner that the same was carried out," Waithuki said. Paul Kimani, an elder from the area, said that the animals had a field day feasting on the bodies before area residents intervened."The wild animals carried away part of the bodies some of which were spotted near homesteads. We want the county government to relocate this cemetery," he said.On his part, Benjamin Kamau -a youth leader - said that the smell could be perceived at a nearby police station, a church, health center and tens of homes.He noted that some of the bodies could be seen protruding from the shallow grave."We fear that when it rains the soil covering the bodies could be washed away exposing area residents to all manner of diseases," he said."This is very shameful and we are challenging the county government to address the crisis around cemeteries in Naivasha," Stephen Mungai, a resident, said.A senior public health officer who declined to be named downplayed the crisis, saying that the bodies were disposed in the right manner.
