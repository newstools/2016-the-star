Meru Governor Peter Munya has urged the youth to apply for loans from saccos and invest in their businesses.He spoke during a youth summit in Igembe Central constituency on Saturday. Munya said, You can borrow the loans once you have saved and thereafter continue paying. It is payable at an interest rate of five per cent only. There is no other sacco which gives loans at that rate. Each sacco is given Sh67 million every year, he said.Munya urged the youth to avoid idleness. Stop waiting to get free items. Free things never do anything for you. If you are not aggressive, you cannot succeed in business. Don t start a business just because someone else started one, he said.
