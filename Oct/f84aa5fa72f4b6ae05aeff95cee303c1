Opposition leader Raila Odinga has made allegations of another fleecing syndicate believed to have ripped off Kenyans of Sh162 billion in the last three years.The funds are said to be from revenue collection on import goods.Raila said on Saturday that a company called SKIP from Switzerland, commissioned to check counterfeit and quality of import goods, has been taking Sh1.5 million of revenue, translating to Sh120 million daily."The same company is under investigation in Brazil, flaws that forced Brazilian legislators to impeach [former President Dilma Rousseff]," he said.But Raila did not provide specific details or documentation on the allegations.He said it is shocking to see the Jubilee administration protect such companies and individuals aimed at ensuring the country's pot is dry.More on this: We got Sh41 million health tender legally - Uhuru cousin"I advised [President Uhuru Kenyatta] two days ago to do what [Rwanda President Paul] Kagame did: he arrested his own brother," he said."Uhuru should arrest anyone mentioned in corruption pacts instead of wasting time with investigations when the auditor already had evidence," the opposition chief added.Nominated MP Oburu Odinga said the country cannot manage to lose Sh4.5 billion per month to a 'dubious' company under Uhuru's watch."We have institutions like Kenya Counterfeit Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards that are supposed to carry out the job SKIP company," he said.The MP also accused the government of making it difficult for the Public Accounts Committee to produce reports touching on losses of large sums of money by the State.He also accused the media of not highlighted some of the major financial scandals despite being briefed on time in a bid to save taxpayers' money.The opposition leaders were speaking at a rally in Dadra village in Ugenya.Among those present were Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Senator James Orengo, MPs David Ochieng (Ugenya) and Opiyo Wandyi (Ugunja).Others were Ombudsman Otiende Amollo and Nairobi police spokesman Charles Owino.The allegations come hot on the heels of alleged theft of Sh5.3 billion in the Health ministry.The 'Mafia House' scandal also implicated Uhuru's cousin and sister and led to outrage among Kenyans over the escalating scale of corruption.
