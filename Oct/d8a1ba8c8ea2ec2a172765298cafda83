Cotu has called for the disbandment of the government advertising agency and an audit conducted to establish how it has spent funds since inception.In a statement on Wednesday, secretary general Francis Atwoli claimed that certain individuals, both inside and outside government, are using the agency to spend government cash on purposes outside the agency s jurisdiction.The Central Organization of Trade Unions is already privy to the ongoings at the agency, adding that they fear that monies owed to the advertisers have been swindled. "Kenyans will soon be treated to yet another scam where government will be forced to pay millions of money to various advertisers," Atwoli said.He claimed that arrears owed to the advertisers, including newspapers, had already been released through the agency but never reached the advertisers.Atwoli acknowledged that the establishment of the agency was a noble decision as the booking, budgeting, costing and advert placement across the different departments and ministries would promote uniformity and save the government unnecessary costs. "The agency has however since been invaded by corruption thirsty individuals masquerading in the name of government to solicit bribes as well as divert the very cash meant for advertising into their pockets," he said. He said the Auditor General should not just be fooled to bypass the agency and only go after ministries that have been directly advertising with GAA. "He should establish whether the huge sums of money being channeled through GAA are reaching the intended firms and if there are any chances of such funds being diverted, and for which concerns have been raised, let those involved be reprimanded," the Cotu boss said.
