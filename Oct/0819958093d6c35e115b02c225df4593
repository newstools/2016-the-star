Royal Orchid, the Indian-owned growth-hungry hotel chain, will open a Sh150 million luxurious five-star hotel near Kenya&rsquo;s Maasai Mara National Reserve in December. The 60-bed capacity Mara Azure is located near Talek River, and will comprise of 12 luxury tents, five-star cottages and conference facilities. The owners said the Mara Azure will help Royal Orchid retain clients in its Nairobi facility, who prefer other hotels in the Mara for safari tourism. &ldquo;We have been losing guests to rivals when our guests opt to have Safari experience in the Mara. The new development will be a circuit that guests rotate through, either coming from Nairobi, Mombasa or Amboseli,&rdquo; Hotel Royal Orchid Azure chairman Parbat Pindora said. &ldquo;The development on 25 acres is strategically located in that it does not fall into the Mara National Reserve.&rdquo;He said the plan is to have guests view wild animals from their rooms.
