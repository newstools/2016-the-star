Tourism CS Najib Balala has urged politicians to avoid negative rhetoric and to stop undermining the IEBC s ability to deliver credible elections. He said the country risks a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence.Balala spoke at Ucekeeini Primary School in Gatundu South constituency on Wednesday when he presented 48 laptops from the ICT ministry. He was accompanied by Tourism PS Fatuma Hirsi, Kiambu Education executive Esther Ndirangu and acting KICC CEO Nana Gecaga.Balala said reckless talk by politicians will hurt the economic gains made in the last eight years. Let us not talk about elections lightly or try to speak so badly about an institution that we ourselves have built. We remember what was seen in 2008 with the loss of many lives. Do we want to go back there? he said.
