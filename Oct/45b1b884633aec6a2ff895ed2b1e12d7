Drought and famine continue to ravage the people of Samburu even as maize meant for relief lies at the Maralal Cereals board depot.The county government had earlier announced that starving families in the northern and eastern parts of Samburu County will start receiving relief food.But dispatch and distribution teams have not been able to deliver the aid to any needy persons.A total of 10,000 bags of maize meant for relief have already been received at the Maralal National Cereals Board Depot.The maize is part of 20,000 bags expected to be brought at the depot for emergency food security back up.The Sh11 million stock is said to be an order made by the County government of Samburu through the Cereals Board.Sammy Kipng'etich, Depot Manager Maralal office on Thursday said that the maize arrived two weeks ago from Eldoret."We are only waiting for the county to prepare their logistics and come to collect the maize," he said.The board is also re-packaging the maize into 50 kilogramme bags as it waits for the distribution and famine monitoring teams to come and collect.Kipng'etich said that officers from the Health Department Samburu County visited the depot to inspect the maize to ascertain if it is suitable for human consumption. The county government is said to be planning to start the distribution of relief food to the affected families anytime from today.The relief food will be distributed in Wamba and Baragoi areas since they are the most affected parts.Four weeks ago, the National Drought Management Authority in collaboration with the county government had assessed the drought situation and said that approximately 54,000 residents were at risk of being affected.A week ago during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town, Samburu County Commissioner Mohamed Birik assured residents that the National Government had sent emergency relief food to Samburu.More on this: Giving relief food won t end hunger, CS Kiunjuri toldHe said a total of 600 bags of maize, 300 bags of rice 300 bags of beans and 150 cartons of cooking oil had already been received in the county.Families have resorted to sleeping along the roads with the hope that they will see a vehicle delivering relief food.A number of locals have opted to comb through the thorny thickets and bushes in search of wild fruits and tree seeds for food, the same they use to feed their livestock.Villages are deserted as most families have moved with their livestock to neighboring counties of Isiolo and Laikipia in search of water and pasture."As you drive along the Wamba Maralal road and Isiolo Wamba road you will notice a lot of malnourished women on shrubs trying to get wild fruits and seeds, this is all what they can afford to eat," said Chrystone Murungi, Samburu east deputy county commissioner.Read: Dado dispatches Sh160 million relief food for Tana River drought victims
