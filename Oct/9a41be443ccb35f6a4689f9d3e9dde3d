Deputy President William Ruto has reiterated that the government will not allow a recurrence of cattle rustling in Kerio Valley, Baringo and West Pokot Counties.The DP assured residents that additional security officers have been deployed in the valley, including 3,200 Kenya Police Reservists (KPR) new recruits to reinforce the war on cattle rustling.&ldquo;It is pointless to have police officers in shopping centers while criminals are attacking people from known valleys. Police must be stationed where criminals are coming from,&rdquo; Ruto said.He told the police to arrest those terrorizing wananchi along the valley saying they were known to the people.&ldquo;How come residents in the area know cattle rustlers by name and yet no arrests are made?&rsquo; he asked.Ruto put cattle rustlers on notice saying the government will deal ruthlessly with anyone found engaging in the retrogressive practice that is the cause of insecurity among the pastoralists.Leaders who attended the meeting held at Tot World Vision grounds in Marakwet East Constituency included Internal Security Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaisery, MPs John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), David Bowen (Marakwet East), Susan Chebet (Elgeyo Marakwet), Lati Lelelit (Samburu East), Philip Rotino (Sigor) and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett.Others were Governors Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), Moses Lelnokulal (Samburu), Simon Kachapin (West Pokot) Benjamin Cheboi (Baringo) and former MP Linah Jebiii Kilimo.Read:&nbsp;Break your silence on bandit attacks at Kerio Valley, Raila tells Uhuru
