Residents can now only use Manyanja or Kagundo road to go to their homes."There has never been a problem between us and the soldiers. We were surprised to wake up this morning to find the road had been blocked," one said.The KDF is yet to issue a statement on the reasons for the closure of the road which links Mihango and Kayole. It was established in 1999 as the only link between the two villages.But Kados said by phone from Embakasi police station that officers had been notified of the protest."We notified them on time. It's unfair to arrest us yet we have a right to protest against the barbaric actions of KDF," he said.He noted the Kenya Defence Forces dug a trench right across the road leaving residents without an alternative.Area MP John Omondi said the destruction of the road was in bad faith and would trigger animosity between residents and soldiers."I have asked the military chief and the county government to intervene. They have agreed to look into the matter. We should not breed animosity between soldiers and civilians," he said.Also read: Embakasi residents ask NLC to intervene as Health centre, Chiefs camp grabbed
