President Uhuru Kenyatta’s surrender in the war on graft is reason enough to vote him out, Cord co-principal Moses Wetang’ula (pictured) has said. The President, during the Anti-Corruption and Governance State House Summit last week, expressed his frustration in fighting graft. Wetang’ula said Uhuru indicated he has surrended. He said the President needs to be sincere in the war on corruption. Uhuru should take full responsibility in fighting graft and ensure he does not spare anybody, Wetang’ula said. “Let the President take firm action on the ‘big fish’ of corruption, starting with his senior government officials. If he is defeated then his political obituary is written,” Wetang’ula said. He said Uhuru has failed to deliver his election promises and has lost the ability to fight tribalism. Cord will take the mantle and bring the desired change, Wetang’ula said. He assured Kenyans the Cord co-principals – Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and himself – will remain united. “Those who thought the coalition is headed for a breakup are daydreaming. I assure you the unity of the coalition is vital ahead of the election,” Wetang’ula said. He said the coalition welcomes ANC and other political parties that have shown interest in working with Cord. “We fully welcome Martha Karua, Musalia Mudavadi, Gideon Moi and saac Rutto of CCM,” he said.
