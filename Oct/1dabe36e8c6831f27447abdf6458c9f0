Governors want an impeachment procedure similar to that of the president, as they are all "elected by the people".Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya further noted that motions against Governors have been messy, hence the need for a bill to address loopholes."This will see justice done for a governor being impeached," he said on Thursday when Eldas MP Adan Keynan proposed Impeachment Procedure Bill 2016.It provides an overall framework for removing public officers including the President, DP, cabinet secretaries, governors, deputy governors and county executives.Keynan, who wants the County Government Act amended, said the Bill will protect office holders from politically instigated schemes to remove them from office.More on this: Amend act to strip MCAs of powers to impeach governors, Ndathi saysIf passed by the National Assembly and Senate, people may petition either House for the removal of a governor on grounds provided under the constitution.The petition will be submitted to the clerk of the relevant House or through an MP on their behalf, with the Speaker's consent.Upon determining the petition's validity, the Speaker will form a special committee to probe the matter. The committee will then report to the relevant House on whether it will find substantial grounds for a governor to be impeached.The Bill gives effect to Article 96 section one of the constitution, which empowers the Senate to protect the interests of counties.It also reinforces Article 181 section two, which empowers Parliament to enact legislation providing for the procedure of removal of a governor.This comes after concern among governors that MCAs have been targeting county bosses for selfish gain.Read: Council of governors to sue over Gachagua's impeachment, says Munya
