Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi s spokesman Kibisu Kabatesi on Tuesday dismissed nominated MP Patrick Wangamati as an impediment to the Luhya's quest for presidency.He said that Wangamati's claim that Mudavadi was a Jubilee mole was meant to divert attention from the tribulations his Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula is facing."We caution the Ford-K leader that Wangamati is an agent tasked with stalking him. Wangamati is good at stage-managing feuds and then pretending to be solving them," Kabatesi said."The current rebellion in Ford-K is typical of Wangamati handwork," Kabatesi said in a statement.He said that Wangamati s tirade against Mudavadi shows 'political senility' as he isn t up-to-date with recent political developments.Wangamati on Wednesday said Mudavadi cannot be trusted to join Cord because "he is being used by the Jubilee Party to cause divisions""How can you join our house and start dictating to us that you want to be the Cord presidential candidate? That is outrageous and beats logic. If you want to join us, wait for direction," he said.Read: Mudavadi is a Jubilee mole MPBut Kabatesi said that it is a known fact that the Luhya Council of Elders Wangamati heads is a "discrepant guns for hire outfit" strategically created to mislead Luhya leaders on the presidency.He added that Wangamati lacks and cannot pass the credibility and integrity test to pretend to be an elder and advisor on political matters.Kabatesi challenged Wangamati and his forum to first account for the money invested in the stillborn Mulembe Investment Bank. He further accused the nominated MP for being behind the ongoing internal wrangles in Ford Kenya pitting Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and his Tongaren counterpart Eseli Simiyu.The two had an ugly confrontation in Kitale over party primaries which resulted into a fist-fight.Read: MPs Eseli, Wamalwa fight in Kitale hotel over direct Ford-K party ticket claimLast week, Wamalwa was endorsed by some party officials for the governor s seat, currently held by Patrick Khaemba - also of Ford Kenya.
