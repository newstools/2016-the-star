Kenya secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) face a serious constitutional crisis after it was directed to order for fresh elections by the Ministry of Education.This follows the decision by the ministry to establish regional coordinators of education for eight regions aimed at strengthening education at county level hence effective and efficient service delivery. In a circular to regional coordinators of education, Leah K Rotich of the Education Ministry said the establishment of the regional co-ordinators, has necessitated the realignment of the sports committees. Following the establishment of regional coordinators, the sports committees must also be realigned to official regions as established by the ministry, Rotich, who signed the circular for the principal secretary, said. This she says will therefore require the election of officials in all the co-curricular activities from the sub-county to the national level.This means that KSSSA who changed their rules to allow them to be in office for five years and were due for polls next year, will be expected to go to polls before their five-year term elapses. When contacted, the KSSSA deputy secretary, Robert Mukhwana, said they were consulting wildly before making a decision next week. As you may have seen these are directives that we need to follow but we are planning for a meeting with the ministry officials and it s then that we will be able to give a detailed report, he said.Regions mostly affected are Mau region, Metro region, Nothern and Nzoia. The regions are likely to lose some counties with the re-alignment.
