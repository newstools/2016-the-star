Some 45 casual labourers at the Embu Hospital Level 5 Hospital on Monday went on strike to demand three months salaries arrears.They say Neru Ltd, which has been contracted by the government to provide services at the hospital, owes them a total of Sh945,000.On Tuesday, workers Michael Mureithi and Mary Kagendo told the Star their efforts to seek audience with the company management to have their salaries wired to their banks have been unsuccessful.The workers are hired to clean, feed the patients and look after the general maintenance of the hospital.They said they will only resume duty after their salaries are paid.They said their houses have been locked up by the landlords, as they are unable to pay rent and their children have been expelled from schools over fees arrears.Mureithi workers said they have endured for three months without salaries for the sake of patients, but the situation has become unbearable.Medical superintendent Dr Henry Njiru on Tuesday said the casual labourers risk losing their jobs for participating in the strike.He said they are not employees of the county government and the hospital will engage the services of others if the strike continues.Njiru said the workers are hired by Neru Ltd and it's the company's responsibility to pay them.
