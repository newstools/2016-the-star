Makueni deputy governor Adelina Mwau will on Friday give out Sh68 million in loans to 600 welfare groups in the county.Mwau said the selected groups from 30 wards will each get between Sh50,000 and Sh200, 000 to boost their economic activities.The groups were vetted after applying for the loans to ensure they are suitable for the award of the loans.The groups will receive cheques at Matiliku in Makueni sub-county in a function to be attended by governor Kivutha Kibwana and several women deputy governors.Kisumu deputy governor Ruth Odinga, Kitui's Peninah Malonza and Embu's Dorothy Nditi will be gracing the occasion.The beneficiaries are mainly women and youth groups.Mwau said the county has set aside Sh134 million to fund youth and women enterprises to enable them boost their economic activities and uplift the county's economy."We have allocated Sh4 million to every ward. We have discovered that many groups have become dormant. The county will begin a process of registering them to ensure they all meet the requirements so that they are not left out," Mwau said.The DG said the Kenya Women Finance Trust loans remain largely inaccessible to many rural women because of bureaucracy and rigid requirements.She said the loans will be paid without any interests. The kitty will only retain three percent of the amount loaned to every group for administrative use and the beneficiaries will have three month grace period before starting payments. They will be required to repay the loans in a year."We want to turn the merry-go-rounds and table banking to viable economic ventures to uplift women's lives by helping them to earn a living and be self-dependent," she said.Mwau spoke to the Star at the Safari Park Hotel, Nairobi, where she had led women deputy governors to a workshop on strategic leadership.She wants the women aspiring for elective seats to craft campaign strategy to give them an upper hand in the elections.Read: Makueni to start bank for county chamas
