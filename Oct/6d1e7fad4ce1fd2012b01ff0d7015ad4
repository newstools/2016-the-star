Kenya Defence Forces chances of toppling perennial rivals Police in today s SportPesa national boxing league in Nakuru have been dealt a major blow with the absence of three of their key international boxers.Lightweight Olympian Nick Okoth, who has been away on medical grounds, will be the notable absentee in the army side. Also away for training are international boxers Simon Mulinge (flyweight) and light welterweight Victor Odhiambo. I haven t been feeling very well over the past few weeks and as such can t make it to the Nakuru event, said Okoth, who represented Kenya at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Okoth, who is the younger brother of Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games silver medalist Absalom Diblo Okinyi, hopes to resume his position in the KDF outfit next season.KDF coached by former Kenya flyweight Sammy Magima defeated Police in the third leg in Thika with a full strength side and are hoping for a repeat performance despite not fielding their top boxers. I think the absence of Okoth has weakened the KDF side even more and I believe they stand no chance against Police. It will be a walk in the park for the Police side, Musa Benjamin, a former Kenya junior team coach said.In a rare occurrence at Machakos penultimate leg, Police qualified all their 10 boxers to the finals and coach George Forman Onyango believes there will be no stopping his boys from retaining the coveted title. We believe we will come out victorious again. We have been training really hard and we are leaving nothing to chance, said Onyango.Raphael Mutua will replace Okoth at lightweight division while Steve Onyango will stand in for Onyango at light welterweight. KDF will field bantamweight Isaac Meja, Super heavyweight Fred Ramogi, former Kenya welterweight international Black Moses Mathenge and light heavyweight Hezrone Maganga.Meanwhile, Boxer of the Year prize giving will coincide with the fifth leg of the national league closing ceremony.The closing ceremony will be held at the same venue at 2pm on Saturday and will be graced by ministry of Sports Cabinet Secretary, Hassan Wario Arero and Sportpesa CEO, Ronald Karauri.
