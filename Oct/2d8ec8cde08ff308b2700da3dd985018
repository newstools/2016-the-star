The Jubilee Party leadership in Mombasa has threatened to crack the whip on rogue members as it begins to lay the ground rules for campaigns. The initiative, spearheaded by Suleiman Shahbal, is aimed at instilling discipline to avoid embarrassing party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta and harming his chances of reelection, sources said.This is after the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Tononoka Grounds on Thursday, where two groups of Jubilee and Cord women heckled each other. Insiders said a meeting was held right after the celebrations to discuss the conduct of the Jubilee women. The heckling did not please the Jubilee leaders in Mombasa, especially Shahbal. He is the one who called for a serious meeting and came up with the idea of laying some ground rules, a source said.Mombasa Governor aspirant Ananiah Mwaboza on Friday said they want to instil discipline. In politics, the most organised and disciplined parties are usually more successful. What we saw in Tononoka was not the best picture we want to create, he told the Star in an interview.There are two groups of Jubilee women operating in Mombasa, Warembo na UhuRuto and Warembo na Uhuru. The two are fighting for recognition. It is the Warembo na Uhuru group that was responsible for the heckling at the Mashujaa Day celebrations. However, on Saturday, leaders of the two groups sounded a reconciliatory note at a Warembo na UhuRuto Mombasa rally at the Star of the Sea Hall.
