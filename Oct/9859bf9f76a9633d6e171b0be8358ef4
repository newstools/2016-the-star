The MCA sponsoring the motion to impeach Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has disowned a letter stating he had withdrawn it.Samuel Nyangwara (Viwandani) said he would &ldquo;never dream&rdquo; of withdrawing the motion and accused unnamed people of forging his signature.&ldquo;I cannot be so stupid as to withdraw a motion that has already been suspended. I assure you, even if I remain alone, this motion must be debated,&rdquo; he said yesterday.A withdrawal letter addressed to speaker Alex Magelo has been doing the rounds on social media since Saturday.Magelo said he found the letter on his desk yesterday morning and referred it to the clerk. &ldquo;I was told the letter was brought here by honourable Mark Ndung&rsquo;u. I took it to the clerk because there is no way I can approve a letter to withdraw a motion that I have already suspended,&rdquo; he said.Magelo said Nyangwara was in Mombasa at the time the letter was purportedly written. Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Ndung&rsquo;u declined to confirm or deny dropping the letter at the speaker&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk now. Please let&rsquo;s talk tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.The speaker suspended the debate on the motion on Wednesday following a court order obtained by Kidero on Monday, barring the debate until the case is heard.The High Court order also prohibited the assembly from summoning the governor to defend himself against the accusations in the motion. Magelo had on October 5 summoned Kidero to appear before the MCAs to defend himself.Nyangwara had accused Kidero of incompetence, lack of leadership skills and violating procurement laws.Last Tuesday, the session to debate the motion was adjourned after the house failed to raise a quorum.
