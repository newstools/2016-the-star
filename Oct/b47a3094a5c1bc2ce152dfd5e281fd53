Two MPs from Garissa county have urged Knec to ensure students sit their national exams in their respective schools.Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye and his Dadaab counterpart Mohamed Dahiye told the Kenya National Examinations Council not to move students to other centres.They addressed the press yesterday after a funds drive in Garissa. Shidiye urged Knec to allow the students to sit the exams where they registered. Shidiye said some centres, especially those on the border, have been closed by the government and students told they would be moved to other centers.The move, he said, will place the students at a disadvantage. The government has explained that the move was informed by insecurity yet wananchi are going about their business in the same areas, Shidiye said.He added, When the ministry moves students they will require shelter, food and transport. They are moving away from their parents, which will automatically destabilise them. Dahiye told the exam agency in northern Kenya the distance is far and wide and the terrain is harsh.If it rains it would be difficult for the students to go back home or to school.Their call comes barely two days after Knut Garissa branch officials urged the state to use helicopters to transport exam papers directly from the headquarters to the exam centres since the containers provided by the exam agency are too few.Dahiye said their pleas to the authorities to have adequate containers were ignored.In January, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale praised teachers and candidates from Northeastern for posting good results in KCPE exams despite a huge teacher shortage.In July last year, no meaningful learning went on, following a spate of terror attacks.
