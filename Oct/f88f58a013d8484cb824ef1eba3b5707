Mumias leaders have asked the Mumias Sugar Company management to explain how Sh3 billion in bailout funds from the government was used.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali and former ODM youth leader Rashid Mohammed said the money, meant to pay farmers, was mismanaged by managing director Eroll Johnson and board chairman Dan Ameyo.Mohammed demanded that the two pay outstanding farmers arrears in two weeks or vacate office, failing which he will lead farmers in protests to eject them from office. Up to this time, farmers who delivered cane in 2012 are still claiming their dues from Mumias. Where did this money go? Mohammed said.Washiali spoke during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mumias East subcounty headquarters, while Mohammed was in Nabongo grounds on Thursday.Mohammed said the MSC is the only cash cow in the county, and they will not allow residents to watch it go under. He accused Ameyo and Johnson of failing to turn around the company. Washiali said the bailout was not for paying contractors and suppliers, and neither was it to be spent to fund trips for MSC s managers and board members.
