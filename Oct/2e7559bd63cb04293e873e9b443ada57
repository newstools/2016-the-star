President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged Sh9 million to revive the Akamba handicraft industry to win the votes of the Kamba community in Mombasa.This comes as rebel Wiper MPs from the Kamba want their community to support Jubilee in the traditional opposition zone. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery on Tuesday said the opposition is leading the Kamba community into the desert.He spoke at the Akamba handicraft industry in Changamwe. Wiper rebels Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), businessman Daniel Muange and Jubilee politician Philip Ndolo said the community is better placed being in the government than in the opposition.The Kamba in Mombasa hold more than 45,000 votes. Muange, who is eyeing the Changamwe parliamentary seat, and Ndolo promised to ensure the votes go to Jubilee next year. We are tired of being used to place people in positions, only to be left high and dry, Muange said.Uhuru is targeting the 45,000 votes to check Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho s chances of re-election.Nkaissery delivered Uhuru s Sh3 million contribution towards reviving the industry, which collapsed during the 1997 Kaya Bombo clashes in Mombasa. Uhuru said when he comes here in December and March, he will bring another Sh6 million, the CS said. The 2007-08 post-election violence and terrorist attacks in 2013 and 2014 also damaged the industry.Nkaissery asked Akamba Handicraft Industry chairman Harrison Kitala to organise a harambee in November, when he and five government representatives will contribute generously. By March contributions will total Sh10 million, he said.
