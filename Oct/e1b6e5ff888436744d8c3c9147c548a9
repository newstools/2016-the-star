A former senior Ministry of Education official accused of falsifying documents that led to the loss of Sh8.5 million for a deworming programme for primary school children has been acquitted.Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Doreen Molekyo said the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Margaret Ndanyi stole the funds in 2009.Molekyo acquitted Ndanyi under section 215 of criminal procedure code which allows a court to set free an accused person without putting her on defence. An acquittal does not mean public funds were not lost, but rather it is an indictment of the decision to charge the accused because the evidence fell short of the threshold required in criminal cases, she said.The former head of the health and nutrition unit in the ministry had been accused of providing false receipts to justify spending.The money is alleged to have been allocated to her department to finance a deworming programmes in schools.She allegedly received the money on March 31, 2009 to finance the deworming programme in Coast, Western Nyanza Eastern and Central provinces.
