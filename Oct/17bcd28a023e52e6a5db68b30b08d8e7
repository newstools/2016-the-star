Police in Homa Bay disrupted an "illegal" meeting between a group of contractors and Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga in a hotel in Homa Bay Town constituency on Friday.Area police boss Esau Ochorokodi said the station was not notified about the meeting.Kenya is approaching an elections year and a meeting of such magnitude needs to be secured, he said.The unity talks were called by the contractors to discuss how they would approach the county government to pay them the more than Sh600 million debt accumulated since 2013.The Homa Bay County Contractors Association meeting was attended by at least 40 members.It was stopped a few minutes after Magwanga, who wants to run for governor, arrived.But Magwanga dismissed the police and instead accused Homa Bay leadership using police to intimidate those who demand their rights.He told the county government to pay contractors their money.Association acting chairman Collins Omito and secretary Pamela Onyango said they wanted to discuss how they will demand pay from the Homa Bay government. We met to refute claims that we ve been paid all our dues and seek the best approach to get our long standing dues, Omito said.They accused the police of interrupting a peaceful meeting and said they will schedule another one.They denied the meeting was political and absolved the Kasipul MP from the blame of being part of the team.Onyango said, Projects we started have stalled since suppliers have refused to provide us with construction materials. Our properties might be auctioned. She said police arrested her and two colleagues. Magwanga and his team later marched with the contractors in the streets of Homa Bay town before addressing a gathering at Posta Grounds.
