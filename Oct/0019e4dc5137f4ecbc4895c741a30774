Former Lands CS Charity Ngilu has said she is considering joining Cord.&ldquo;The most important thing in this country is how we are going to develop it, we have talked about poverty for a very long time. We cannot forever continue talking about poverty and suffering of citizens,&rdquo; she said during the burial of CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s husband Henry Oduwole in Mavoko Sub County on Friday.Ngilu was responding to Cord co-principals' invitation.Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) said the fact that they attended the burial together shows there is no discord in Cord "as propagated by Jubilee leaders and the media".Raila said, &ldquo;We will work with women to unite this country and do away with mediocre ethnicity. We are united as co-principals and the coalition is strong. Jubilee leaders are using media to propagate propaganda that there is discord in the opposition.&rdquo; He said all the principals have numbers and the coalition is like River Nile.
