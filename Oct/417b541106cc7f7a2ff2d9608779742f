The Political Parties Disputes Resolution Tribunal has reinstated Masinga Central MCA Joshua Mwonga as Machakos majority leader.Muvuti MCA Timothy Kilonzo has been also reinstated as majority whip pending the determination of an application filed by the two before the tribunal.In orders communicated to the assembly by speaker Bernard Mung ata on Wednesday evening, the tribunal granted an interim injunction suspending a resolution by Cord on October 24.Seventeen out of the 32 Cord MCAs signed for the removal of Mwonga and Kilonzo, a decision which had been communicated in the assembly on October 25.The MCAs replaced Mwonga with Kivaa MCA Alexander Kathinzi, while Gideon Kavuu of Mumbuni North replaced Kilonzo.The tribunal ordered that the application by the complainants be served immediately for interparty hearing on November 10.The MCAs who signed the petition to remove the two said they will respect the tribunal's decision but warned it is a decision on the wrong footing. If Mwonga had a complain on his removal, he should have first complained to the party so internal dispute resolution mechanisms can be applied, but going to the tribunal first is wrong, Ikombe MCA and deputy speaker Nathaniel Nganga said.He urged Cord to prevail on the tribunal because there is a feeling it is interfering with the assembly's decision. Kathinzi told the Star he is consulting his lawyers on the next move. This was a party affair and it is clear the party has no faith in Mwonga as the majority leader. He cannot now start imposing himself on us when it is very clear he is no longer needed, he said.
