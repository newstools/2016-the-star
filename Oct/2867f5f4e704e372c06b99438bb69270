This is significant when it comes to more informed assessments of the resource allocation decisions undertaken by governments, said Stephen Ochieng, a partner at PwC."The e-learning certified programme is now live and is open to anyone who works in the public sector and wants to enhance their financial management skills," Campbell said.
