Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (pictured) has criticised opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s supporters, calling them cows.In a post on his official Facebook account, Kuria accused them of being behind a fake blog with quotes attributed to him about Deputy President William Ruto.He said the blog will not deter Ruto from becoming President in 2022.&ldquo;You Cord idiots, wake up to this reality. Raila will never be President of Kenya,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;On the other hand, in five years and 10 months, [DP William] Ruto will be the fifth President of Kenya.&rdquo;He continued: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like this go and take a nap on the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria. Mukagimara ri ngombe ichi?&rdquo;This loosely translates to: &ldquo;When will you grow up, you cows?&rdquo;The first-term MP has been on the spotlight for making defamatory remarks in public gatherings.
