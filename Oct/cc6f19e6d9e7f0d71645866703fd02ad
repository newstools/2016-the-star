A Kwale hotelier has urged politicians to avoid making tribal and divisive remarks.Diani Reef Beach Resort and Spa chief executive Titus Kangangi said the tourism industry never recovered after the 1997 Kaya Bombo chaos. He said politicians who incite Kenyans should be given a blackout by the media.Kangangi spoke to journalists on Saturday at the hotel. At least we feel politicians are maturing because in the recent months we have not seen inciting statements, Kangangi said.He urged politicians to conduct well-organised campaigns. They should make sure they don t divide the country along tribal lines. We don t want to see a repeat of the 2007-08 violence. It had serious negative effects on the tourism sector and many people lost jobs, Kangangi said.
