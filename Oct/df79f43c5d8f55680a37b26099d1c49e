Migori Governor Okoth Obado has blamed his rivals for creating drama and ensuring Cord leader Raila Odinga did not officially open the office he donated to ODM during his Tuesday visit.The governor donated an office just outside Migori town. ODM has an office at the county stadium. The office donated by Obado has been the centre of controversy and his rivals are said to be afraid that he is warming up to the ODM leadership after he defected to the party from PDP three months ago. Before I joined the party my rivals had been attacking me using the propaganda of being a Jubilee mole. My recent move back to the party and office has rendered this useless that is why they resisted [the office], Obado said.He said the new office can be used for other functions. The governor said he has been a life member of ODM. Obado spoke on Thursday morning on vernacular station Mayienga FM on the Gari Mar Okinyi radio show.
