A lawmaker has urged the Agriculture ministry to open the National Cereals and Produce Board depots and start buying maize from farmers. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said the government should buy a 90kg bag of maize for not less than Sh3,000.He was speaking at Zea in Trans Nzoia on Monday. Last year, the NCPB bought maize at Sh2,300 per bag, which Wamalwa termed exploitation. Last year, the government allocated Sh2.7 billion to buy maize. Our farmers have incurred huge expenses growing maize, he said. We will not allow our farmers to continue suffering. It is the responsibility of any government to ensure farmers are protected. Ninety per cent of Trans Nzoia residents are farmers. Wamalwa said it is wrong for middlemen to criss-cross the area buying maize for Sh1,800 per bag, when the government should set a reasonable price and buy.He said good prices will encourage farmers.
