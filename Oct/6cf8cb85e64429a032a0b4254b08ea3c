He said he invited professors to come for the lecture, but they never showed up. And after addressing a few students, he bestowed on himself the title &lsquo;professor&rsquo;.Attorney General Githu Muigai sought to know his law background. Mare said he did his pupilage after completing primary school education.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a law degree, but I have a lot of knowledge in the law profession,&rdquo; he said.Mare is among the candidates who were added to the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice and the apex court list of applicants following a court order.Others were Prof Makau Mutua, Supreme Court judge Jacktone Ojwang, retired judge Aaron Ringera, lawyer David Waihiga, defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya member Daniel Wambura, televangelist Lucy Wanja and carpenter Paul Kongani for CJ.Others were magistrate Judith Wanjala and chemist Isaac Rutenberg for DCJ.Court of Appeal judge Karanja Wanjiru did not show up for the interview yesterday, saying the panel should rate her using her results in the DCJ interviews.JSC communication officer Saulo Morton said following the communication, the interviews had ended and it was now upon the commission to announce a nominee for the post.During the DCJ interviews in which Court of Appeal judge Philomena Mwilu was selected, Wanjiru said delay in issuing judgment breeds corruption.

The judiciary says judgments are supposed to be delivered after one month.Karanja said she will ensure corruption is eliminated from the judiciary.
