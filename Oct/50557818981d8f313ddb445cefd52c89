The number of people in need of relief aid in Kilifi county is rising and the amount of food each family is given is not enough for one meal.More than 300,000 people have been affected by drought.Yesterday, the Star visited some distribution centres in Ganze constituency and found people walk back home with a kilo of maize, a quarter kilo of beans and 20ml of cooking oil.Some of them walk for more than 30km and queue for a whole day to get the rations. Those who are unlucky go back home without the food.Residents fear if the food is not increased soon, some people might die of hunger. Those at high risk are elderly people, who are unable to walk for long distances in search of the relief aid. Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro described the situation &ldquo;a big crisis&rdquo;.
