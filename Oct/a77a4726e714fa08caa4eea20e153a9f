Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has denied claims that he has incited nurses in the county to go on strike.He said at a press conference on Monday that he was surprised when he hear the allegations from Governor Peter Munya.Murungi said that he has not talked to any health worker having been away during the entire strike period."Neither is Mithika Linturi nor Florence Kajuju involved. If somebody has his own problems let him solve them himself," Murungi said.He added that the problem bedeviling the health sector is the arrogance of the governor, saying it will not take Meru anywhere."Let him be humble enough to sit down with the striking workers and discuss a return-to-work formula," the senator said."It is a big shame that the people of Meru are going for treatment in Isiolo, Tharaka Nithi and Laikipia," Murungi said.Read: Meru makes Sh17m loss as nurses strike During the Mashujaa Day celebrations on October 20, Munya had claimed that the nurses&rsquo; strike was not pegged on promotion issues.He said the boycott was politically motivated."We can see politics in this strike. Promotion letters of fifty nurses and clinical officers were ready before the strike began," the governor said."When we sat and negotiated a return to work formula, they told us to give them time to consult and we wonder who they are consulting because they never returned," said Munya. The senator at the same time asked Meru residents to vote out the governor on grounds that the current regime has no development record to show for its existence.He claimed that the county government allegedly spent Sh100 million on hospitality issues like paying for tea and buying flowers."I must say that we are concerned by the massive waste of resources in the county. Tea and flowers has gobbled up Sh100 million. I own a hotel and with that kind of money you can feed the starving people of Meru and build a hotel, why spend such money on a few officials," the senator said.
