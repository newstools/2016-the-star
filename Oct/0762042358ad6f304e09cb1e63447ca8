Cord leader Raila Odinga has condemned the government for keeping quiet over intensified fights between the Pokot and Marakwet at the Kerio Valley.Raila, in a statement from London on Saturday, said it was unfair for President Uhuru Kenyatta to act as if nothing was wrong in the region.He told Uhuru that the state cannot afford to give up on the role of providing security to all Kenyans in every part of the country.The opposition leader accused the government of letting the chaos escalate to levels where schools are closed, children orphaned, and the elderly forced to flee their homes.More than 500 people have fled their homes along the border between Marakwet East and Tiaty constituencies, while many others killed following the animosity between the two groups.Read: I m tired of burying my people killed by bandits, says MP Raila said it was not in good taste that the two communities have been left on their own in efforts to deal with the problem of finding lasting peace at the volatile valley since May."I wish to bring to the attention of the President that the carnage and lawlessness has gone on in the Kerio Valley since May 2016. It is getting intense each passing day," Raila said.He called for a firm, fair and honest intervention of the national government towards forestalling further loss of lives, cattle theft and banditry attacks on innocent citizens."Marakwet and Pokot community leaders need to break their silence that appears imposed by party affiliation and speak out loudly and boldly on the tragedy that has befallen their people," he said.Read: More cops deployed in Kerio Valley to pursue bandits "It must be recognised that on their own, both the Pokot and Marakwet communities have done all they could to bring peace to themselves through their elders, CBOs, youth and women groups," he said.Raila appealed to the two communities to keep pushing for peace among them, but was quick to note that they can not do much on their own. "The support by the national government is the missing link in the raging conflict," he said.Raila observed that security agencies on the ground seem incapable, immobilised and unwilling to provide the much-needed support."They are content with just supervising the anarchy," he said, further urging the communities to stop fighting each other.Also read: IG Boinnet orders arrest of bandits as Pokot, Marakwet clashes intensify "Pokot and the Marakwet should appreciate that they are victims of years of state neglect, massacres and marginalization," Raila said. He told the groups to instead jointly confront the national government with demands for their rightful share of development and compensation.The ODM leader said the solution to the cause of fights between the two groups was recommended by the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission.
