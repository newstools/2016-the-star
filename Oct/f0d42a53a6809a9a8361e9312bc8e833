The Mwala Mau Mau War Veterans Association has criticised Machakos MCAs effort to impeach Governor Alfred Mutua.Early this week, 46 out of 59 MCAs signed a petition to impeach him.The assembly members accuse the governor of abuse of office and abetting corruption.Mutua says the impeachment motion is meant to force him to support their campaigns using public funds earmarked for development projects.Chairman Johnson Kieti said the MCAs motives are dubious. These MCAs are money-hungry and want to be given public funds to feed their bellies, he said.Kieti spoke during a Mau Mau Veterans Association meeting in Mwala subcounty on Tuesday.He said the governor has proven his worth and they will not allow a few greedy politicians to taint his name. We can never have a leader like Governor Mutua and we will nevercost allow a few people, who want to fill their pockets with public funds, to destroy the county leadership, Kieti said. He said all the MCAs who signed the impeachment motion should forget votes of the association members. We are watching and agree with one voice not to reinstate whoever signed for impeachment, Kieti said. Mutua said, I am told some MCAs plan to impeach me because I have refused to fund their election campaigns. Let them proceed with their plans because the only money I have is for development. MCAs also want to remove assembly majority leader Joshua Mwonga,said to be the only elected member opposed to impeachment.
