The Mediheal Group of hospitals will open three liver clinics in Kenya after signing a partnership with India's Yashoda Institute of Liver Transplant and Hepatobiliary Diseases. The clinics will be located in Nairobi, Eldoret and Nakuru towns. The partnership with Yashoda Hospital will bolster care and management for liver patients, while encouraging foreign investment in Kenya's medical sector.The deal will see the hospital sink Sh250,000,000 in investments to enable patients access quality treatment in modern facilities at subsidized costs as well as reduce the number of patients traveling abroad for liver- related treatment.About 5000 Kenyans travel to India for treatment annually in cases ranging from kidney and liver transplants, joint replacement and different strains of cancer.Mediheal Group chairman S. R. Mishra said liver disease is on the increase especially in areas with frequent water contamination such as informal settlements.Mishra said doctors have reported increased cases of liver failure due to Hepatitis and HIV complications."Liver diseases are increasing at an alarming rate in the country, especially among people who are unable to afford the costly treatment. This partnership will enable patients access low-cost medical care for liver related illness, while raising our country's standards in management of liver disease," Mishra said. He added; "This investment aims to support the government's efforts and facilities to promote medical tourism, so that Kenya can become the "India of Africa" where nationals from other African countries can come and get treatment and hence creating a source of income for the country."Yashoda Hospitals Senior Consultant and Head of Liver Transplantation Balachandran Menon said the partnership will help reduce the mortality rates as a result of liver infections."Liver diseases in Kenya have been on the rise with patients opting to seek further treatment abroad. Bringing these facilities to the community significantly reduces the burden of managing the diseases from the patients and their families," Menon said.Menon said the clinics will commence with basic treatment of liver conditions which will be followed by liver transplants.He said the Mediheal Group will continue to sensitize communities on care and prevention of liver diseases including using properly treated water, clean ablution facilities and encouraging use of contraceptives that reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections such as Hepatitis B.The Mediheal Group also has plans to start bone marrow transplant procedures in Kenya.
