Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has declared the county pothole-free.Last month, the county sealed potholes on all major roads. &lsquo;&rsquo;I want to assure motorists the era of potholes is gone,&rdquo; Mutua said yesterday as he supervised the patching the last pothole on the Machakos - Kangundo road near Mutituni town.&ldquo;We as a people are good at constructing roads and buildings but very bad at maintaining them. This is what I want to change in Machakos,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;A pothole starts the size of a coin, and when it is neglected, it grows to the size of a shoe, a wheelbarrow, a car and before you know it, you need to construct a new road.&rdquo;Mutua said potholes will be sealed within 36 hours. &ldquo;We have put systems in place to do this,&rdquo; he said.Mutua said a rapid -response team has been set up to seal potholes.&ldquo;You will have to travel out of the county to see a pothole on a road. That I can assure you ,&ldquo; he said.Mutua urged residents to report potholes to the short code number 22502.&ldquo;I will fire officials who are asleep on the job. I urge wananchi to send an SMS with details of roads with potholes for action to be taken,&rdquo; he said.
