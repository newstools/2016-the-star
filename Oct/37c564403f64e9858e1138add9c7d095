Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has asked Cord leader Raila Odinga to join Jubilee Party, saying the opposition will lose next year.Kabogo said on Monday Raila has felt the cold of being out of government and has witnessed the development achieved by the Jubilee administration.He praised Cord governors, senators and MPs who joined JP before it was launched, saying they realised President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s administration is fulfilling its campaign pledges.&ldquo;JP will win with a landslide. The clever opposition leaders have joined JP,&rdquo; Kabogo said.&ldquo;Raila should follow suit. We used to be colleagues when we were MPs. I know he has a lot of stress staying outside the government. If he wants to be happy, he should join JP... I respect him and I&rsquo;m advising him in good faith.&rdquo;The governor spoke to residents in Lari constituency while inspecting county projects.He urged Raila to run for election using a JP ticket, adding that Jubilee has won the support of areas believed to be Cord zones.Kabogo said Cord&rsquo;s political style will not help Raila win.&ldquo;We have seen all manner of politics Cord is playing. I&rsquo;m telling them JP will not feel threatened. We are hoping the government will win with over 70 per cent of votes cast,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo urged residents to support county governments as they have struggled to fulfil election pledges.&ldquo;Be very careful when you listen to politicians aspiring for governor seats. Some want to make names for themselves, but I have always wanted to improve the lives of residents and that is what I have been doing all through,&rdquo; Kabogo said.He said the Kiambu government has rehabilitated roads, improved hospitals and medical services, given empowerment funds and supported youth and women.
