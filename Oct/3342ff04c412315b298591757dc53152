It was payback time in the National Assembly yesterday as women MPs asked their male colleagues to reject the two-thirds gender rule bill.The House was split down in the middle along gender lines during debate on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment ) Number 3, which seeks to entrench a progressive realisation of the gender principle.The bill by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee was touted as the middle ground after two other initiatives by majority leader Aden Duale and women MPs were dropped.But the women MPs told their male counterparts to reject the unpopular bill, which they argued has no time frames within which the principle should be implemented.They said it was time men appreciated their input in the House, including a situation where women threw their weight behind the controversial CDF Act.
