The government has come up with a new scheme of service for chiefs and assistant chiefs, allowing their promotion to higher positions in the administrative structure.Under the scheme, chiefs and their assistants can now rise to other positions, including assistant county commissioners, deputy county commissioners, county commissioners and regional coordinators, as long as they have relevant qualifications.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair for an officer to stay on the same job group for eight years. It&rsquo;s very demoralising and should never be allowed to happen,&rdquo; Interior PS Karanja Kibicho said. Under the previous scheme of service, chiefs and their assistants could only rise to the position of senior chief.Kibicho on Friday announced the new scheme of service, when he received at Harambee House Namunyiri assistant chief Caroline Vugutsa Olusala from Kakamega county. Olusala was in Nairobi for the first time on a trip sponsored by the PS.During Kibicho&rsquo;s official tour of Western last week, he asked who among chiefs and assistant chiefs had never been to Nairobi. Olusala was the only one courageous enough to raise her hand among the more than 400 chiefs, assistant chiefs, assistant commissioners and county commissioners.When Kibicho announced to the gathering he would sponsor her on a three-day tour of Nairobi, including a guided tour of Harambee House, more chiefs and assistant chiefs raised their hands, prompting laughter in the hall. Kibicho said, &ldquo;Too late for you. Unlike the assistant chief here, you didn&rsquo;t have the courage to do so earlier.&rdquo;During Olusala&rsquo;s discussions with Kibicho, it emerged she had been on the same job group since she was hired eight years ago. This prompted the PS to direct the ministry to immediately rectify the situation.
