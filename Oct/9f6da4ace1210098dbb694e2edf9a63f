ODM chairman John Mbadi has warned National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale to expect stiff opposition when he tables the motion to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. ...this time it will be more elaborate than what happened on December 18, 2014, when the motion on country security was tabled, he said. He was backed by woman reps Dennitah Ghati and Gladys Wanga, MP Opiyo Wandayi and Awendo MP aspirant Walter Sirawa.
