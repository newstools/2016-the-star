ODM chairman John Mbadi has warned National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale to expect stiff opposition when he tables the motion to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. &ldquo;...this time it will be more elaborate than what happened on December 18, 2014, when the motion on country security was tabled,&rdquo; he said. He was backed by woman reps Dennitah Ghati and Gladys Wanga, MP Opiyo Wandayi and Awendo MP aspirant Walter Sirawa.
