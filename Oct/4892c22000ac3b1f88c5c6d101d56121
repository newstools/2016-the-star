Secondary teachers kicked off negotiations for a salary raise on Wednesday with their employer during a meeting at a hotel in Naivasha.Kuppet Secretary general Akelo Misori said the talks were progressing well, adding that they were reviewing the proposed pay rates.This comes after TSC and KNUT reached an agreement to scrap P1 entry grade for teachers and also occasion promotion of qualified tutors."This is a long process that might take some days but the atmosphere from both sides is good. We are looking forward to a favorable agreement for our members," Misori said.A source in the meeting said that TSC had employed the tactics it used to reach a deal with KNUT.Read: Knut, TSC sign CBA to end perennial strikes, scrap off P1 entry grade "The plan is for the secondary school teachers to be promoted to the next grade as from next year meaning an automatic salary increase for them," said the source.Kuppet is seeking a 200 per cent salary increment for its members but the government ruled out the demand saying that it was not attainable.Meanwhile, KNUT has downplayed failure to hit the 300 per cent salary demand at the just concluded talks with the TSC.The union said that the CBA it signed with TSC was sweeter and better, noting that it would positively change the face of the teaching profession.At the Naivasha meeting, the union's main demand was the 300 per cent increment but the issue was not discussed during the signing ceremony.But Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion defended the pact noting that it has addressed bigger issues affecting teachers than just the salary issue."Rome was not built in a day and the salary issue is part of the ongoing negotiations but currently teachers are the biggest winners," he said.He noted that majority of the teachers in the country fell under the P1 level which had been scrapped as part of the deal."This means that over 100,000 teachers have been promoted directly as soon as the CBA gets into force and this is a major win for the profession," he said.He attributed the past industrial action that faced the profession to some government officials who were not keen to keep their promises."Previously, we had to rely on government promises that were not fulfilled but under the current CBA all the teachers demands and grievances will be resolved," he said.
