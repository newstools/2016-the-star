Murang&rsquo;a residents have warned Governor Mwangi Wairia against using county assets in his reelection campaign. They accused the administration of promoting the governor&rsquo;s candidacy by branding county vehicles with his image.&ldquo;Most vehicles have photos of the governor on them. He should not allow that because county assets are not private property,&rdquo; resident Joshua Wamae said.&ldquo;The President himself does not have his photos on government vehicles. It&rsquo;s unconstitutional and unnecessary. I believe if one wants to market himself, there are better and lawful ways to do it.&rdquo; Business consultant Macharia wa Mwihaki said it is wrong to use the vehicles for personal gain. &ldquo;Those vehicles do not belong to the governor.It would be nice to know the reason behind the branding and its significance to Murang&rsquo;a residents.&rdquo; he said. The residents feel Wairia is pursuing self-interest at their expense. Efforts to reach the governor or his office were unsuccessful. Calls and messages went unanswered.
