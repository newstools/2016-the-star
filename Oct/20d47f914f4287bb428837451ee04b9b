Machakos MCAs on Tuesday evening removed Masinga Central MCA Joshua Mwonga from his position as the majority leader and replaced him with Kivaa MCA Alexander Kathinzi.In the decision communicated in the House by speaker Bernard Mung ata, 17 out of 32 Cord members in the assembly had signed for the changes.The members accused Mwonga of arrogance and using his position to intimidate them, allegations Mwonga denied. I have not been removed because of poor performance, but for refusing to sign for the impeachment of Governor [Alfred] Mutua, he said.Mwonga said there are plans to sack the governor but the motion is yet to be presented before the House Business Committee for balloting.The motion might be brought to the House next week when the committee will sit again, he said.Unlike in a previous occasion where Mwonga rushed to court and obtained a stay order after being removed from his position, this time the Masinga MCA opted to accept the decision and congratulate the new majority leader. I warn him [majority leader] that the work ahead is not easy, Mwonga told journalists at the county assembly.Prayers for unityNew majority leader Kathinzi told the press that his first duty will be to call for interdenominational prayers for the assembly so we can start afresh and work together in harmony .He downplayed the impeachment plans and denied he had been given the leadership of the House to facilitate the governor s sacking.Kathinzi said it is too early for him to discuss the petition, but the motion would debated when it is brought to the assembly. We have numerous reports in the House and if the members deem it fit to use the reports to oust the governor, it is their decision, not mine, he said.Wamunyu MCA Kyalo Kyuli told the Star on Monday that 46 MCAs out of 59 had signed the petition to impeach the governor over misuse of public funds, abuse of office and integrity issues.However, reports say some MCAs withdrew their signatures.Kyuli said money for various projects has not been used as budgeted.He said funds were to be used for improvement of drainage systems, tarmacking of roads, water supply, including the de-silting of Maruba Dam in Machakos.
