MPs on Thursday questioned a driver linked to the NYS scandal about transactions totaling Sh346 million that were wired into his accounts.John Kago, a suspended driver with the Kenya Commercial Bank, is said to have received the funds from NYS key suspects Ben Gethi and Josephine Kabura.It is alleged he received Sh130 million from Gethi and Sh156 million from Kabura.Balambala MP Abdikadir Aden put Kago on the spot over the transactions between him, Kabura and Gethi.The MP said Kago and his company Good Luck Limited channeled the funds, contrary to Kago's evidence that he only received Sh60 million from Gethi's mother for purchase of property in Lavington, Nairobi.Read: Barclays, Equity among banks to be probed in Sh800 million NYS scandalBut Kago said he has never held any transactions or known Gethi and informed the committee that the said Sh346 million had been challenged in court. I have challenged the information that you are presenting to me in court. The money you are mentioning doesn t reflect in my account and no evidence has been adduced to show I received the money, he said.When probed about his relationship with Kabura, Kago told the committee that they met in December 2014 when Kabura wanted to buy some property."We met in the banking hall after somebody told me that she was lending money at an interest," Kago told the MPs."It is shocking that Kago was able to get a Sh60 million loan in the streets of Nairobi without any collateral ... this must have been a sweet deal," Kajiado North MP Joseph Manje said.It also emerged during proceedings that Kago owns property in Nairobi worth millions of shillings and a fleet of high-end vehicles.Kago said he runs an unregistered car hire with a Range Rover worth Sh23 million, a 350S Mercedes Benz and an eight-seater Toyota Fielder, as well as a property business.The Range Rover, KBC 700Z, is wanted by authorities. Kago is yet to surrender it as it is still with his client who hired it at a rate of Sh40,000 a day."The car has not been surrendered because the police issued orders that anybody found driving it be shot on sight. I know where the car is but I am unable to reach (the client) who hired it," said Kago.He was also unable to explain how he transferred the vehicle to lawyer Patrick Ogola before he was paid the purchase amount of Sh18 million."We entered into a sale agreement that I retain the car and transfer ownership to him until he clears the amount within 18 months. He has the logbook and I have the car," he told PAC.PAC Chair Nicholas Gumbo directed Kago to immediately surrender the vehicle to Assets Recovery Authority by Monday and report back to the committee. Gumbo questioned the rationale behind Kago s continued services as the KCB driver when his accounts holds millions of shillings."Are you a driver or a decoy? You own property worth millions of shillings including high-end vehicles that some of the privileged Kenyans like myself don t drive. It negates why people work," Gumbo said.More on this story: Nine Family Bank staffers suspended over Sh791million NYS scandal
