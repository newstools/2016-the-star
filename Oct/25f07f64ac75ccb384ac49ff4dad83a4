President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday pardoned 7,000 petty offenders who are about to clear their sentences.He made the announcement as he presided over Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kenyatta stadium in Machakos."Chief Justice sasa akona nafasi ya kufunga wale bonyenye ambao wameiba pesa mingi mingi. Nafasi kwa jela sasa imetoshea," he said.This loosely translates to: "The Chief Justice now has sufficient space to jail those accused of committing crimes on a large scale."The release was invoked by the Power of Mercy, which allows the President to pardon reformed prisoners on the advise of the advisory committee.Uhuru also emphasised the need for the judiciary to speed up graft cases pending in court."You have the space," Uhuru told Chief Justice David Maraga who attended the celebrations.Maraga was sworn in on Wednesday at State House, Nairobi. He pledged to reduce the backlog of cases and automate court proceedings to ensure justice for all.
