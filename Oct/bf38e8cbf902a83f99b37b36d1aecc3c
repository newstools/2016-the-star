Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday defended co-principals Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kalonzo Musyoka over their remarks on his presidential bid.He said the statements by the two are part of their plan to strengthen their parties. &ldquo;We agreed sometime back that each Cord affiliate should go out and market itself. That&rsquo;s what they are doing. We are still united and we will come back at the right time to pick a presidential candidate,&rdquo; Raila said. Kalonzo said at the weekend in Tononoka, Mombasa, he is the best candidate. Wetang&rsquo;ula wants the former Prime Minister to endorse him as Cord&rsquo;s presidential flagbearer.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the chase for the top seat, and each party has its game plan to strengthen itself,&rdquo; Raila said. He said each party is out to strengthen itself and consolidate its support.Raila (pictured) said the coalition will decide on how to pick a presidential candidate before the year ends. &ldquo;We all have a common agenda to win the next elections so the country can be run effectively and competently. We all want to stop corruption and promote unity in Cord,&rdquo; he said.ODM chairman John Mbadi assured Cord supporters the three co-principals will work together to win the next elections. &ldquo;Wiper says Kalonzo supported former President Mwai Kibaki in 2007 and Raila 2013 so we should support him. Wetang&rsquo;ula says he is the best candidate. ODM says Raila has sacrificed a lot for this country and is the best candidate. That&rsquo;s good for democracy. In the end, we&rsquo;ll support whoever emerges tops in the nomination,&rdquo; he said.
