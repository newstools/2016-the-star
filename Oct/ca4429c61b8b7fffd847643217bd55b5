International Neddy Atieno is a doubt for the forthcoming Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) finals set for Cameroon from November 19 to December 3.This is after the influential winger landed a job with the Kenya Defence Force.Atieno, who has been a regular in the national team assignments, begun playing for the national team in the under-20 category between 2009 and 2010 while still a student at Tartar Secondary School and later joined the senior team to date.Atieno said the new development was a blessing in the disguise but was quick to note that she will always avail her service when needed as long as she gets permission from her employer.&ldquo;I am indebted to the Football Federation Kenya for the support because it&rsquo;s through my engagement with the national team that I have gotten the job with the defence forces. Of course it&rsquo;s sad that I might not be with national team at this crucial stage but I wish them well,&rdquo; said the Makolander player.She added, &ldquo; I know my other team members are good and I wish them well in the AWCON. I am not also sure about my future with Makolanders because I will report to the KDF on October 29.&rdquo;Harambee Starlets head coach David Ouma said Atieno&rsquo;s absence in the team is big blow. &ldquo; We will try to talk to her new employer and see if she will make Cameron trip,&rdquo; the coach said.&ldquo;It goes without saying Atieno is an influential player and her services will come in handy during the AWCON finals. The federation will write a letter to see if she will be allowed to go to Cameroon and represent her country,&rdquo; Ouma said. At the same time, Enez Mango will also miss the Cameroon trip due to work commitment .Meanwhile, Ouma has included Vihiga Queens&rsquo; duo of Maurine Ater and Lilian Adera; Spedag&rsquo;s Sharon Bushenei; Gaspo Youth&rsquo;s Florence Awino; Soccer Queens&rsquo; Sharon Aluoch and Thika Queens&rsquo; duo of Monica Karambu and Lydia Akoth ahead of the International friendly match against Egypt this Friday.At the same time, Ouma has axed Soccer Queens duo of Purity Nyongesa and Ester Nandika, Vihiga Leeds&rsquo; Pauline Naise, Oserian Ladies&rsquo; Bertha Omita and Janet Bundi from Nyamira County Starlets.
