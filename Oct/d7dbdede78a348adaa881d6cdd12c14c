Three Morans were killed on Thursday evening by rangers based at Samburu Lodge in Archers post.Fifteen morans armed with spears and guns attacked the premises to demand the release of four women arrested by the rangers.Two died on the spot, while a third died upon arrival at the Isiolo Referra Hospital.The women, including the mother of a 4-month-old baby, are said to have trespassed the lodge in search of grass and green leaves to feed their young goats."We only wanted to question, warn and free them, but within a few minutes war ensued when the group attacked my team," said Gabriel Lapariyo, the Samburu National Reserve security warden.The women were released after the shoot out. None of them was injured as they all took cover under the office furniture.Ongoing drought in the region is said to have made the women trespass the lodge in search of food for their animals.More on this: Samburu residents resort to wild fruits as Sh11m relief food remains undelivered
