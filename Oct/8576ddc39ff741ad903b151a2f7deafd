Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok has accused Jubilee Party of planing to rig the Kalokol ward by-election slated for Wednesday next week.The governor castigated Senator John Munyes over comments allegedly made by the legislator that Jubilee will use its machinery to grab the seat from ODM.Jubilee, in their campaigns, said they will use all available means to ensure that they win the October 26 mini-poll.Governor Nanok on Saturday put the senator on notice for what he termed as "divisive politics during their campaigns"."I call upon all the security&nbsp; agencies not to involve in this process of denying the citizens their constitutional right," Nanok said.Read: IEBC officials can&rsquo;t hold free and fair poll, says Nanok"Threatening to manipulate the decision of the people by forcefully rigging the elections is not acceptable," he said.He criticised a group of legislators in the county who have decided to take sides even on matters that affect the common citizen.The governor, who has been taunted over his alliance with Turkana Central MP John Lodepe, said they have a common agenda of serving the people who elected them.He said that he is working with the Jubilee legislator towards solving the problems that commonly affect the community."Our difference is on political parties. I am in Cord and Lodepe is in Jubilee. But when it comes to solving the problems affecting the community, we come together," the governor said.Nanok said it was wrong for Jubilee legislators to throw insults at Lodepe for working with the county government."Let our political ideologies not lead us to divisive leadership that will lead to division of our people,"&nbsp; he said.Two camps led by the governor one side and the other by senator Munyes have emerged ahead of the polls.
