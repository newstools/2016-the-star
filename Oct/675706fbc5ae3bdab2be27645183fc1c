The Baptist Convention of Kenya, which has more than 3,000 churches and schools, has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and end grabbing of its land and property at the Coast.Gilbert Kabage, a trustee and the secretary to the Convention s board, on Thursday said three of its Mombasa schools are being taken over illegally by the county. He cited Kiembeni Baptist, Kisauni Baptist and St John s First Baptist in Likoni.Kabage said Kiembeni Baptist School has been at the centre of controversy since 2003. The old Municipal Council of Mombasa had taken over ownership of the school, but in 2003, the Convention went to court to challenge it.
