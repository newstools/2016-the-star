Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba was confronted by angry youths in Mombasa who accused him of betraying ODM leader Raila Odinga.The youths, some were donning ODM shirts, demanded that Ababu addresses them, some blocking his exit path. The MP had just come out of a church service at Glory Worship Center at Bangla, Jomvu constituency.The youths, about 30 in number who appeared drunk, shouted that the legislator should not have ditched ODM. The legislator resigned from the ODM secretary general post in June and later relaunched the Labour Party of Kenya.It took the intervention of Labour Party of Kenya organising secretary Peter Ole Musei to cool them off.But Namwamba later told the Star that the youths, who he described as 'good boys', were airing their 'genuine grievances'. "Would they have allowed me to address them if they had ill-intentions? These are people who saw a perfect avenue to have their serious grievance sorted," he said.He said if the youths were rowdy as purported, his car windows would have been smashed.The former ODM secretary general said such incident is normal in the political scenes.LPK secretary general David Makali said the incident should not be confused to mean a hostile reception.Read: Third force party will not join Jubilee, Ababu says
