Deputy President William Ruto has criticised the Opposition for seeking external financial support to influence 2017 general election.Ruto said Kenyans should be allowed to elect their own leaders without influence from outsiders.The DP said it was unfortunate that Opposition leaders led by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga were seeking cash support from outsiders.He said at Bukhalalire High School, Butula constituency, Busia County&nbsp;on Saturday, that Kenyans were best placed to elect leaders without such help.&quot;It is unfortunate that some of our worthy competitors are asking foreigners&#39; help to fund&nbsp;their campaigns and influence the forthcoming polls,&quot; Ruto said.Ruto said that they are not shaken by such moves since Kenyans voted for Jubilee in the 2013 elections despite pressure from outsiders.&quot;Kenyans have before and will again reject any external attempts to influence them during elections. Kenyans are well placed to elect leaders who are development conscious,&quot;&nbsp; he said.The DP told the Luhya community to vote for Jubilee Party, adding that he was optimistic it will form the government after the 2017 general election.Ruto asked the community not to waste their vote by on &quot;those who are destined to lose&quot;.&quot;I ask you to support Jubilee in the 2017 election. Those in the Opposition have no agenda for you. When we plan development they are busy planning for demonstrations,&quot; he said.&nbsp;He said Jubilee was committed to eliminating politics based on ethnicity, citing the recent move to bring all its affiliate parties together under one party.&quot;Politics based on this tribe versus that tribe have no room in this century. This is why we are asking all Kenyans to join us in uniting all the Kenya&rsquo;s ethnic communities,&quot; the DP said.&quot;You should not be misled to support individuals who are yet to decide on who their flag bearer will be,&quot; he said.&quot;We should discourage politics based on tribalism. All of us are in Kenya because of God&rsquo;s wish and not by bad luck. We should therefore build bridges among all of us,&quot; he added.He said that the government remains committed to provision of water, electricity, roads, schools, hospitals&nbsp;among other development projects.&quot;We cannot focus our energies on empty politicking,&quot; Ruto said, adding that the government has increased the amount of money for free education by 30 per cent per child.&nbsp;&quot;Education is&nbsp;important for any meaningful development of any country. This is why we have also relieved parents the burden of paying&nbsp;examination fees,&quot; he said.He said&nbsp;433 schools in Busia County up&nbsp;from 210 in 2013 have been connected to electricity in a measure towards accelerating technological needs of pupils.&quot;We have also connected 45,160 households in the county up from 14,000&nbsp;in 2013. This is a clear indication that we are determined to ensuring universal access to electricity among Kenyans,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Ruto was accompanied by MPs Michael Onyura (Butula), Mary Emase (Teso South), Busia deputy governor Kizito Wangalwa and former MPs Raphael Wanjala and Christine Mango.The leaders said they will support the Jubilee Administration.Emase said residents of Busia county were ready to work with the government for&nbsp;development.&quot;People of Busia are not ready to be left in the opposition come the next general election. They are ready to work with Jubilee which I am sure will form the next government,&quot; Emase said.Onyura said it is time leaders differentiated between politics and development, adding that problems facing Kenyans could not be solved if leaders stopped politicising development projects.&nbsp;
