Teachers' hopes of getting a new salary increment were dashed on Tuesday after a CBA signed between KNUT and TSC only accorded them a chance for promotions.The comprehensive bargaining agreement provided that the teachers would be promoted before July 2017, further scrapping off the P1 grade entry level for teachers.The deal was reached after a two-day retreat for the union and the commission at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha which ended on Tuesday.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said that the agreement would change the lives of teachers positively and also boost education standards in the country.He said that there were over 106,000 teachers under the P1 grade who would be promoted under the new agreement effective July 1, 2017."The P1 grade which is the entry level for all teachers has been scrapped and all the teachers on that level promoted, meaning that they will get a salary increment," he said.He added that they would continue to review the CBA, hailed as the first to be signed by teachers in the country's history."Under the CB, we shall no longer have the industrial unrest that has been the norm among teachers and we expect the education standards to improve," Sossion said.Reading the resolutions, TSC CEO Nancy Macharia said that the CBA had recognised the need to upgrade the lowest entry of a P1 teacher.She added that the agreement had also expanded the grading structure of the top cadre of all the teachers."The CBA has created distinct career paths for all teachers and this will ensure that both the teachers in administrative and non-administrative positions have clear career progression paths," she said.On his part Knut chairman Mudzo Nzili said that they were not coerced into signing the agreement, terming the development as a major milestone in the profession.He thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for initiating talks on the CBA, adding that the terms and services for teachers would be improved."The talks were open and frank,"Nzili said.TSC chair Lydia Nzomo noted that for the last nine years, industrial strikes had been the norm in the sector but was quick to note that this would now end."We want to thank all the government agencies that made this exercise a success and we expect the agreement to address education standards and syllabus," she said.Read: Sign CBA by October, teachers warn TSC
