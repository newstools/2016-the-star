A Kisumu MCA has urged the Livestock Committee to investigate the criteria used to distribute animals in the Sh17.5 million project.Nyakach West MCA Elijah Ochieng on Thursday said residents were removed from the list of beneficiaries and replaced with ward representatives. The project was launched last month and was to benefit 350 women&rsquo;s groups in the 35 wards. The government bought 81 cows, 70 goats, 35 bucks, 35 rams and 150 beehives. Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s wife Ida launched the project. She urged women to take up farming to improve their livelihoods and the county&rsquo;s economy. Ochieng said the county selected farmers and gave them seeds as they waited for the animals.He said after the procurement, the beneficiaries were invited to the Mamboleo Showground to receive the animals but some left empty-handed.&ldquo;Some people whose names were in the list did not get the animals. Instead some MCAs and officials took them,&rdquo; Ochieng said.Speaking to the Star on the phone, he called for investigations.&ldquo;We want to know who was given the animals meant for the selected farmers. The Internal Auditor in the Agriculture ministry has a list of those who received the animals and it is different from those who were meant to benefit from them,&rdquo;Omondi said.Livestock officials were unavailable for comment.
