Kencom Sacco, largely owned by employees of Kenya Commercial Bank, expects to complete the construction of 113 four-bedroom maisonettes on 20 acres in Runda next month. The project, which started in August 2013, has been funded by National Bank&rsquo;s Musharaka Construction Mortgage for about Sh2 billion. Under the Islamic mortgage product, the developer provides land while the bank funds construction with profit being shared at negotiated ratios. For the Runda project, National Bank settled for 14 per cent of annual profit from revenues until the loan is cleared. &ldquo;There is a strong growth in Islamic banking in Kenya based on the reception we have seen since the launch of our Amanah segment (in April 2013),&rdquo; National Bank of Kenya CEO Wilfred Musau said. Musharaka is a profit-loss Sharing System whereby the bank enters into partnership with a customer normally for a limited duration for a specific project. The partners&rsquo; share of profit is stated in terms of percentage or ratio or fraction of anticipated profits and not as an absolute fixed amount. This share of profit may or may not be determined on pro-rata basis to the capital contributed by each partner.
