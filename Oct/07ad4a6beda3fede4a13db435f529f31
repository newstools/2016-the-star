The Kakamega county government has been accused of failing to allow public participation in planning, identifying and implementing projects.A survey conducted by the National Anti-Corruption Steering Committee in collaboration with the Kakamega county Anti-Corruption Civilian Oversight Committee reveals the executive imposes projects on communities without prioritising development.Speaking after visiting the Shiatsala ECDE centre put up by the county for Sh2 million, NACCSC member Everline Rono criticised the county officials for failing to adhere to constitutional requirements. The committees launched the social audit of both national and county government projects in Kakamega on Wednesday. We ve noted the county is putting up ECDE classrooms in each of its 60 wards and upgrading 10km roads in every ward without consulting residents. This goes against the Constitution, which demands it involves residents, Rono said. The committees were informed the county Project Management committee was left out.
