The Nairobi solution lies with Kenneth... I hope Kidero is ready to prove what he has done for the people."Brian Weke, former aspirant for the Embakasi West MP seat, said Kenneth's move would propel him to being the next Mt Kenya leader after President Uhuru Kenyatta retires from politics."Kenneth has realised that he needs to support Uhuru in 2017 because it springs him to the national platform," he said."Just like Uhuru did in 2007, foregoing his candidature and supporting Kibaki, Kenneth can achieve this because of his good character and demeanor. He is a suitable leader."But Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said Kenneth's interest in the seat was far-fetched."In the last election Kenneth got 72,000 votes as a presidential candidate. That is not going to help because in Nairobi he needs to make us understand how he is going to achieve one million votes," he said."The former MP is just trying to get a job, hoping to be the next Mt Kenya leader. This will not be at the expense of the people of Nairobi."
