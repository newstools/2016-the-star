President Uhuru Kenyatta has on Saturday travelled to Khartoum, Sudan, for a two-day official visit at the invitation of President Omar al-Bashir. During the visit, Uhuru will lead the Kenyan delegation at bilateral talks that will focus on issues of common interest between Kenya and Sudan, including regional peace and security. Uhuru is also expected to meet the Kenyan diaspora in Sudan.  In August, the President travelled to South Sudan to discuss with President Salva Kiir the progress of the implementation of the peace deal signed last year in a bid to end conflict that threatens to tear the country apart. Uhuru serves as the focal point for the Igad in South Sudan. Igad is a grouping of eight Eastern Africa nations that focuses on development and drought control in the region.
