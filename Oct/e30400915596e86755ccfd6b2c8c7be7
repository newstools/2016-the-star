I do not believe that government can solve every problem faced by the people, especially the youth," Agwingi said.Abdulsalaam is also keen on clinching the Jubilee Party ticket, and has already hit the ground rallying delegates to support his nomination.Agwingi says he is confident that his charisma, suave and good oratory skills will sway the support his way.He also hopes that his mastery of five languages including English, Swahili, Luo, Somali and Arabic will endear him to both the Muslim and Christian voters.Read: Two Mombasa county officials to run for senatorAgwingi cut his political teeth in the 2005 referendum when he emerged as one of the mobilisers for the Orange team."I gained a great deal experience from the plebiscite," he says, also referring to his role in the 'Get out the Vote' campaign for ODM in 2007 as some of the key boosters to his bid.Agwingi defected to TNA at the beginning of 2016 before the outfit merged with other political parties to form Jubilee Party.As a former schoolmate of President Uhuru, Agwingi defends the president as a person but says the government has to up its game."The government consumes too much and does too little for the people. The civil service is neither civil nor a good deliverer of services," he said.The aspirant says that he will bring a different style of politics in Mombasa, first seeking to end 5-hour political meetings characteristic of seasoned politicians."My meetings are short and precise. They are aimed at delivering messages when people are still fresh and not when they are already tired from standing and waiting for politicians," he said.Agwingi says he is not a student of the dance theatrics that is commonplace in Kenya s political scenes."Instead, I like spending time educating the electorate about the political process. That is why I like my meetings short and precise," he stated.His father Argwings Kodhek made a name for himself as an ambitious and fearless defender of human rights.An astute lawyer, Kodhek represented the Mau Mau at a time when many feared being associated with the outlawed group."It is this fearless nature if my father that I admired most," Agwingi said.Just like his ambitious father, he has already set his sights on the Mombasa governor seat in 2022 and a national political office in 2027.
