A journalists' union has demanded the resignation of Health PS Nicholas Muraguri for "defending" corruption and allegedly threatening a Business Daily staff member.The newspaper had reported that Sh5 billion was stolen by the ministry's officials through manipulation of the Integrated Financial Management System.An audit indicated that the stolen money was wired to fake suppliers in 2015/16 financial year."Top on the list of fraudulent transactions identified in the audit report was the diversion of Sh889 million meant to be disbursed to county governments to support the free maternity care programme and its use in the purchase of phantom mobile medical clinics for urban slums," the BD story reads in part.It further claimed that a large chunk of the money (Sh800 million) was paid to Estama Investment Limited.Business Daily claimed Muraguri came to the ministry's defence saying the government can get into newsrooms systems and see what they write before it is published."Someone can be reading your story while seated here. If there is need to hack Nation's system we can," he told a journalist in a phone message when asked about the audit report."We can even confirm how much money is in your account now."The Kenya Union of Journalists asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to demand accountability by public officers who believe espionage in newsrooms is the only cure to corruption in government ministries."Besides dancing on the graves of Kenyans, Muraguri disclosed that the government will consider hacking into systems of newsrooms, and spy on journalists," said union secretary Eric Oduor.The union said a public officer entrusted with saving lives cannot afford to defend the loss of Sh5 billion with threats to the media.Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the theft claims resulted from an audit report that was reportedly leaked to the media before those implicated could respond.Mailu added that matter falls under the Kenya National Audit Office, which he noted was auditing the Health ministry's 2015/16 financial reports."The ministry assures it is open to internal and external scrutiny to ensure transparency and proper utilisation of allocated funds," he said in a statement on Wednesday.He underlined that corruption will not be tolerated and that action will be taken once the audit is completed.
