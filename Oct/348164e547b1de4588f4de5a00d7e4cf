Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has asked the President not to waste his energy responding to opposition leader Raila Odinga s views on corruption.Kiunjuri accused opposition leader Raila of politicising the war and attempting to tarnish Uhuru Kenyatta s name to prevent his re-election in 2017.He said Raila was grasping at anything to drag the President's name in the mud for political gain, but noted his efforts will come to naught. When Raila wakes in the morning instead of asking his wife for tea he speaks about Uhuru," said the CS."When he goes to a hotel, instead of speaking to a waiter he speaks about Uhuru and before he sleeps he has to talk about Uhuru. The President should leave Raila to us because we can handle him."He spoke in Buuri constituency, Meru county, durign a funeral on Monday.Kiunjuri said Raila s name had been mentioned in multiple scandals including in the Kenya Airways saga, maize scandal and the case of the Kisumu molasses plant.He asked the Cord leader not to portray himself as clean. What we are telling Raila is that we have enough information about him and we can talk about him for a whole year," he said."If we talk about his history and sins, it would be as voluminous as the Bible. We know about him in bad light and can fill twenty pages of advertisements in newspapers."Laikipia East MP Peter Kimaru said Raila launched attacks against Uhuru after realising his attempt to tarnish Deputy President William Ruto s name had borne no fruit.Kiunjuri was accused of corruption but three NGO bosses disowned an affidavit sent to the EACC claiming he demanded a Sh20 million bribe from them.The Cabinet Secretary also told the Star that the affidavit was "rubbish and propaganda".More on this: Three NGO directors disown affidavit alleging Sh20 million bribe to KiunjuriAlso read: Kiunjuri dissolves NGOs board, suspends Fazul day after corruption claims
