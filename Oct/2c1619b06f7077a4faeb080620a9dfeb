Deputy President William Ruto has said Jubilee Party will send opposition leader Raila Odinga into the early retirement should he run against President Uhuru Kenyatta at the 2017 election.He the opposition is too weak to compete against the government and challenged Raila to look for an alternative candidate. Ruto spoke in Kisii town on Sunday.He has been on a charm offensive in opposition strongholds and has been in South Nyanza three times in the past two weeks. I don t see Agwambo beating us in 2017. He failed to do so in 2013, when we were not even in government. We will send him to early retirement should he insist on running against us because we are much more organised than his team, Ruto said He is a statesman. I don t want him to be embarrassed. Let him give us an alternative candidate to face us. The DP said Jubilee will continue invading opposition strongholds, saying Kenyans are tired of the politics of divisions and rhetoric .
