With the arrival of a new Venezuelan Ambassador to Nairobi in July 2013, the embassy and the Kenyan government resumed activities related to Sponsor a School in Africa programme in the country.The Embassy requested collaboration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and international Trade of the Republic of Kenya for the purpose of assessing mechanisms to reactivate the program. On March 07, 2014, the then Education CS Prof. Jacob Kaimenyi and the Venezuelan Embassy agreed to make a joint evaluation for the implementation of the Venezuelan cooperation programme in three counties.Kajiado, Meru and Garissa counties were picked owing to their locations and poor performance in nation examinations. The proposed project, with an estimated execution period of nine weeks, consisted of the construction of an additional block of five classrooms, which would make it possible to expand the total capacity of the school and reduce the number of students per classroom.Recently, the Venezuela's Ambassador to Kenya, Johny Balze Arismendi, officially opened five classrooms at Ilbissil Township Primary. The construction of the classrooms was funded by the Republic of Venezuela at a cost of Sh10.3 million. Ilbissil was picked by the Ministry of Education and a proposal was made to the embassy which took over the work immediately.The town of Ilbissil was established during the 1890s, becoming the centre for trade in livestock for all of the Maasai territories that then stretched from the South of Nairobi to Dodoma, Tanzania.To date, livestock and herding animals remain the main economic activities of this fast-growing town, its cattle market being one of the largest in Kenya, with daily sales of 3,000 heads of cattle and 10,000 goats and sheep.From the geographical and socio-economic point of view, the main problem of Ilbissil is the lack of water. The town developed around a seasonal river, but during periods of drought the flow dries and the area is affected by the absence of water resources, primarily because the local company providing water (Tanathi Water Company) went into bankruptcy.One of the main social problems of Ilbissil Township is related to number issues that have to do with primary education in the area. It concerns both, the number and conditions of the existing educational units and some traditional customs of the population of this region.First, there is a problem involving the insufficiency of educational units, considering the number of inhabitants of this town in full growth and its surrounding areas. There are only four primary schools in Ilbissil and its surrounding.Major challenges in promoting education there include traditions and cultural conditions among the Maasai that don t place much value on educating girls instead opting to marry them off.
