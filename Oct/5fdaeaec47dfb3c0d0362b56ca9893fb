Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria has been warned of dire consequences if he fails to answer questions put before him by the Senate Public Accounts committee.Committee chairman Anyang' Nyong'o said Wa Iria will be obliged to answer all questions in accordance with the constitution and relevant acts of Parliament,"Wa Iria is reported in the press as contending that he will not answer certain questions ... but he must be warned about the dire consequences of his intentions," Nyong'o said on Thursday.More on this: Four governors ignore queriesWa Iria appeared for the sixth time before the committee on Tuesday to shed light on several tenders the Murang'a county government awarded various contractors.He denied claims that he deliberately split tenders in order to reward his favourite companies, contrary to the law. The Governor also denied awarding the tenders without competitive bidding.He said he will honour Senate summons to discuss other issues, but will not be taken back to answer queries on matters he has already cleared with the Senate and the House.Wa Iria expressed concern that the Senate may be used by individuals to seek political mileage by accusing Governors of lack of accountability.Last year, the Governor survived an impeachment motion after the Senate declares that accusations against him did not meet the threshold to remove him from office.Read: Senate approves 11 member committee to probe Wa Iria impeachmentWa Iria was impeached on October 21 after 34 out of 49 MCAs voted for his removal on alleged gross violation of the constitution, gross misconduct and abuse of office.
