A group of farmers in Kwaregi village in Lari constituency has urged young people to form agricultural groups and seek assistance from the county government.They praised Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and the Agriculture department for giving them a green house to improve their farming.Kwaregi Pioneer Organic Self Help Group chairman James Wachira said they started the group in 2008 and used to grow different local vegetables and look for a market in supermarkets and hotels in Nairobi. We used to grow plants without the use of fertiliser and chemicals such as pesticides. We search for ways of ensuring we achieve healthy produce, he said. We aim at feeding ourselves and our customers with foods free from chemicals. We use natural manure from our livestock, the chairman says.The chairman said they invite agricultural officials to train their 25 members on different types of farming.He says they received the greenhouse in August, together with tissue culture banana seedlings, tree tomatoes as well as tomatoes seeds and seedlings. We have been farming these tissue culture bananas and the tree tomatoes as we continue to receive training. In fact, a lot of farmers are ordering for seedlings from our greenhouse. We are making profit, he said.Speaking in his office yesterday, Kabogo said the government bought 80 greenhouses measuring eight by 18 meters at the cost of Sh32 million in 2014-15 to boost agriculture.The governor said more than 20,000 farmers have been trained on agricultural technology. We appreciate that lands have been subdivided among family members and some receive tiny shares, he said.
