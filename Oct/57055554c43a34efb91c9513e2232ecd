Many Kenyans and their observers will welcome the appointment yesterday of Michael Joseph as Chairman of the Kenya Airways Board of Directors and a director.Joseph was the first CEO of mobile network operator Safaricom, a position he held for 10 years and from which he built the company into the eastern and Central African region&rsquo;s largest corporation by profitability. At the ailing KQ, he has just joined the region&rsquo;s biggest loss-making corporation ever &ndash; and in a non-executive capacity.In the press statement announcing Joseph&rsquo;s appointment, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia noted at one point that he &ldquo;has extensive international experience&rdquo; and took Safaricom &ldquo;from a subscriber base of 18,000 to 17 million in a period of just 10 years&rdquo;.Management has been a major issue in KQ&rsquo;s massive troubles and there was reference to &ldquo;possible acts of theft and corruption&rdquo; in CS Macharia&rsquo;s statement.Which raises an important question: Where are the people who brought KQ so low?
