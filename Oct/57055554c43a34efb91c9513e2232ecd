Many Kenyans and their observers will welcome the appointment yesterday of Michael Joseph as Chairman of the Kenya Airways Board of Directors and a director.Joseph was the first CEO of mobile network operator Safaricom, a position he held for 10 years and from which he built the company into the eastern and Central African region s largest corporation by profitability. At the ailing KQ, he has just joined the region s biggest loss-making corporation ever and in a non-executive capacity.In the press statement announcing Joseph s appointment, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia noted at one point that he has extensive international experience and took Safaricom from a subscriber base of 18,000 to 17 million in a period of just 10 years .Management has been a major issue in KQ s massive troubles and there was reference to possible acts of theft and corruption in CS Macharia s statement.Which raises an important question: Where are the people who brought KQ so low?
