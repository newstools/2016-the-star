The High Court has been petitioned to stop the implementation of a Sh1.2 billion automation project by the Kenya Revenue Authority, pending conclusion of all cases surrounding it.Through Mwangi Mburu &amp; Associates, a member of the public, Elias Mwangi, complained the courts have delayed hearing and determining three cases filed about the project.He said despite the delay in concluding the hearings, KRA has been allowed to continue with implementation.The Integrated Customs Management System, whose contract was signed in July 2015, is a joint project between TradeMark East Africa, who are the financiers, and KRA, the client. The system is to replace KRA s Simba System.With the new system, the tax collector seeks to fully automate its customs and revenue collection. TMEA awarded the contract to French company Bull SAS.This prompted the Webb Fontaine Group, a Swiss company, which also made a bid, to challenge the process before the Public Procurement Administrative Board. In its ruling, PPOA said the procurement process was violated but dismissed the case on grounds it was filed outside the time frame stipulated in the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. This saw Webb Fontaine move to court.In the second case pending in court, KRA has challenged PPOA s findings that it flouted the process. Mwangi says the procurement process was fraudulent and the public stands to lose financially. Unless the orders sought are granted, the outcome of this petition shall be compromised as the public shall have used Sh900 million on a wrongly procured system, reads the petition presented before Justice George Odunga.Webb Fontaine says Bull provided incorrect information on earlier projects and experience. But TradeMark says the process was aboveboard.
