EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea has led a team of eight detectives to Afya House in Nairobi for a session on the Sh5 billion Health ministry scam. Detectives are seeking to unearth transactions concerning a leaked audit report that showed massive loss of public funds. Mubea walked to an office on the 6th floor without addressing journalists. But he later said the investigation will be conducted expeditiously . "The EACC had been conducting its investigations but opened a fresh probe following media reports of an audit report," he said. The deputy boss added that&nbsp;Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu assured all documents will be availed. Mubea said they hope to get all the documents by the end of the day or tomorrow.The commission will give a brief on the investigations in a week, he said, noting the EACC and the Health ministry have both formed investigating teams.The audit showed the Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis) was manipulated to allow payments to various companies.Among them was Esaki Ltd, an organisation associated with former EACC boss Philip Kinisu, which is said to have&nbsp;received&nbsp;Sh200 million. Senators asked Mailu and Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri to take responsibility for the mess. The CS is expected to address a press conference on the matter at 2pm.
