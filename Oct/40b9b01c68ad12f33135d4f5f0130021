The Nakuru county government has agreed to meet all the warring parties involved in garbage collection in Naivasha and resolve a one-week impasse.The county has said it is ready to listen to proposals from one of the warring groups and allow it to collect garbage from estates not currently covered under the programme.Last week, it offered tenders to new companies from various estates. This angered contractors that have been in it for years, leading to a physical war between the two groups. One youth leader was arrested in a move that saw garbage collection stall.Naivasha subcounty administrator Julius Nyaata yesterday said there is room for all players. He urged those locked out to present their proposals on where they intend to collect garbage and their cases will be considered.
