Communication to the committee said they were holed up in a meeting at the ministry headquarters following the revelation. The committee said it will hold a meeting with Mailu and Muraguri next Tuesday but called for a seizure of assets owned by the PS and a caveat on all the property to avert loss of public funds until the scandal is addressed. The committee chaired by Migori Senator Wilfred Machage asked the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission and the DCI to investigate the alleged theft."We will not sit down and watch as people swindle public funds. Something must be done swiftly... Seize property owned by the accused to recover public funds," said Machage.The chairman regretted that the audit process could take up to three years, and that the swindled funds could have been spent by then."It is unfortunate that what we are doing is a postmortem but this theft has be caught in the neck, " he said. Wajir Senator Abdullamani Ali said the scandal is weighty and requires swift intervention to save public funds. "When the Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governor had sh3.5 million snatched by a bodyguard we saw police swing into action and recover some money," he noted."We want the same one on Muraguri and his accomplices. Kenyans must be told the truth; the ministry should allay the fears without delay."He asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to ask the PS to step aside because his continued stay in office will interfere with investigations.
