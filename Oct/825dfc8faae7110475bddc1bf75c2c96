Sidian Bank, formerly known as K-Rep bank (but is not listed at the securities exchange) yesterday announced that it has embarked on a voluntary retirement scheme.

EABL is well supported at these price levels. KenGen, which fell sharply after the release of its financial year earnings and some -13.77 per cent on Friday, stabilised and closed unchanged at Sh5.95 with 521,100 shares changing hands. The share price reaction on Friday was overcooked and in part because of the dividend pass and an optically big dividend payment to the GoK. The share price remains undervalued but the management needs to start promoting the investor story.Deacons EA shares are down by 58 per cent since it listed at the NSE on August 2 through yesterday morning. Deacons closed limit down -9.72 per cent at Sh5.70.
