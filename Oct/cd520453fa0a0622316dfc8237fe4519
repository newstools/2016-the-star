Transport CS James Macharia has threatened severe action against civil servants who do not follow the Fly Kenya policy (see P19). KQ has been flying through severe turbulence. Some problems were inherited from the previous regime, in particular the over-ambitious purchase of Dreamliners for inter-continental flights when regional routes are less competitive and more profitable.This put KQ into a serious cash flow crisis which forced the airline into cost-cutting. The staff don't like that. Pilots and cabin crew have taken industrial action while engineers have run away to foreign airlines, all causing flight delays, which only make matters worse.It is doubtful that a change of management, as demanded by the pilots, would solve anything. One way that government can help, as Macharia suggests, is to insist that civil servants only fly KQ, something that sadly has not been happening. Flying KQ is the best way for government to support a company in which it is a major shareholder.Quote of the day: "Life is the farce which everyone has to perform." - French poet Artur Rimbaud was born on 20 October, 1854
