Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said plans to revive the Webuye Pan Paper Mills are advanced and it will open soon.He said the mill was to have been revived by August 30, but the investor needed more time to finalise logistics.Lusaka spoke at Webuye Pan Paper stadium on Thursday. &ldquo;I have just toured the factory today and I can assure you that the progress is good. I have seen that a test run for the machines has been done and soon it will be up and running,&rdquo; he said.Lusaka said there has been a lot of anxiety from both leaders and residents, who depend on the mills. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the mill to stall again as happened during the Mwai Kibaki regime. That is why we want them to be given enough time to ensure everything runs smoothly,&rdquo; he said.Lusaka said President Uhuru Kenyatta is only waiting for word from them to commission the mill, any time from today.The governor also dismissed allegations from some Bungoma leaders that the mill was sold at a throwaway price.&ldquo;Because of the good relationship we have had with the Jubilee administration, they have pumped millions into the mills. Issues of politics in this mill are not welcome,&rdquo; Lusaka said. &ldquo;People spread all manner of rumours.&rdquo;
