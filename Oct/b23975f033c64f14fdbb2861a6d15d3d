Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong’o has blamed Governor Jack Ranguma for low revenue collection. Nyong’o said Kisumu town alone collected around Sh1 billion when Ranguma took office in 2013 and the collection should have increased to around Sh 1.5 billion. Speaking in Kibos on Friday, he said the county currently collects Sh800 million annually, compared to Meru’s Sh3 billion. The senator faulted the county government for not having a city management board and director to run the city and get more revenue. Nyong’o is eyeing the governor position. He said it is time he came back to the county to improve revenue and spur development. Nyong’o said he must come back to Kisumu and do what he did when he was Planning minister, to revive the county’s economy. He said he introduced an economic recovery strategy for wealth and job creation. Nyong’o said Kisumu residents must work together to save the county.
