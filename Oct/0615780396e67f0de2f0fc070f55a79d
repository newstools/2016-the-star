He said the programme was also started to ease parents burden of paying for mid-term and end of term examinations.Wairia said withdrawing the tests would be a setback for the sector, citing tremendous improvement over the past two years."Schools in the county used to conduct over 30 different exams before we came up with the harmonised county test," Wairia said.

"These examinations have provided a platform for fair competition among schools," he said at Kangema town on Monday.The governor reiterated that the ban would affect students from poor backgrounds who are normally sent home for failing to raise examination fees."The county government has not sponsored the exams as a campaign tool," the governor said.The programme, he said, saves parents an average of Sh70 million annually.There was confusion in schools last week after head teachers failed to administer end of term examinations that were distributed by the county government. The institutions cited the circular released by the ministry of education barring the exercise.The governor said the issue should be resolved urgently to ensure learning is not disrupted in schools.
