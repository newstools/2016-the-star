Drought and famine continue to ravage the people of Samburu county, even as maize meant for relief food has been at the Maralal cereals depot for two weeks.Depot manager Sammy Kipng'etich said, "We are only waiting for the county to prepare their logistics and come to collect the maize. It has been here for two weeks."The Star established that families in Samburu East spend their days along the roads with the hope that a vehicle delivering relief food will pass by and they will get food.Samburu East deputy county commissioner Winston Mulubi said, "As you drive along the Wamba-Maralal and Isiolo-Wamba roads, you will notice a lot of malnutritioned women in the bushes trying to get wild fruits and seeds. This is all they can afford to eat."They also feed their livestock on the wild fruits and seeds they gather.Villages are deserted as most families have moved with their livestock to neighbouring counties of Isiolo and Laikipia in search of water and pasture.Drought has ravaged many counties in Kenya and 1.3 million people face starvation.The Samburu government had earlier announced that starving families in the northern and eastern parts of Samburu will start receiving relief food. However, distribution teams have not delivered the food to starving residents.Some 10,000 bags of maize have been received at the Maralal National Cereals and Produce Board depot. The maize is part of 20,000 bags expected to be brought at the depot for emergency food.The Sh11 million stock is said to be an order made by the county government.The cereals board is repackaging the maize into 50kg bags as it waits for the distribution and famine monitoring teams to collect it.Kipng'etich said officers from the Health department in Samburu visited the depot to inspect the maize and ascertain if it is good for human consumption.The county government is said to be planning to start the distribution of relief food to the affected families anytime from today.The relief food will be distributed in Wamba and Baragoi the most affected areas.Four weeks ago, the National Drought Management Authority and teh Samburu government had assessed the drought situation and said that approximately 54,000 residents were at risk of starvation.The number is said to have increased.During the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town on October 20, Samburu county commissioner Mohamed Birik assured residents that the national government had sent emergency relief food to the county.He said the county had received 600 bags of maize, 300 bags of rice, 300 bags of beans and 150 cartons of cooking oil.Women also walk long distances in search of water.Elizabeth Nasieku, a mother of six, told the Star she sets out in the wee hours of the morning to the river carrying a 20-litre jerrican and her three-year-old son, a journey that may take the whole day to and fro.Most residents go to the bush or the nearest river Nagor Oworu, about 25-30 kilometres away.Nasieku said they sometimes queue for three to four hours by the river as pastoralists from various areas water their livestock, before they are allowed to draw water.
