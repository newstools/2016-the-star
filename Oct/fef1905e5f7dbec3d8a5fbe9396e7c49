The state will spend an additional Sh54 billion on the teachers pay rise within the next five years, starting July 1, 2017.The new figure, agreed by the TSC and teachers unions Knut and Kuppet on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, increases the annual wage bill for teachers salaries. The current wage bill is Sh162 billion 23 per cent of the national wage bill.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion yesterday said the unions and the Teacher s Service Commission expect to register the collective bargaining agreement with the Industrial Court within 14 days. Once the CBA is registered, it cautions against non-implementation, Sossion said, and added that it must be within the next five years 2017 to 2021.On June 30, 2015, Justice Nduma Nderi of the Industrial Court directed the TSC to pay teachers enhanced basic salaries for the period of July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2017, in a 50-60 per cent award.The TSC objected to the award and moved to the Court of Appeal, arguing the government would require an additional Sh73 billion to pay the increase for the four-year period.
