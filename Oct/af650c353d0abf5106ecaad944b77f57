Six primary school pupils are being held at Keringet police station in Nakuru county following a riot in which desks and blackboards were destroyed.The boys from Mwahe Primary School are said to have been protesting the alleged defilement of a class 8 girl by a teacher."We have taken them to the station to help police with investigations on what prompted the incident," said an officer who sought anonymity.The girl's parent said his daughter revealed that a teacher defiled her in the head teacher's office one evening."My child was defiled but security, together with the school management, want to conceal the issue," the parent said on Thursday.He said the girl was coached by the teacher to lie to medics that she was menstruating, so that she is not tested.The parents said they recorded statements with the police.A village elder, Joseph Rotich, said the PTA chair was present at the school when the incident occurred.Joseph said the chair saw the teacher with two girls at the head teacher's office."Pupils reveal that defilement has been taking place at the school so we urge relevant government office to investigate these incidents," he said.The school's deputy head teacher Mathew Mutai said he did not know why the accused was arrested only to be released later.When probed by the Star, the teacher denied defiling the pupil."I am innocent. I am sure [these claims are by] parents who have been planning evil against me," he said.
