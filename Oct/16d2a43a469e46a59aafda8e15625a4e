Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has been taken to court for overstepping his mandate and usurping President Uhuru Kenyatta s powers in dissolving the NGOs Coordination Board. The board and its embattled executive director Fazul Mohamed, whom Kiunjuri suspended, want the court to halt the dissolution, pending the determination of their case.The board in its suit papers says that according to the law, only the President has the power to appoint or remove its members. The actions of the 1st respondent [Kiunjuri] are tantamount to a breach of the Constitution, a violation of the applicant s constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms and are an affront to justice, the suit papers state.The board argues that the decision by the CS amounts to abuse of office and it is a collateral attack over perceived issues regarding the commencement and implementation of the Public Benefits Organisations Act.The CS did not take the principle of fair administrative action into consideration and did not give Mohamed an opportunity to be heard, it says.Kiunjuri dissolved the board a day after the governing council linked him to a Sh20 million bribe.He suspended Mohamed pending investigations on allegations that he is not qualified for the post.Egerton University disowned the embattled executive director s degree in November last year.Academic Affairs registrar Seth Owido said Mahamed Yusuf, as he was known in college, was discontinued in his third year on academic grounds on August 26, 2010.In a letter to the National Council of NGOs on September 10, the professor said Mohamed was admitted as a regular student in 2007. He was discontinued for failing 50 per cent or more of all the credit factors of one academic year, Owido said.But the executive director s CV shows he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry degree in 2009.
