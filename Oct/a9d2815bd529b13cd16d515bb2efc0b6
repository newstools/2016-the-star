Small-scale traders in Kiambu could soon access bank loans without strict requirements if a bill tabled by Senator Kimani Wamatangi is passed.The Micro and Small Enterprises (Amendment) Bill will see the traders trained on how to run their businesses and apply for loans from banks, the government and other lenders.The bill seeks to compel the government and financial institutions to recognise small traders as genuine businesspeople.The existing micro and small enterprise law does not recognise some small traders including hawkers, fishmongers and sand harvesters. The government does not sponsor their training at the Micro and Small Enterprises Authority.Wamatangi yesterday said the bill seeks to improve the welfare of the small traders.He wants the term &ldquo;micro enterprise&rdquo; to include the informal sector.&ldquo;Hawkers have gotten used to being chased away from the streets, maimed and arrested by the county askaris. This issue has got to the point that no one sees them as reliable. They need to be recognised like any other businessperson,&rdquo; Wamatangi said.
