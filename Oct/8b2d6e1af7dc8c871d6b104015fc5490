We were told the groups were split into three with one group arriving at the foot of the mountain on time and the others after midnight, he said.Ndung'u said the search was launched after they had waited too long for missing people. My daughter is an avid hiker and has been involved in other exercises. We were not sure what happened but hoped for the best, he said.Munyaka Njiru, Director, Bucketlist Travels said: We would like to thank everyone that took part in the search and rescue operations that began on Saturday as soon as we learnt about this ordeal. Special mentions goes out to the Kenya Police, Kenya Wildlife Service and more than 50 area local residents that turned up in the foot and rescue operation mission that has been taking place since Saturday. Kipipiri OCPD Wilson Rotich said that the four were reported missing on Sunday after efforts to find them bore no fruit.Rotich said they mobilised officers from Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and police units, and local guides for the operation.He said they carried out searches from the air and on the ground.A local who declined to be named blamed Buckrest saying it hired untrained locals to guide the hikers. Some of the guides are not conversant with the forest, he said, adding the thick terrain and poor visibility by search teams made lengthened the search.
