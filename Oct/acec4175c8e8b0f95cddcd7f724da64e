Thika residents have called for the closure of the Kang oki dumpsite, saying it is a health hazard.Residents from Muthaiga, Kamenu and Kiganjo estates met MCA Elizabeth Muthoni on Tuesday. They said toxic smoke and an unpleasant odour emanate from the dumpsite. The residents alleged the fumes have caused the deaths of 10 infants in a month.They said people burn waste at night, putting expectant women s health at risk. We are tired of burying our children and losing babies to the hazardous smoke and foul smell coming from the dumpsite. We are not spared either, because most residents complain of chest pains and headaches, all because of the smoke, community leader Peninah Wambui said. She said their homes are infested with flies from the dumpsite. The residents accused the county of laxity. They said county workers dump waste in their compounds. We want the county to show us the boundary between residential areas and the dumpsite. Since 2013 they have been pushing waste to our homes and now it has become too much, Wambui said.Environment executive Esther Njuguna denied the allegations, and said she will investigate.
