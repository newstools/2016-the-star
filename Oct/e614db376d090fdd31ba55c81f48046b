Wednesday s win by the Jubilee Party in Sala ward, Tana River county, should be a wake-up call for Cord, Bura MP Ali Wario has said.He addressed hundreds of Jubilee supporters on Wednesday night at Hatata Primary School in Mororo, Bura. Wario said the win is a sign of what Cord should expect at next year s election.During the by-election, Jubilee s 26-year-old Fauzia Sadik trounced her three opponents by a big margin. She garnered 1,184 votes. Her closest rival Ibrahim Ware managed a paltry 210 votes. Wiper s Mchiru Ibrahim got 200, while ODM s Mohamed Guracha came in last with 96 votes. The win has given us the confidence to popularise JP, whose main agenda is to unite residents and better their lives, Wario said.He said Fauzia s election as the first JP MCA in Tana River indicates clearly that residents have matured and are not interested in confrontational politics driven by selfish interests, with no agenda for the common mwananchi .The legislator urged Fauzia to work with her opponents, saying they remain leaders, despite losing at the polls. These are our brothers and sisters, including those who voted for them. We should unite and bring development to our people. That is the bottom line, Wario added. Fauzia thanked voters for electing her, despite her gender and youth. She urged her rivals to join her in developing the ward.
