Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said he &ldquo;is not dreaming&rdquo; of being Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s running mate.Joho yesterday refuted claims his recent focus on party business is a way of ensuring he gets the deputy president candidate slot. He said he will seek reelection as governor.Joho said he is only Raila&rsquo;s frontman and foot soldier, keen on ensuring he gets to State House. Speaking in Likoni when he launched three projects, he said, &ldquo;I do not want to be Raila&rsquo;s running mate. I&rsquo;m waiting for 2022 when I will battle it out for the national top seat.&rdquo;Joho&rsquo;s star has been rising, not only in Mombasa, but in Raila&rsquo;s Nyanza backyard.Several youths and ODM leaders have endorsed Joho as Raila&rsquo;s running mate due to his loyalty and focus on sending Jubilee leaders home. Joho said his focus is moving across the country to popularise ODM and ensure that Raila unseats President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;I have confidence I will retain my seat in Mombasa, so there is no point to campaign there. I want to focus on spearheading presidential campaigns across the country,&rdquo; he said. Joho has led ODM rallies in Mombasa and Nairobi in the past few weeks. Last weekend, he was Kisumu to popularise the party. The three Cord co-principals are fighting to be the flagbearer.
