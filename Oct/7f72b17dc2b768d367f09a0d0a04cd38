Many people who have stopped abusing alcohol and narcotics suffer from rejection in society, an agency, Hope for the Family, has said.Chairperson Hellen Gichuki said such people need psychological support because some discover they ruined their lives. Speaking on Wednesday at Kwambira market in Limuru subcounty, she urged society to accept them back so they can recover. Gichuki led a group of 25 former alcoholics in cleaning up the market in preparation for the Mashujaa Day celebrations.The former drunkards said their families never took them seriously when they quit taking alcohol. Maryanne Nyambura, who has been taking illicit brew for more than 10 years, said society looks down upon them. Families must demonstrate they have accepted back their members for society to follow suit. This helps in completing rehabilitation, Gichuki said.
