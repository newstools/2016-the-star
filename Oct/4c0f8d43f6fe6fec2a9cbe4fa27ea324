What then is the message to ordinary Kenyans? That they should learn to live with corruption, which takes away their livelihoods?&rdquo;Top civil society actors and some ODM leaders censured the President for allegedly singling out Ouko.&ldquo;It was in extreme bad taste and most uncivil for the President to single out the Auditor General for a tongue-lashing in public. It smacks of dictatorship,&rdquo; ODM secretary for Political Affairs Opiyo Wandayi said. He urged the President to resign before the party considers impeaching him.Civil Society Reference Group coordinator Suba Churchill said Uhuru&rsquo;s doublespeak on graft became apparent when he took on Ouko who &ldquo;continuously does a commendable job&rdquo;.&ldquo;Instead of focusing on the failings of the EACC, which is used to protect certain individuals that are regarded as sacred cows, or focusing on the DPP, which again has largely failed, he [Uhuru] focused on the Auditor General,&rdquo; he said.Though he blasted Ouko in his address, Uhuru did not spare the other agencies and strongly criticised the EACC, the DPP, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the judiciary.More on this: 'Cry baby' Uhuru faces KOT wrath after corruption frustration
