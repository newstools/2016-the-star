MPs confronted Kago with a trail of transactions worth Sh346 million wired through his account between January and April 2015.Kago received Sh130 million from Gethi and Sh156 from Kabura through his account at KCB and Family Bank.However, he acknowledged only receiving Sh60 million from Kabura as &lsquo;soft-loan&rsquo; to expand his business.
