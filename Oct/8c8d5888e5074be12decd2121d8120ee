The Kenya Private Sector Alliance yesterday told a Senate committee governors should not be allowed to manage roads under the Kenya Urban Roads Authority.Kepsa, which submitted its proposed amendments and recommendations on the Roads Bill 2015, opposed the proposed disbandment of Kura. Governors insist the bill is unconstitutional. The disbandment of Kura will hurt development of roads in urban areas. The potential of conflict between the national and county governments in management of urban roads may result in some roads being underdeveloped, Matu Mwangi, Kepsa Transport Board member, told the committee chaired by Nominated Senator Judith Sijeny.He said tasking county governments with the management of key urban roads may lead to non-prioritisation of some roads due to competing priorities. For us it does not matter who builds the roads. All we want are good roads that will let us transport goods to the market, Mwangi said.He said the county governments should be doing a complementary role, rather than fighting for the roads .While the Constitution says the national government manages national trunk roads and the counties maintain county roads, the bill has introduced three classes of roads primary national trunk roads, secondary national trunk roads and county roads.It also seeks to establish parastatals the Kenya National Highways Authority and the Kenya National Secondary Roads Authority, which will oversee construction and maintenance of primary and secondary roads.The bill also introduces a county roads agency as either a department or division, which will be responsible for the management, development and maintenance of county roads under the county executive.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya said the bill is unconstitutional as the law does not provide for national secondary categorisation of roads .He said the county governments have the power to classify and assign county roads within their jurisdiction and submit their classifications for inventory. Munya was accompanied by governors Isaac Rutto (Bomet), John Mruttu (Taita Taveta), Kinuthia Mbugua (Nakuru) and Salim Mvurya (Kwale).
