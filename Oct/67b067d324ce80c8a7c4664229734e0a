Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia has said his government will continue administering exams despite a ban by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i.He said he launched the free county exams programme in 2014 to improve dwindling education standards and standardise performance across the county.Wairia said the programme also aimed to ease parents burden of paying for mid-term and end-term exams.He said withdrawing the exams would be a setback because there has been a "tremendous improvement" for the two years the programme has been operational. Schools used to sit more than 30 exams before we came up with the harmonised county exam, the governor said.He said the programme has made it possible to monitor schools lagging behind and come up with measures of improving performance.Wairia said the county logo will remain on the exam papers. These exams have provided a platform for fair competition among schools and have improved the county's overall performance, he said.Speaking at Kangema town, Wairia said the ban would affect students from poor backgrounds who used to be sent home frequently for not paying exam fees.He said the county government did not sponsor the exams as a campaign tool.Wairia said the exams save parents an average of Sh70 million annually.There was confusion in schools last week after head teachers failed to administer end of term exams distributed by the county government, citing the circular released by the Education ministry.The governor said the issue should be resolved urgently to ensure learning is not disrupted.Murang a county director of education Leonard Kirimi said they received the circular two weeks ago indicating that they should not carry out county sponsored exams as it is a function of the national government.
