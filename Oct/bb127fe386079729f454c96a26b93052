British American Tobacco yesterday told the Court of Appeal that Kenya risks losing more than Sh57 billion in revenue in the next five years, thanks to the new tobacco rules.The giant cigarette manufacturer said a further 80,000 people risk losing their jobs as a result of the Tobacco Control Act 2014.The regulations by Parliamentary House Committee on Health, among other things, govern advertising for tobacco products as well as the size of health warnings on cigarette packages. In submissions made by BAT's lawyer Peter Kiragu before appellant judges Festus Azangalala, Hannah Okwengu and Fatima Sichale, he said the Nairobi-based factory manufactures cigarettes for 17 countries. Kiragu said it will be a great loss for Kenya if the regulations are upheld. The lawyer said there are more than 100,000 small and medium size enterprises who trade in tobacco across the country, and they risk being pushed out of business.Kiragu said there was no public participation as BAT was not consulted on the new regulations. The cost of complying with the regulations is enormous, and risks shutting down businesses. The regulations constitute unnecessary restriction, which goes beyond known principles of tobacco control, the lawyer said.Kiragu said Health Cabinet Secretary's input in the new regulation is not in accordance with the constitution."For any act to be legal, it must be in accordance with the law of the land, which has not been followed in the new Act," the counsel said. He said it is unfair to implement the Act, while sugar consumption and alcohol are the major killers in the country, yet there are no regulations governing the two commodities."The court should interrogate the process that was used to come up with the TCA 2007," Kiragu said."We are not opposed to the regulation of the industry. But what we are saying is that any Act needs to be in line with the constitution, balanced, and evidence based, intended to achieve public health objectives."Kiragu faulted a High Court judgment delivered by Justice Mumbi Ngugi on March 25 this year. Her decision allowed the regulations passed by Parliament seeking to control the manufacture, sale and advertising of tobacco products.Ngugi said the law should take effect six months from the date of the judgment.In defence, the Ministry of Health through lawyer Mohamed Adow said the Act is in line with the constitution.Judge Okwengu extended a stay on the implementation of the regulations until the judgment is delivered on December 16.
