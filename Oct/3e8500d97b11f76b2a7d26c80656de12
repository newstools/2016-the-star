ODM has discharged six rebel MPs from parliamentary committees in the latest attempt by the Orange party to instil discipline among members.The party cracked the whip yesterday recalling the legislators said to have too cozy a working relationship with the ruling Jubilee Party ahead of the next polls.The party de-whipped former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba from three committees. Namwamba is now the LPK chairman.The Budalang i lawmaker was discharged from the Budget and Appropriations Committee, the Committee of Administration and National Security and the Constitution Implementation Oversight and Implementation Committee.Also discharged from various committees were Karachuonyo MP James Rege from the Committees of Energy, Equal Opportunity and National Cohesion; Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi who was recalled from the committees of Energy and Lands; and Mathare MP Steven Kariuki from the committees of Education, Constitution Oversight and Implementation. Others removed are Kubai Iringo (Imenti Central) from the committees of Finance and Regional Integration; Isaac Mwaura (nominated MP) from the committees of Environment and House Procedure; John Waluke (Sirisia) from the committees of National Security and Delegated Legislation.But Waluke dared ODM to go ahead and delete his name from the party membership register to occasion a by-election. ODM did not bring me to Parliament. I was elected by the honourable people of Sirisia. It is unfair for the party to deny me my constitutional right to represent the people of Sirisia, he said, moments after the discharge.Kubai accused ODM of being ungrateful to him for delivering the Imenti Central seat, saying he is very popular and would beat the party any time elections are called. If this is the way ODM is going, it will shrink, shrink and collapse, he said.
