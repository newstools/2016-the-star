A caller on a radio talk show recently pointed out how employers are increasingly resorting to psychological assessment of employees and of potential hires, over and above looking at their educational or experiential qualifications.Human resource people will tell you that because hiring and training new staff is expensive, it is necessary to ensure employees are the right fit for the job before taking them on. Such testing is on the rise and is probably happening in an organisation near you. The tests tell employers what they need to know about an employee, be they current or potential, and not just what the employee wants to share with them.The caller to the station suggested that anyone who puts themselves up for public office should also undergo such testing.After weeks of news about the character of US presidential candidates at debates, a Nairobi politician declaring himself acting President, and political battles in South Africa over the presidency, I am starting to think some sort of psychometric testing for leaders isn t such a bad idea.In fact, one way or another, political parties all claim to have some sort of selection process in place; it just needs a bit of work for most of them. So for instance, if you want to become an MP, you should have to apply to your party of choice two to three years before the next election, and submit yourself to some sort of interview board set up by the constituency branch. The board would put prospective candidates through written and oral tests to see if they are suitable. Before the tests, such candidates would have been assessed to see how involved they are in their local communities. Are they, for instance, involved with a school board or any other matters of concern to the community? Such involvement must not be limited to how much money they have contributed at fundraisers but should examine just how willing they are to roll up their sleeves and actually work with the community on a practical level.This sort of testing, if adopted by all political parties and enforced by law, would weed out most, but probably not all, of the unsuitable types we end up electing to office. It would force people to think realistically about the role of a leader, from councillor to MP to senator to governor to President, and perhaps then, we would have a better quality of leader to choose from at the ballot.It would also put an end to the madness we see just before an election, with some candidates suddenly trying to buy their way into office and others setting up briefcase political parties for sale to the highest bidder.
