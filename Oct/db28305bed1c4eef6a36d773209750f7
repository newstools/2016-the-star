Cord leader Raila Odinga has dared the Jubilee government to arrest Auditor General Edward Ouko for allegedly failing to account for Sh100 million his office used to buy office equipment.Raila accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of trying to fan a case against Ouko, and said he will not succeed.He said the opposition will call countrywide demonstrations like what happened in Brazil if Ouko is prosecuted.Raila spoke at Nyacheki market yesterday, when he drummed up support for ODM candidate Naftal Onkoba in the Nyacheki MCA by-election. Former MCA Peter Ongeri died in July, creating the vacancy.On the government s plan to bar Ouko from travelling to the US to investigate how Sh215 billion of the Eurobond cash was spent, Raila said Ouko is an independent official. The President must understand the staff at the Office of the Auditor General do not need his permission to perform their duties, he said.Raila told Uhuru to resign because he admitted to being unable to fight graft during Governance and Accountability Summit at State House, Nairobi, last week. He said if elected, he will deal with all the ills the previous governments have committed which have denied Kenyans the right to access proper services . Raila urged residents to vote for Onkoba during the by-election slated for tomorrow.He said Onkoba will work with ODM to provide services and implement projects launched by Ongeri.Uhuru on Sunday called for dialogue to weed out corruption and address tribal conflicts.Speaking on behalf of the President, spokesperson Manoah Esipisu urged Kenyans to use dialogue to address corruption. Dialogue has a premium place in this administration and we are pleased that the State House corruption and governance summit was successful, Esipisu said in his weekly State House briefing.
