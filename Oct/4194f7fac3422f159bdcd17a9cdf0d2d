Mwingi police station was a flurry of activities on Saturday, as goons and supporters of two MP aspirants flocked there from 11am to 6pm. Former LSK boss Erick Mutua (pictured) arrived at the station to report that his life is in danger. He said his convoy was attacked by supporters of an opponent at Maai on Friday night. One wonders why the two policemen and an officer from NSIS did nothing, Mutua said. He said former PS Gideon Mulyungi s team blocked a bridge, but police officers offered them security instead ofarresting them.Mulyungi showed up at the station moments after Mutua left to record a statement too. He said his supporters were attacked by Mutua s. Mulyungi said Mutua has defrauded residents whose cases he has handled keeping the compensation money awarded by courts. The politicians supporters nearly clashed but were stopped by residents and officers. The officers armed themselves with rungus and teargas canisters but did not use them. The two have aligned themselves with Wiper, creating a headache for party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Elected leaders were caught up in the chaos. I was roughed up by police and other goons. I was kicked and whipped, but as a leader I will not revenge. We need peaceful campaigns, Mwingi Central MCA Bernard Mwangangi, alias Sila, said. The MCA was allegedly attacked by police and some goons as they approached the station. Mwingi police boss Gerald Baraza said he will not comment. He told journalists to write what they had seen and heard.
