Forty Ethiopians of Oromo origin were charged on Monday with taking part in an unlawful assembly. The group rounded up at City Park in Nairobi on Sunday evening was arraigned before Kibera senior principal magistrate Elizabeth Juma on Monday.They were arrested while protesting against their government, following clashes that have left at least 50 dead.But their lawyer Stanley Kang'ahi told the court they attended the Oromo prayer feast, which he noted was legal as they had paid Nairobi City County. He said they had receipts.Kang'ahi also said they held a similar event at the same venue a few years ago, and that most of those arrested were observers who got caught in unfortunate circumstances.Seven of them were charged separately with being in Kenya illegally.The lawyer said one of them had a genuine refugee ID card but that it got lost and the matter reported at Shauri Moyo police station.Kang'ahi said the six fled from the country in the wake of the violence and were seeking refugee status in Kenya.He said they could not go back as this would put their lives in danger.State counsel Angela Okallo said none of the accused told police they were attending a feast, and that they only received reports of riots.Okallo also said those who fled should have been at a refugee camp following up on their papers, not roaming around without proper documents.Juma released all the others on Sh 50,000 bond each and a surety of the same amount.She ordered the preparation of a pre-bail report for six of those charged with being in the country without proper documents.The case will be mentioned on October 17, for the report to be tabled, and heard on January 17, 2017.The Oromo community, which is Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, has been protesting against government plans to reallocate farmland.Plans to allocate land surrounding the capital for development prompted fierce demonstrations in November and spread for months, in the country's worst unrest in more than a decade.Ethiopia has long been one of the world's poorest nations but has industrialised rapidly in the past decade. But reallocating land is a thorny issue for Ethiopians, many of whom are subsistence farmers.Protests in the country on Sunday saw more than 50 people killed in a stampede in Oromiya region, triggered when police used teargas and shot in the air to disperse anti-government protesters at a religious festival.The state broadcaster put the death toll at 52, citing regional officials. The opposition also said at least 50 people were killed at the annual festival where some people had chanted slogans against the government and waved a rebel group's flag.Sporadic protests have erupted in Oromiya in the last two years, initially sparked by a land row but increasingly turning more broadly against the government. Since late 2015, scores of protesters have been killed in clashes with police.Read: Deadly stampede in Ethiopia as police fire at anti-government protestersAlso read: Ethiopia's silver medalist Feyisa Lilesa makes protest gesture at marathon finish
