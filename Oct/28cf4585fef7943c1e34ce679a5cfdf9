Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has accused MCAs in Cord strongholds of being compromised by governors. He asked why the only governor impeachments forwarded to the Senate are from Jubilee strongholds.&ldquo;It means MCAs in Jubilee areas seem to have understood their role of oversight better than their Cord counterparts,&rdquo; Khalwale said.He spoke on Citizen TV&rsquo;s breakfast show Cheche yesterday. Khalwale was with his counterparts Kimani Wamatangi of Kiambu, Stephen Sang of Nandi and Mombasa&rsquo;s Hassan Omar.Wamatangi accused the judiciary of interfering with the impeachment process. Sang said the motion to impeach Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero tabled on Tuesday is suspicious as it is based on issues that took place in 2013.&ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; he asked. But Omar said an impeachment can take place any time.
