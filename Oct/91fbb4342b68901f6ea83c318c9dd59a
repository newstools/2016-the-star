Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has dismissed allegations that the county government set aside Sh34 million for tea and mandazi as reported in the media.Speaking in his office yesterday, he said the Sh34 million was the whole budget for hospitality supplies and services in various departments.&ldquo;There is nowhere in the hospitality analysis that shows the funds were meant to buy tea and mandazi," he said.The governor showed documents with the hospitality analysis which had a breakdown of how the funds were allocated.It emerged that the allocation was budgeted for catering services (reception), accommodation, gifts, food and drinks.The county also set aside the funds for boards, committees, conferences, seminars, purchasing of coffins, board allowances and donations.As per the document, the county assembly was allocated Sh6.9 million, while the executive was allocated Sh8.9 million.Other departments that received allocations include the Public Service Board that received Sh1.1 million, Finance Department Sh2.6 million and Agriculture was allocated Sh946,957.The Lands department got Sh923,500 and Education received Sh850,000.At the same time the county set aside Sh1.5 million for the Health department, Sh2.2 million for Trade, Sh8.1 million for ICT and Sh623,000 for Fisheries.&ldquo;The office of the governor and deputy governor received an estimated Sh9 million. We normally entertain high profile and top dignitaries," Timamy said.He accused his rivals of spreading propaganda about the Sh3.4 million to create a bad picture of him and his administration.
