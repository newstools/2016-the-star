Wiper leaders have warned that the party's members who are implicated in corruption will be denied nomination certificates during the 2017 polls.The party further challenged other political movements to isolate corrupt officials from leadership positions as part of their effort to fight graft.Secretary general Hassan Omar said wiper would not only ensure corrupt officials do not get a place in the party but also push for their trial and arrest."Wiper has a code of conduct that will not allow land grabbers, corrupt officials and other people stealing from Kenyans to receive nomination certificates," said Omar."We will not work with any corrupt leader. Wiper will ensure the law is followed and those implicated in graft are arrested and jailed should we take over power," he said.The Mombasa Senator said that Jubilee has failed to address corruption in the country and Kenyans should take the responsibility by finding solutions to end the vice.He challenged other institutions to follow suit irrespective of their areas of operation, further indicating that they will take the campaign to a national level."We will compel our supporters not to allow corrupt officials to take leadership positions in the country," he said.Kitui senator David Musila said corruption had denied millions of Kenyans opportunities to grow as well as compromised service delivery within the public service."We will not witch-hunt anyone but we have strong structures in the party to ensure only people with integrity ascend to power," said Musila.Wiper's call comes in the wake of state agencies, whose mandate is to tackle corruption, engaging in blame games on the matter.This emerged on Tuesday at the State House's accountability and governance summit.President Uhuru Kenyatta wants those raising the red flag on graft to present evidence that will help in prosecution of the implicated individuals.But the Opposition insists that the Jubilee Administration has failed to stop the vice, further asking Uhuru and DP William Ruto to take responsibility.Read: Vote out desperate Jubilee, MP Bosire says on Uhuru corruption speech
