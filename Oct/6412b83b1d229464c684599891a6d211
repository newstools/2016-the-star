A South Coast hotelier yesterday urged the Kwale government to provide fresh water for hotels.Most hotels depend on salty borehole water and their owners say it is corroding their pipes and properties, making it expensive to maintain their investments. Governor Salim Mvurya s administration has done a lot for tourism in Kwale and we are sure he can help us get fresh water, Diani Beach Resort Hotel and Spa CEO Titus Kangangi said.He spoke to journalists yesterday at the hotel. Kangangi said they also want beach operators relocated, saying they harass tourists. We want them placed in areas where tourists can go and do their shopping, Kangangi said. He also asked the county to market tourism.
