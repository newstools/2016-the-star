ODM is the party of choice in Kisii and I will do everything possible to ensure leader Hon Raila Odinga gets the support he needs in the region.&rdquo;Bosire said the success of the by-election has proved that Raila will unseat President Uhuru Kenyatta in the general election and bring change and development.&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s win is an indication that ODM and the Cord fraternity are heading in the right direction,&rdquo; he said.Ong&rsquo;era and Chae said the outcome of three by-elections is an indication that Kenyans are tired of poor leadership.ODM also won three ward by-elections out of four held on Wednesday. They won in Nyacheki, Kalokol in Turkana and Mosiro in Kajiado. Jubilee won in Sala ward, Tana River county. The Nyacheki by-election is a blow to a caucus fronting for Kisii unity which campaigned for the Jubilee candidate. The group of nine legislators led by Senator Chris Obure and Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi pitched camp in the ward.Jubilee rejects resultsHowever, Jubilee rejected the outcome of the election. &ldquo;On behalf of Jubilee Party we wish to state that the Nyacheki ward by-election carried out yesterday was marred by serious irregularities involving vote buying, insecurity and blatant disregard of etiquette and civility of the electoral process,&rdquo; said Albert Nyaundi who sent the statement on behalf of Jubilee.&ldquo;We are not conceding defeat in the by-election and will take legal action to have the results nullified. Jubilee is a party of peace and would like to take this opportunity to ask our political opponents to think about our beautiful country Kenya and stem this electoral thuggery even as we are heading to a general election in a few months.&rdquo;Jubilee candidate Magoma, who came second, also dismissed the results, saying the polls were marred by malpractices. &ldquo;I cannot give the by-election a clean bill,&rdquo; he said.Hired ODM youths caused chaos in a number of polling stations and scared his supporters from voting, Magoma said.
