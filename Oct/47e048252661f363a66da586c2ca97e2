Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he has no issue with politicians who defected to the recently formed Jubilee Party.Speaking at the Mashujaa Day celebrations on Thursday, Kalonzo called for peaceful politics as the country nears the 2017 general elections. We have no issue with those who defected to Jubilee including our host today, Governor Alfred Mutua. All I can say is that nobody should be surprised when leaders go home for forsaking their people, he said.Kalonzo had in September warned Wiper-affiliated leaders who decamped to Jubilee party to brace themselves for by-elections.Read: Stop threatening defectors with by-elections, MPs tell CordThe leaders are MP's Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central),North), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), John Munuve (Mwingi ), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Richard Makenga (Kaiti).Thirty-five MPs and five governors from the opposition decamped to President Uhuru Kenyatta's party during its launch in September.More on this: [VIDEO] Jubilee to receive five Cord governors , 35 MPs on SaturdayKalonzo also proposed for the renaming of Mashujaa day to 'Constitutional and Heroes Day'."I would propose we consolidate Mashujaa day with with Constitutional day to celebrate everyone who has made an impact on this great country, he said.He expressed confidence in being the Cord coalition flagbearer to challenge Uhuru in the 2017 polls.
