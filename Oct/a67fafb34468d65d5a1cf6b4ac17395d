Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has said his rivals are &ldquo;rejects&rdquo; unworthy of his position.He urged residents to reelect him because his rivals &ldquo;have nothing to offer the county.&rdquo; Awiti said he launched projects long before taking up the governor&rsquo;s seat.&ldquo;I am trusted because of my good development record which I started before the inception of devolution. Those people who want to unseat me must first prove they are worth being elected,&rdquo; he said.Awiti spoke on Friday during a fundraiser for Siany Mixed Secondary School in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. MP Sylvance Osele was present. Awiti said, &ldquo;Some of these people have retired from the civil service, while others have been in politics for more than 10 years. We expected them to quit leadership but they still want to jump into the governor&rsquo;s seat.&rdquo; He said he will solve residents&rsquo; problems if reelected. He urged residents to collect their ID cards. &ldquo;Our people have an opportunity to choose good leadership through voting, which cannot be done without the IDs, so go pick them up,&rdquo; Awiti said.Osele urged residents to vote for leaders who have launched projects. He urged residents to collect their ID cards, adding that he will traverse the county to educate them on the importance of voting.&ldquo;Cord wants to wrestle Jubilee out of power and to do that, it needs votes. I want to urge the youth to get their IDs and voters&rsquo; cards and elect Cord,&rdquo; Osele said. Four people have declared their interest in the governor&rsquo;s position. They include businessmen Sammy Wakiaga, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, Enos Bolo and Cosmas Kanyadudi.Magwanga is a strong critic of Awiti&rsquo;s leadership, accusing him of failing to launch projects.On Thursday last week, Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata urged the youth to reelect Awiti. He said the decision of who should lead the county should be issue-based, not a matter of &ldquo;gambling&rdquo;.
