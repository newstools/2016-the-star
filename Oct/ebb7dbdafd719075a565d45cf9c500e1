A police officer convicted of defiling and impregnating 13-year old girl in 2010 has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.Joseph Mutua, an AP officer based in Laare, was sentenced on Thursday by Maua principal magistrate Oscar Wanyaga. Wanyaga said the prosecution proved beyond doubt that he was guilty."The police officer is meant to have protected the rights of the most vulnerable in society, who are children. I plead with this court to grant justice to the complainant," advocate Muthomi Thiankolu said before the ruling.Thiankolu represented Ripples International which was enjoined tot he case as an interested party.In mitigation before sentencing, the officer said the incident took place six years ago and that he and the victim, now an adult, were living as husband and wife.He said through his lawyer Kirimi Mbogo that he had taken the responsibility of raising the child, and added that dowry negotiations were underway.But the magistrate upheld the initial decision saying was no sufficient proof that the two were living as husband and wife."The complainant says they are living together in Laare but the accused says they are staying together in Mombasa. This is not a matter that can be overlooked," said Wanyanga.Ripples International director Mercy Chidi told the media after the case that the ruling showed nobody is above the law."Justice has been found" she said.Read:Man sentenced to life in jail for defiling girl aged sevenAlso read: Pastor, 60, to serve life sentence for defiling daughter, 16.
