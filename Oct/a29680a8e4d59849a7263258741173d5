Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has been mandated to reach out to other leaders to create the National Super Alliance (NASA) or Muungano Maalum. Party secretary general Godfrey Osotsi said they will work with like-minded leaders "against misrule by Jubilee".Osotsi added that the ruling coalition is "characterised by condoning rampant corruption, a ruinous and extravagant economic model of borrowing, arrogant ethnic exclusionism and ruining our youth with the hustler mentality"."We have mandated the party leader to enhance NASA by setting up the ANC Technical Team of Experts to explore Muungano Maalum with other Kenyan patriots," he said.He spoke on Thursday during the a meeting of Amani's National Elections Committee and Parliamentary Group in Machakos.Mudavadi has been in talks with Cord leader Raila Odinga for the formation of a super alliance to defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party in the next election.Read: We will form 'super alliance' with Cord to defeat Jubilee - MudavadiOsotsi expressed concern about the laxity in meeting deadlines in the Elections Act saying they were aimed at an extension of the August 8, 2017 polls date."Amani National Congress warns that changing the election date will be a monstrous betrayal of the Kenyan people," he said."It should not be allowed because it will be a bonus for those who have been agitating for change of the election date, a wish shared by some in Cord and Jubilee." The party further asked the government to distribute foods in reserves to areas affected by drought and to ensure transparency int he exercise."Millions of Kenyans are facing unmitigated starvation yet the Jubilee government is in denial claiming that the situation is not that dire. If indeed there are stocks of cereals as the government claims, it should not behave as if the drought had not been forecast".Osotsi proposed the single issuance of identification cards for Kenyans saying it it will be cost effective and make the avoidance of irregularities easy."The suggestion that we retrieve the voters register from the Registrar of Persons is extremely appealing. It will save the country billions in the so-called voter registration and eliminate double registration and ghost voters," he said. "Ideally every Kenyan should only have one identity in the form of an identification number for all transactions."During the meeting, Mudavadi received five MPs, a governor and 56 MCAs who joined the party from different parts of the country.
