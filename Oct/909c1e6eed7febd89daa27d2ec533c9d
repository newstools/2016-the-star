Drama at the Nairobi assembly continues to unfold after Majority chief whip David Mberia was kicked out of office on Thursday. The assembly public service board chaired by speaker Alex Magelo locked Mberia&rsquo;s office after a scuffle with majority leader Elias Otieno in the chamber on Tuesday.&ldquo;They are saying they are disciplining me. I disagreed with the majority leader and that is why I have been locked out of my office. They think the office is a favour to me, I don&rsquo;t care, I will serve my party even from the corridors,&rdquo; Mberia said.Mberia and Otieno almost came to blows in the chamber on Tuesday when the impeachment motion against Governor Evans Kidero was being tabled. Mberi has accused Otieno of belittling him and taking over his roles. Speaker Magelo and the majority leader were unavailable for comment.
