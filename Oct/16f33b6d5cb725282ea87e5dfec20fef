County Assemblies Forum secretary general Albert Kochei has welcomed the suggestion by Auditor General Edward Ouko to reduce the number of nominated legislators. &ldquo;It is not logical to have 1,450 elected and 790 nominated MCAs. We need to elect more youth, women and persons with disability,&rdquo; he said at a funeral in Kapkitony, Keiyo South.
