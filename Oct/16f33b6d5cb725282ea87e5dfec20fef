County Assemblies Forum secretary general Albert Kochei has welcomed the suggestion by Auditor General Edward Ouko to reduce the number of nominated legislators. It is not logical to have 1,450 elected and 790 nominated MCAs. We need to elect more youth, women and persons with disability, he said at a funeral in Kapkitony, Keiyo South.
