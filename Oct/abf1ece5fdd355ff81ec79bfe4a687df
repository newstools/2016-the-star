Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka (pictured) yesterday concluded his two-day tour of Nyamira and Kisii counties.He said he stands a better chance to be elected President next year if he is picked the Cord flagbearer. Kalonzo said he has 28 years of experience in the public service I m the best person who can send Jubilee home. I have worked with retired Presidents Moi and Kibaki as the Foreign minister. I also served in other capacities, Kalonzo said. ODM leader Raila Odinga, Moses Wetang ula of Ford Kenya and himself are hoping to be picked Cord s presidential flagbearer.Cord will name its presidential candidate early next year.Kalonzo said he is hopeful Raila and Wetang ula will back him.He said Jubilee should be sent home for failing to address problems affecting Kenyans, among them corruption, tribalism, nepotism and insecurity. They have failed to unite Kenyans. Kenya has 42 tribes but we only hear of only two, he said.Kalonzo spoke when he addressed a leaders meeting at St Vincent Pastoral Centre in Kisii town. He later held rallies at the Kisii bus park and the Daraja Mbili market. He criticised Deputy President William Ruto for allegedly using corruptly acquired money to woo opposition MPs. He is using the Eurobond money to woo opposition members. Recently, I handed over five MPs from Ukambani to Jubilee. We are not swayed by the move, Kalonzo said.As the Wiper leader drummed up support for himself, Raila was in Nyacheki ward, where he campaigned for the party s candidate in tomorrow s by-election.
