The Council of Governors wants the pending Impeachment Procedure Bill 2016 to be similar to the process of impeaching the President.Chairman Peter Munya (pictured) said the people elect governors; therefore any impeachment attempt must follow a similar process to that of the President. He said the impeachment motions against various governors have been messy. Hence, the bill must address any loopholes in the current process. Munya, who is the Meru governor, reiterated that the bill must follow the procedure of impeaching the President. The bill provides a framework for removing public officers, including the President, Deputy President, Cabinet Secretaries, governors, deputy governors and MCAs. He asked the National Assembly and Senate to ensure the impeachment of governors is above board. We have to make sure that due process is followed in case a governor faces an impeachment motion. This will see justice done to the governor being impeached, Munya said.He said if the proposed bill is enacted then the impeachment process for governors will no longer be the preserve of the county assemblies and the Senate. Concerns have been raised by administrators and Kenyans that MCAs have been holding county bosses at ransom for selfish gain. Munya accompanied by governors Jack Ranguma (Kisumu) and Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia) made the comments when he brought the devolution torch to Kisumu county.
