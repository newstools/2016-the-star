The Busia government will start distributing milk to public Early Childhood Development Education centres for free, a senior county official has said. Bunyala subcounty administrator Francis Omillo said, “Milk helps develop the minds and reasoning capacity of children. This will enable them to be active in class and improve their academic performance.” He spoke during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Budalang’i Primary School last Thursday. Two hundred ECDE classrooms – at least six in each of the 35 wards – have been built in three years, Omillo said. He said bursaries have been distributed to secondary school students, adding that the process for the 2016-17 financial year has started. Omillo urged needy students to pick bursary forms. “A revolving fund for university and college students will be ready once proposed regulations are passed by the county assembly,” he said.
