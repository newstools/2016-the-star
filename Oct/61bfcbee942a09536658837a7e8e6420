After the 1-0 defeat that extinguished their shot at the SportPesa Super 8 League title, Jericho All Stars will be out to hit back at Kayole Asubuhi who condemned them to second place finish after imperious dominance when the two teams meet this afternoon. But the fact that Asubuhi managed to hold on their nerves to eventually win the league two points clear of Jericho, it spells all the ingredients of an explosive duel since the hosts are in dire need to progress to semis to keep alive their dreams of silverware consolation this term.Asubuhi under the tutelage of ex-Gor defender Isaiah Song Omondi, have a clean record against All Stars. In two meetings, Asubuhi has taken more points, four out of six, including the dramatic-yet crucial home win against the Thomas Okongo-led Jericho men in front of a stupendously packed City Stadium a few weeks ago.Despite the pre-match favourite tag, Omondi says it will be business as usual for the 2016 Super 8 League champs, who are on course for a double of titles this season. This is a knock-out competition and every game counts but for us. We are taking it seriously because every team wants to win. As a team, we have our own goals to achieve before the year ends and so far I think we are heading for that, a rather confident but composed Omondi said.Jericho All Stars team manager Erick Agwanda down-played suggestions that his side is under pressure from fans to deliver, saying the squad is in great shape to beat Asubuhi. Other matches will see Kawangware United take on TUK while Metro sports clash with Shauri Moyo. Ajax and Melta Kabiria will set the ball rolling with the 9am opener at City Stadium tomorrow.
