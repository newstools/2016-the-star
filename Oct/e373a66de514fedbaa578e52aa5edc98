Kwale leaders are engaged in a war of words over the purported extension of Base Titanium Company's licence.Governor Salim Mvurya has cautioned area Senator Juma Boy against spreading propaganda about an inexistent extension.The company, according to Mining CS Dan Kazungu, was only granted an exploration licence to prospect minerals at Mrima Hills.The ministry says it had okayed similar prospecting licences in Vihiga, Kakamega and Siaya for companies prospecting for gold.Read: CS Kazungu dismisses claim he licensed Base Titanium for Kwale activities Mvurya has dared Boy to continue with the 'lies' or he exposes blunders committed by the legislator 15 years ago as Matuga MP.Boy is said to be holding meetings with locals where he has allegedly informed that they will be relocated to pave way for the project.In defence of the prospects, the governor assured the residents of Lunga Lunga that they will not be moved from their current dwellings."If the senator doesn t back off, let him get ready to be exposed. We know a lot of secrets about him," the governor said."No one who is going to be relocated in order to pave way for exploration of minerals," he told the residents during the county's Mashujaa Day fete.The governor said that a lot of issues his office is handling are mistakes allegedly committed by the legislator in the past."Currently, we have a case in London over minerals deposits at Mrima Hills," Mvurya said.Read: Base Titanium gets nod to expand Kwale mine Boyi, for his part, said he is ready to face off the governor at any given time over the matter. He blamed Mvurya for taking sides with the national government on the issues of minerals in Kwale county."Whether extraction of minerals is authorised by governor or not, I will still oppose issues to do with extraction of minerals in the county," Boy said.He said the areas earmarked for exploration are densely populated and would expose the residents to dangers."I am not the only person with a dark past. The governor should know that I have issues I can make public if he provokes me," the senator said. "Mvurya is still green in politics. Can he disclose the amount of money he was given to ditch ODM for Jubilee?" Boy asked, adding that the governor is too junior to challenge him.
