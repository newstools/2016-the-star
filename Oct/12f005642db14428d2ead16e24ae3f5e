Troubled firms trading on the Nairobi Securities Exchange could from next year be placed under a recovery board to separate a bad company from good company first before delisting is considered. The Capital Markets Authority yesterday said it will present the framework to the national Treasury by end of November for adoption. Companies can go through challenging times and during challenging times they might cease to meet the minimum requirements for listing, but that should not automatically trigger a delisting. There is a need to go for a transition, CMA chief executive Paul Muthaura said during round table talks.
