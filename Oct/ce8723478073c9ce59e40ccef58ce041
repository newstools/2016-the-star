Vihiga Senator George Khaniri yesterday said it doesn&rsquo;t matter who is Cord&rsquo;s presidential flagbearer as long as the opposition remains united.He said Jubilee can only be sent home through a strategy similar to the one used by Narc in 2002 to remove Kanu from power after 24 years.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is ODM leader Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) or Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya). This is what I have been advocating for the last three years,&rdquo; Khaniri told the Star on the phone. He said Mudavadi is a key factor in the Kenyan politics and cannot be wished away.Khaniri asked Luhya Elders&rsquo; Forum chairman Patrick Wangamati to mind his language to ensure unity in the opposition. Wangamati on Monday said Mudavadi is a &ldquo;Jubilee mole&rdquo; out to cause divisions in Cord.Khaniri said it is difficult to defeat a sitting government, especially in Africa. He said the only way for the opposition to succeed is by uniting with the goal of bringing about change that isacceptable to all.He said the current jostling for the opposition ticket should not worry Kenyans, calling competition healthy. Raila, Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula have indicated they planning to form an alliance to defeat Jubilee next year. Mudavadi, the brains behind the National Super Alliance, says it will bring on board other like-minded parties, the business community and the labour movement.Khaniri said those supporting the Jubilee Party in Western will lose their seats because people are tired of corruption and tribalism and insecurity.
