ODM members in Bungoma have launched a scathing attack against Ford Kenya, accusing it of sabotaging Cord by insisting it is the dominant party in Western.Fourteen MCAs, former Internal Security assistant minister Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati and Kakamega county chief of staff Nabii Nabwire said Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula owes his freedom to ODM. They spoke during a meeting to endorse Maraka MCA Balala Mutoka for the branch chairman position.Governor hopeful Khang&rsquo;ati said were it not for ODM backing Wetang&rsquo;ula, he would have lost the 2014 by-election after being accused of bribing clergymen. He said Wetang&rsquo;ula should thank ODM for &ldquo;helping to get him off the hook&rdquo;.Khang&rsquo;ati said ODM is the &ldquo;darling&rdquo; of Western residents, especially the youth. He dismissed calls by Ford Kenya officials not to field its own candidates next year.&ldquo;Anyone who says ODM is weak in Bungoma and Western region at large is a fool. It is clear we have the highest number of MCAs at the assembly. We want to warn our brothers from Ford Kenya not to dare try and tell us Bungoma is a Ford Kenya zone when we know very well they have ridden on our back on many occasions,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said. Nabwire said, &ldquo;ODM is the strongest party in Western and can never be compared to Ford Kenya, which has brought a lot of confusion to Cord.&rdquo; &ldquo;These Ford Kenya brothers of ours have began to defecate on the plate they eat from.&rdquo; Khalaba MCA Majimbo Okumu said ODM has a national outlook &ldquo;unlike Ford Kenya, which has concentrated on opening offices in villages across Bungoma&rdquo;.&ldquo;While our party leader Raila Odinga is busy transversing the country in major rallies, they are busy asking him to endorse them,&rdquo; he said. Okumu said Ford-K is a &ldquo;village party&rdquo;.
