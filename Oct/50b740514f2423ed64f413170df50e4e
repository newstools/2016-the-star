ODM members in Bungoma have launched a scathing attack against Ford Kenya, accusing it of sabotaging Cord by insisting it is the dominant party in Western.Fourteen MCAs, former Internal Security assistant minister Alfred Khang ati and Kakamega county chief of staff Nabii Nabwire said Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang ula owes his freedom to ODM. They spoke during a meeting to endorse Maraka MCA Balala Mutoka for the branch chairman position.Governor hopeful Khang ati said were it not for ODM backing Wetang ula, he would have lost the 2014 by-election after being accused of bribing clergymen. He said Wetang ula should thank ODM for helping to get him off the hook .Khang ati said ODM is the darling of Western residents, especially the youth. He dismissed calls by Ford Kenya officials not to field its own candidates next year. Anyone who says ODM is weak in Bungoma and Western region at large is a fool. It is clear we have the highest number of MCAs at the assembly. We want to warn our brothers from Ford Kenya not to dare try and tell us Bungoma is a Ford Kenya zone when we know very well they have ridden on our back on many occasions, Khang ati said. Nabwire said, ODM is the strongest party in Western and can never be compared to Ford Kenya, which has brought a lot of confusion to Cord. These Ford Kenya brothers of ours have began to defecate on the plate they eat from. Khalaba MCA Majimbo Okumu said ODM has a national outlook unlike Ford Kenya, which has concentrated on opening offices in villages across Bungoma . While our party leader Raila Odinga is busy transversing the country in major rallies, they are busy asking him to endorse them, he said. Okumu said Ford-K is a village party .
