I will decide which one to go for,&quot; he said.Kenneth said that he made the decision considering that there will be no much change since the race for the country&#39;s top leadership has been confined between Cord and Jubilee.He made the comments at St Theresa girls grounds in Eastleigh.The sentiments come amid speculations that the former Gatanga legislator is being tipped to run for Nairobi governor. It is not clear which party he will be using.The latest development is likely to reshape Nairobi county politics which has seen many politicians come out to challenge Governor Evans Kidero.And Kenneth&#39;s move is expected to stir more competition in Jubilee, bearing in mind that Nairobi senator Mike Sonko has also declared interest to unseat Kidero.Kidero on his part has welcomed his competitors and assured them that they will get a run for the money as he is confident of serving a second term as the city boss.Read: Tough race for Nairobi governor as Kidero, Sonko flex musclesMPs Johnson Sakaja (Nominated), Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti) are among those eyeing the seat on a Jubilee ticket.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru and Miguna Miguna have also thrown their hats into the ring.Sonko, on his part, welcomed Kenneth to the duel saying he was ready to work with him.In a statement on Sunday, he said: &quot;I am ready to work with the former Gatanga MP if he joins Jubilee Party and participate in the free and fair Jubilee party nominations,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
