Ford Kenya Kakamega secretary Joseph Barasa yesterday accused DP William Ruto of scheming to destabilise the party. He said the attempt by Kitale human rights activist Ken Wafula to remove Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula as party leader is financed by Ruto. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing the same tricks and people used on the ICC being applied on Wetang&rsquo;ula.&rdquo;
