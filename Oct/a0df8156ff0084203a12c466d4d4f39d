Khelef said the people who raided his house only took three phones yet he has many valuable things. He blamed regional coordinator Nelson Marwa and other security organs for the housebreaking. &ldquo;Someone is sending the message that they can get me and I blame Marwa and the security organs for creating fear against activists,&rdquo;h e said. Khelef has previously accused police of wrongdoings including the killing of three women in what was said to be an attempted terror attack at Central police station in the county.
