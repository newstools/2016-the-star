The theft of billions of shillings from the Ministry of Health reported by its own internal auditors is unacceptable. Mothers and newborn babies top the list of those who stand to suffer, among them people living with Aids.This is deplorable, particularly as the ministry appears to have lost more than 20 per cent of the Sh23 billion allocated to healthcare in the national Budget.For every shilling stolen from the ministry of Health by thieving officials and the corruption cartels that play their puppet masters, an ailing Kenyan suffers even more and, or dies. Corruption kills, and never more so than when the stolen funds are taken from health budgets.Investigators must be thorough in following the digitised money trail and making meaningful arrests backed by solid and swiftly prosecutable evidence. The usual circus of merely going through the motions of investigation must not happen again.And government is surely aware HealthGate can only destroy what s left of its anti-corruption credentials as Kenyans head towards an election year.
