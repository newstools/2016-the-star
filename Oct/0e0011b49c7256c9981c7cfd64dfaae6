The Nairobi government's electronic payment system run by Jambopay has stringent controls and audit features, the Public Accounts Committee said yesterday.In a report, the team said the system provides a transparent revenue collection model with robust reporting capabilities."The county knows what is being collected, when it is collected and for what," says the report.Webtribe CEO Danson Muchemi told the committee, "A summary of collections by income line and channel is always made available to the county."According to the report, residents were provided with as many payment channels and options as there was, including M-Pesa, Yucash, Orange Money, Tangaza, Jambopay wallet, visa, master card, bank debit and credit cards and cash.The report says audit firm PKF was brought on board to act as a trustee in all the electronic transactions between the county and WebTribe.The committee tabled the Auditor General's report on the executive's financial operations between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014.The report says the committee summoned Webtribe's top management and questioned them how they won the revenue collection tender.Webtribe, which owns Jambopay, said the brand had the Central Bank of Kenya's approval to offer e-payment services,besides complying with international payment standards.Webtribe said no money has been lost and the deal is a win -win for the county, residents and the company.Several MCAs wrote to the EACC asking it to investigate how Jambopay was awarded the contract.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission warned MCAs to stop defaming JamboPay with allegations it was unfairly awarded the contract.Webtribe also wrote to the EACC, saying it is clean and welcomed investigations.After investigations, EACC said JamboPay should sue for defamation because the issues raised do not hold water. In March, MCAs wanted the tender cancelled on allegations it was unfairly awarded. City Hall defended the award and said that due process was followed.The EACC wrote to Webtribe saying that upon analyzing the reports , they are of the view that the issues raised border on defamation which can be addressed through the courts."The commission handles any information brought to its attention with utmost integrity, objectivity , confidentiality and one is considered innocent unless otherwise proven," read a letter from EACC addressed to Webtribe.The letter was written by EACC Director of Investigation Abdi A. Mohamud.However, they are not MCAs alone who have written to the EACC.Last year, Makadara MP Benson Mutura also wanted the e-payment contract cancelled.But City Hall lashed back at him and claimed he was demanding shs 11 million for payments of goods not supplied.
