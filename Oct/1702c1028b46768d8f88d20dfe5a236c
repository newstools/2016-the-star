Machakos residents did not disappoint yesterday when they hosted the first Mashujaa Day celebrations to be held outside Nairobi.Men, women, the old and the young came to celebrate, entertain and even pass a message of what the day really meant to them. Not even the strict security arrangements, the strict deadline set for entry into the stadium, the early morning cold or the scorching sun that followed could deter them from expressing their joy.The gates were opened at 5.30am. By 8am, all the stadium s 17 stands were full to capacity. They painted the stands with their red, white, green and black attire, carefully arranged to depict the Kenyan flag. The four-hour wait for President Uhuru Kenyatta was like a fraction of a minute to all, as they were kept happy by polished groups of entertainers.Police marched and Air Force jets showcased their aerial prowess in the Machakos airspace, giving residents an experience many have never had. Many were heard whispering, We only see this on TV. Now we have seen it live. Local entertainment groups did not disappoint. One performance by a group of primary schoolchildren drawn from different schools stood out as among the best.
