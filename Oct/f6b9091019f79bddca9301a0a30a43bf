Cotu boss Francis Atwoli has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve the Judiciary, Executive and Parliament to tame corruption.The secretary general said cartels were holding the country at ransom while swindling public funds, knowing prosecution will be compromised as they enjoy impunity.Atwoli warned that technocrats behind corrupt activities in Kenya understand how the three arms of government operate, therefore can avoid prosecution and continue intimidating others."People are stealing and roaming the streets knowing no one will put them in jail since the whole system is rotten," he said."When you wake in the morning people are still stealing despite warnings from the Executive. You read the newspaper daily and realise only God will save us."Atwoli added that corruption has rocked the Jubilee administration, compromising service delivery and Kenya's growth, leaving the public in despair. Corruption is so deeply rooted in this government that almost everyone is looking for an opportunity to steal," he told the Star by phone on Thursday."People are selfish and are not serving Kenyans' interests. They are running away with public funds despite our hospitals being in pathetic condition. Kenyans are being overtaxed yet the government is still borrowing billions of shillings. It is a sad state."[VIDEO] Frustrated Uhuru scolds state officials on rampant corruptionRead: I have played my part in corruption fight UhuruThe secretary general asked the public to put its foot down and push the Executive to act.He said Kenyans must stop "clapping at harambees" for people who steal their money and bribe them by raising funds.Corruption has been institutionalised, he noted, adding if untamed, if will "kill the society and erode all gains made since independence .
