Paul Ndung u, the man who chaired the commission that was probing illegally acquired land, wants his name removed from a legal battle over the ownership of a land claimed by three parties, among them a university.In the application filed yesterday, Ndung'u denied representing US-based businessman George Kiongera, owner of Maestro Health Connections Ltd, in the sale of the disputed parcel in Muthaiga. Maestro has never been our client so as to create an advocate/client relationship. We have never rendered any legal, professional or any other service to Maestro or engaged in any dealings contractual or tortuous or otherwise howsoever with the plaintiff to justify any form of legal claim against them, he said.The disputed land is being claimed by USIU-A, Dr Kiongera and Equity James CEO James Mwangi.The law firm of Ndung'u Njoroge and Kwach Advocates and Ndung u say the application filed by Kiongera is meant to scandalise and divert the court from determining "who is the rightful owner of the suit property".Ndung u and the firm say their continued presence in the proceedings is unnecessary in the determination of the three suits.Through lawyer Paul Muite, Ndung u has urged the court to have his name and that of the law firm struck out.They say that seeking to join them in the case is a "red herring" and the court should be aware of such tactics meant to take it off the substance of the real issues at hand. I and my firm shall suffer great prejudice and undue anxiety to be dragged in these proceedings that concern a dispute over the ownership of the suit property. We shall be turned into unwilling spectators of the inevitable legal engagement between Kiongera, USIU and Muthaiga Luxury Homes Ltd to determine the rightful owner of the property, they say.Muite told the court it would be unfair and unjust to make them sit through potentially protracted hearings of the suits.Ndung u said he only heard about Maestro company in July this year, when it was involved in a dispute with USIU. Maestro wants the court to declare the purported amalgamation irregular.He also seeks an order directing Ndung u and Chief Lands Registrar to cancel any documents that purports to amalgamate the title.Justice Samson Okong o directed the AG, the Chief Land Registrar and Maestro to file their defenses within 14 days. The matter will be mentioned on December 13.
