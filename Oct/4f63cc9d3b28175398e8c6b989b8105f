Prominent Eldoret politician-cum-farmer Jackson Kibor is seeking to end his 51-year marriage to his second wife Josephine. Kibor filed for divorce at an Eldoret court and accused his wife of desertion, cruelty and interfering with his ownership of an 800-acre piece of land in Kipkabus, Uasin Gishu county. He told senior principal magistrate Charles Obulutsa on Friday that he has not spent time with Josephine for more than 30 years. He asked the court to cancel their marriage certificate, which was issued in 1965. Once a supporter of opposition leader Raila Odinga, Kibor has been warming up to Deputy President William Ruto. Kibor has been embroiled in a land dispute with his immediate family and moved to court in May 2016 to bar the transfer of the land to his sons despite having subdivided it to them. The politician has accused his sons of fraudulently subdividing and processing title deeds for the plot measuring 1,547 acres in Uasin Gishu. Kibor was once captured in a video cutting a chain county officials had used to clamp his Lexus for not paying Sh100 parking fee.
