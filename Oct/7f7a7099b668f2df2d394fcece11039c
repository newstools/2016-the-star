An activist has moved to court seeking orders compelling the DPP and the DCI to investigate and prosecute Boniface Mwangi for hate speech and breach of peace.Victor Yegon also wants activist Mwangi stopped from publishing inciting comments on his social media pages.Yegon accused Mwangi of using social media to fan ethnic violence and incite the public, contrary to the National Cohesion and Integration Act.He cited protests over the death of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, saying Mwangi maliciously poured a red substance on police Spokesman Charles Owino.The act is punishable by law and amounted to breach of peace, he said in the suit file by his lawyer Ham Kiplagat on Monday."Mwangi's conduct should not go unpunished," he said, adding lack of court intervention places peace in the Rift Valley and other parts of the country at stake."The said conduct by Boniface Mwangi is prima facie evidence that the offense of hate speech and public peace has arisen and should not be left without legal consequence," the lawyer said.He termed Mwangi's conduct "unfortunate and loose", and with the potential of resulting in ethnic animosity.Kiplagat said he was apprehensive that unless the court issues the orders there will be a degeneration of the constitution and the disintegration of the long fought for peace in the country.The matter was certified as urgent and set for hearing in the afternoon.
