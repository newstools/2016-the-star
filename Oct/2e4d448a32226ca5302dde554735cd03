This week had a number of promising signs if renewed dedication by the government in the fighting corruption.It began with the president admitting that there has not been enough progress made in ending the prevalence of graft within Kenya. This was at the Governance and Accountability summit at State House. Then came the opposition leader Raila Odinga's relentless criticism of the president on the same issue, and the pressure this has put on the president to do even more to end official corruption.Finally, there has been the swearing in of the new Chief Justice, David Maraga a new broom coming in to sweep corruption out of the judiciary, following a gruelling and televised selection and vetting process.The weeks ahead will reveal if indeed this was a turning point in the fight against corruption, with the president escalating pressure on the various top officers charged with fighting corruption; the opposition leaders continuing in their role as public watchdog; and the judiciary also renewing its efforts to speed up the trial of the corruption-related cases that come before it.
