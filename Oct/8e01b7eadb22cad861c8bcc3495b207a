Mutuku was to represent women.Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chairman Jaffer Kassam said the Kenya National Examinations Council confirmed the papers are fake.&ldquo;Mr Olali did not register nor sit the 1980 KCE examination at Bar-Kowino Secondary School under index number 61002038, as indicated in his papers,&rdquo; he said.Knec confirmed the examination centre, Bar-Kowino Secondary School code 61002, does not exist in its database for the 1980 KCE examination, Kassam said.The chairman said the exams council also said Mutuku forged her academic papers.&ldquo;Mutuku did not register nor sit the 1990 KCE examination at Kambu Secondary School under index number 301770017,&rdquo; Kassam said.Kidero had nominated six people to the authority. Gore Mohamed (representing CBOs), Ismael Khalif (youth), Mercy Osando (people with disability) and Peter Mutua (business) were approved.The six were recommended to the governor for nomination by the County Public Service Board after interviews.County assembly majority leader Elias Otieno and his minority counterpart Abdi Guyo were also appointed to the authority, which will be chaired by the governor.Other members are representatives from the National Police Service, the NIS and the DCI.The committee recommended the two charged with forgery. They accused the board of failing to scrutinise the candidates, including their academic and professional papers, before forwarding their names to the assembly.&ldquo;The County Public Service Board must take full responsibility for not conducting minimum due diligence required before clearing nominees for consideration and appointment and that they be sanctioned in case of any future recurrence,&rdquo; Kassam said.The authority, established by the National Police Service Act 2011, promotes community policing initiatives and develops proposals on priorities, objectives and targets for police performance.
