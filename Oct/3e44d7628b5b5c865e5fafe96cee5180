But most Kenyans said they only meant that the activist's life was in danger. "Nobody claims his death...We simply won't take another fall after the late Jacob's death," wrote&nbsp; Ahmed Junior. Junior further asked Imanyara to stop using Mwangi as a scapegoat. "He has a life worth more than a mile," he said. A user identified as Senior Citizen Solo said: " Nobody said he is dead. We know he is so much alive." Another user named George said no one cares as it "l ooks like Mwangi is fighting DP on behalf of ODM [sic]." The co ntroversial activist denied defaming Ruto; he said in a&nbsp; 36-page defence&nbsp;and counter claim affidavit filed at the High Court that the DP is a public officer, therefore subject to scrutiny. He maintains that Ruto has been adversely mentioned in the matters that are subject to the suit against him.The DP sued the activist for linking him to Juma's death through a&nbsp;tweet&nbsp;published on September 30.Juma who was&nbsp;shot dead on May 6&nbsp;by unknown people while driving past Lenana School on his way home.More on this: Activist Boniface Mwangi denies defaming DP RutoAlso read:&nbsp; See you in court, Boniface Mwangi tells Ruto on defamation suit
