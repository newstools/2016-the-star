Sumbi said the majority of the funds will be used for capacity building. He said 90 health facilities have been forced to close for lack of water. Sumbi said Sh450 million is needed to connect the facilities to piped water. He said the water department was allocated Sh100 million this financial year. Sumbi said most of the money was used to settle bills.He accused the national Treasury of frustrating ithe county by refusing to give guarantees to investors . So many investors have come to us and when we take them to Treasury for guarantees, everything is slowed down, Sumbi said.
