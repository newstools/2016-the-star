Police fired teargas to disperse medical lab students who attempted to break into the ministry of health headquarters in Nairobi during a demonstration.The students, from various universities, marched from&nbsp;Kenyatta National Hospital to the offices to press for internship posting upon completion of their studies.They were dispersed as they sought audience with the Health cabinet secretary Cleopa Mailu.The students wanted the CS to organise for their examination and subsequent licensing as soon as they finish their studies.The students were drawn from University of Nairobi, Technical University of Kenya, Kenya Methodist University, Kenyatta University and Mount Kenya University.Others were from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kisii University, Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology and Maseno University.They asked Mailu to make arrangement to have graduates of the Medical laboratory profession posted for paid internship at job group "K" by the ministry from 2017.A medical laboratory student runs into teargas when they were dispersed during a demonstration in calls for paid internship at Afya House, October 24. /MONICAH MWANGI&nbsp;Addressing the press, the students said that they want the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board to collaborate with universities to administer the examinations in good time to avert delays."While the government has sufficiently catered for doctors, nurses' and pharmacists' internship programmes',&nbsp; medical laboratory scientists have all along been neglected," Collins Ogaa of Kenyatta University said."This is despite the critical role we play in diagnostic medicine," he added, "We want issuance of licenses by KMLTTB streamlined,"Ogaa said their push will make the profession excel in providing quality and reliable laboratory services to Kenyans and beyond."There has been a crisis since November last year when the KMLTTB examinations were done.The same has not been administered since then," he said.The students said that graduates of November 2015 paid to book the KMLTTB examinations in May but have not been licensed hence they cannot secure jobs."We request that licensing examinations be administered in collaboration with universities immediately students complete their degrees," Ogaa said.The students also want the regulatory agency to establish a calendar detailing dates for administration of the competency tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
