The opposition is seeking external financial support to influence the 2017 election, Deputy President William Ruto has said.Kenyans should be allowed to elect their own leaders without influence from outsiders, he said.He spoke at Bukhalalire High School in Butula, Busia county, on Saturday. It is unfortunate that some of our worthy competitors are asking for foreigners help to fund their campaigns, Ruto said.The Jubilee administration is not shaken by such moves as Kenyans voted for it in the March 4, 2013, election despite pressure from outsiders, he said. Kenyans have before and will again reject external attempts to influence them during elections. Kenyans are well-placed to elect leaders who are development-conscious, Ruto said.The DP told the Luhya to vote for the Jubilee Party, adding that he is optimistic it will form the government next year.Ruto asked the community not to waste votes by choosing those who are destined to lose . Those in the opposition have no agenda for you. When we plan development they are busy planning demonstrations, he said.Ruto said Jubilee is committed to eliminating politics based on ethnicity, citing the recent move to bring all its affiliate parties together under one party. Politics based on this tribe versus that tribe has no room in this century. This is why we are asking all Kenyans to join us in uniting all communities... We should therefore build bridges among all of us, the DP said. You should not be misled to support individuals who are yet to decide on who their flagbearer will be. He said the government remains committed to providing water and electricity, and improving roads, schools and hospitals.
