After a ten-year stint at Dohty Family, popular Kenyan reggae spinmaster DJ Moh has finally quit the entertainment unit. This comes just days after the label's founder Kriss Darlin' was blasted on social media by another Kenyan deejay for allegedly being too "greedy".

He wrote partly on his social media pages some moments ago: "It's been a journey full of ups and downs but I'm thankful for everything I've learnt and everyone I've met along the way. "I hereby wish to inform all my fans and followers at large that I will no longer be under the above management (Dohty Family). "This was definitely a hard decision and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity I was given. I wish to focus on building my own Brand." Moh added, "To my lovely fans who have been with me through the best and the worst times, those who have even turned into life time friends, the ones who always turn up for my events regardless of the distance, I am forever grateful for without you there's no me. "I wish to state that I am and will continue to entertain as a reggae DJ but on my own management. "I am no longer with the Dohty Family." It's left to be seen whether Moh will team up with his younger brother DJ Kym at NickDee Entertainment. Kym is also a mixmaster at Kiss TV and Kiss FM.
