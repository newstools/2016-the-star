Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat has declared he will run for Kericho governor.The second-term MP is joined by former Roads minister Franklin Bett, former National Social Security Fund managing trustee Richard Langat and Kenya Ports Authority director Fred Kirui.It will be hard for the four to unseat Governor Paul Chepkwony. He has won broad support for his struggle to have tea farmers compensated by the British government for historical injustices. Speaking to journalists in Kericho on Friday, Langat said he is equal to the task.Supporters of Chepkwony and Ainamoi MP clashed at Kericho Green Stadium at the Mashujaa Day celebration. Langat s supporters said the governor has failed them and has not fulfilled the promises he made in 2013.Chepkwony says he will defend the seat on the Jubilee Party ticket. He promises to be the chief campaigner for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. He said will launch Operation Ruto to enable the DP to win the presidency in 2022.Analysts say Langat s only chance to remain in politics is to defend his Ainamoi seat and let Bett, Langat and Kirui face off with Chepkwony.
