BHANDINI RESTAURANT, INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, NAIROBI Indian food evokes fiery flavours, chillies and burning taste buds. Well, Bhandini Restaurant at The Intercontinental Hotel, Nairobi, is anything but. Granted, for those who can handle the heat, all meals can be made hot , but the norm is delicately flavoured foods, with just enough zing to make the experience truly authentic.The meal starts off with golden brown papadums, flaky pieces of flat bread made of lentils and mixed Indian spices. Of course, drinks are to be had, and we opted for the Mango Lassi , a mixture of fresh mango juice and yoghurt, spiced with saffron. This decadently thick beverage is highly recommended because, as well as being refreshing, it settles the stomach and mouth during a spicy meal, allowing you to fully enjoy the tastes.On to the starter! To be honest, I thought the starter was the main meal An array of dishes was placed in front of us, displaying an explosion of colours and smells. The most memorable was the Chilli Fish, which, despite its name, had a more sweet &amp; sour flavour and was completely boneless (not an easy feat). The main course consisted of Kerala Chicken Curry, with a vibrant fusion of yellows and greens and also decadently soft. The Mutton Roganjosh from Northern India is slightly musky in flavour and was quite heady, but it was placated by the aromatic Neichoru Rice .Dessert was a fluffy sponge-like milk dumpling flavoured with saffron, palm oil and pistachio nuts.All in all, the cuisine will satisfy even the most discerning of diners.
