A group of conservationists from Coast region Saturday joined other environmentalists to protest against the Standard Gauge Railway project cutting across Nairobi national park.The unique beach protest organised by Friends of Arabuko Sokoke was held along the Indian Ocean beach at the Driftwood club.This was to show solidarity with other organisations which are against the construction of the railway in the city s largest national park.They used a dhow with Kenyan flag and banner with the messages towards conservation of the natural resource."Friends of Arabuko Sokoke forest in solidarity with Nairobi national park. Supporting our forest, parks and beaches," one of the banners read.Read: SGR eats into Nairobi National Park in final plan for Nairobi-Naivasha route The demonstrators, mostly from foreign countries but of Kenyan origin, took turns to sail in the dhow along the white beaches.They said the action was for the world to see and also reject the construction of the SGR within the park.Others, both young and old, held placards on the shores of the ocean marked "We stand in solidarity with Nairobi national park".Some banners also carried the message: "I Stand with NNP, Save the Wild in My life,"Tom Pritchet, former chairman of Friends of Nairobi national park, said allowing SGR to go through the park will have negative impacts on its environment.Pritchet told journalists that there is no city across the world with a national park, therefore the need to preserve the Nairobi national park."Once it is destroyed, it cannot be brought back. We fear that the noise from the activities along the railway shall destroy the ambience," he said.He said if the ambience of the park is lost, then it will equally lose its touristic appeal as an attraction site.Pritchet said without the natural ecosystem no one will have interest and shall opt to other destinations.He commended the Kenya Wildlife Service for their job in conservation and protection of the wildlife.Lissa Reuben, a conservationist from the Friends of Arabuko Sokoke, said they cannot allow the SGR to go near, over nor through the park.She said both Kenyans and foreigners were opposed to the SGR project within the park as it would do more harm than good."We want this message to go all over the world," she said.Read: Conservationists up in arms as proposed SGR route eats into Nairobi National Park
