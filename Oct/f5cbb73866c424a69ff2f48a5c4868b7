Stern action will be taken against public officers who will violate the policy that stipulates they should fly Kenya Airways while on official foreign trips, the Ministry of Transport has warned.&ldquo;Severe action will be taken for breaches,&rdquo; Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said on the phone yesterday. &ldquo;I will be reporting to the Cabinet on compliance. It (Fly Kenya Policy) should be in place by end of November.&rdquo;The Cabinet approved the policy on October 13 during the Seventh Ordinary Meeting chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta, in a renewed effort to save the loss-making national carrier from a further slide.The ministry said it plans to propose amendment to the Public Procurement and Disposal Act to ensure full compliance.&ldquo;Fly Kenya Policy is going to go through Parliament as it's technically an amendment to the procurement regulations. And will this override that as an amendment?&rdquo; Transport PS Irungu Nyakera said. &ldquo;This is not coming in as a directive but a change in law.&rdquo;If successful, increased trips by state officials and delegations could be a shot in the arm for the cash-strapped airline, as it will rake in millions.
