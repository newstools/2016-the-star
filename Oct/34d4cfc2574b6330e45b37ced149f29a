The Mombasa government will not bring American Nicki Minaj for a music concert after Muslim clerics warned against her &lsquo;almost naked&rsquo; performance. Director of communications Richard Chacha yesterday said there is no truth in the speculation the county plans to bring her to Kenya in December. This comes after the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya on Thursday warned against bringing &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; international artistes to promote tourism.There has been speculation the county will bring Minaj, following the successful Mombasa Rocks concert starring , American artiste Chris Brown.Chacha told the Star on the phone, &ldquo;Those are rumours with no basis. The county has no such plans.&rdquo;CIPK organising secretary Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa said Minaj &ldquo;is a symbol of immorality and her music videos are full of her images in which she is almost naked&rdquo;. He threatened to organise a mass protest against Minaj&rsquo;s rumoured trip. &ldquo;She performs with only her inner-wear. What will happen with the fans?&rdquo; They will be completely naked!&rdquo; he said.
