KRA yesterday intercepted 22-foot containers loaded with contraband lead batteries destined for South Korea at the Port of Mombasa.The Kenya Revenue Authority said the two containers, whose content had been disguised as 800 bags of Kenyan tea, were found to be carrying used automobile lead batteries.KRA said the government has not issued any licence to scrap metal dealers to export used automobile batteries, lead scrap or refined lead.The export was in contravention of the Scrap Metal Act of 2015 and the Third Schedule of the East African Customs Management Act.A clearing agent, Kapwell Enterprises Ltd of Nairobi and an exporter, Kakuzi Ltd Nairobi, were listed on the Customs Entry Declaration of the two consignments.KRA deputy commissioner for Southern region Nicholas Kinoti yesterday said the exporter and the clearing agent will be taken to court before the end of the week. KRA also said the clearing agent risks being suspended for facilitating the export of prohibited goods. &ldquo;We have made progress in our investigations and we will make some arrests,&rdquo; Kinoti said.He said the interception was informed by intelligence reports received by the Customs Enforcement Unit based at the port on October 13.The principal objective of restricting this particular commodity was to create a feed stock of crude batteries that can be recycled for purposes of extracting lead for the local manufactures of automotive batteries.
