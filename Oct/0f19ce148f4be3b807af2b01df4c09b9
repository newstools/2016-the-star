The Athi Water Services Board will build a new multipurpose dam in Murang a county, even as the debate over the Northern Water Collector Tunnel rages.The board has advertised for a consultant to conduct a feasibility study for a public-private partnership on the design, construction, maintenance and financing of Maragua Dam. The board has also advertised for consultancy services for the development of an integrated water master plan for the county. It says the consultancy services will be carried out in 25 weeks. The consultants will identify a robust water source development strategy to ensure water security and meet growth demands for the next 25 years.The consultants will be required to prepare demand estimates for the county until 2042 and identify potential water sources and their development. The dam s construction will further aggravate the debate over water supply. In 2011, residents in Gatara village, Kiharu, opposed the construction of Maragua Dam on the border of Kiharu, Kangema and Kigumo constituencies.They said the dam would displace more than 3,000 people and they would lose revenue from their tea farms. A multipurpose dam serves both economic and financial functions. The Maragua Dam will be used for irrigation and power generation.Former MPs Peter Kenneth (Gatanga), Elias Mbau (Maragua) and Barnabas Muturi (Kiharu) opposed the construction of the dam.They said the dam would adversely affect the area s climate and residents may not be adequately compensated. The leaders cited Ndakaini Dam, which they said has impoversished the residents affected. Kenneth said even though the government promised to pay Ndakaini residents, they still live as squatters. The 235,000 cubic-metre dam was expected to improve Nairobi water.
