Anger, muscle flexing and heated verbal confrontations between Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia and Senator Kembi Gitura yesterday marred a Senate committee meeting.Wairia appeared before the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee at Parliament Buildings. He interrupted Gitura who was making his presentations and poking holes in the response given by the county government on audit queries.The governor appeared to answer audit questions in the Auditor General s 2013-14 audit report. Wairia accused Gitura, who is also the Senate deputy speaker, of using the committee to settle political scores.Gitura asked the governor to explain why the county bought 34 acres at Sh340 million while a private property valuer had priced it in 2015 at Sh194 million. I will not allow this committee to be used as a political arena to drive the agenda of the senator at the expense of truth and the people of Murang a, Wairia said.The governor kept on interrupting every senator who attempted to speak and threatened to walk out. Wairia said committee chairman Anyang Nyong o was unfair to him as he was not given adequate time to respond to allegations levelled against him. I will not allow Senator Gitura to malign my name here. I will not keep quiet anymore, Wairia said, amid uproar from senators.The county chief accused his senator of using a fake valuation report, yet the county government valuers had valued and quantified the land said to be along Kenol-Kabati road. Gitura kept calm, warning the governor that he cannot intimidate him by making noise as it is his responsibility as the senator to raise any issues affecting the county. Nyong o ordered the Serjeant at-Arms to throw out two officials who attempted to shout down Gitura.
