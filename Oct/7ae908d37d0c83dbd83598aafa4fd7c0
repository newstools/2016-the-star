Two suicide bombers
killed at least eight people on Saturday in the northeastern
Nigerian city of Maiduguri, the heart of a seven-year-old
insurgency by Islamist Boko Haram militants, the military said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the
attacks bore the hallmarks of Boko Haram which has been trying
to set up an Islamic state in the northeast, killing thousands
and displacing more than 2 million people. In one attack a woman who blew herself up at 0600 GMT in
front of the Bakasi camp for displaced persons on Maiduguri's
outskirts, killing five men and wounding 11 women, the army said
in a statement. At about the same time another female suicide bomber blew
herself up while trying to enter a fuel depot of state oil firm
NNPC, killing three persons, the army said. Residents saw bodies being carried into an ambulance by
government emergency services. Boko Haram controlled a swathe of land around the size of
Belgium at the start of 2015, but Nigeria's army, aided by
troops from neighboring countries, has recaptured most of the
territory. The group still stages suicide bombings in the northeast, as
well as in neighbouring Niger and Cameroon.
