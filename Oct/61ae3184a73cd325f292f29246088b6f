THE loss of Sh5.3 billion at Afya House reported by internal auditors to the Auditor General in a draft report leaked to the Nation Media Group should see heads roll at the ministry of Health headquarters.The money trail is digital and the names of the companies and their directors involved are no mystery. The devil, as is often said, is in the details. Kenyans must not lose sight of the forest for the trees in this affair.A phenomenal sum of money has been lost almost as surely as if it were taken in a heist at gunpoint. The ministry s auditors have done their job. Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Maillu and Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri need to shed full-disclosure light on what, exactly, happened, the who, where, when, why and how and with what result. Did any of the companies listed as having received the Sh5 billion-plus actually deliver anything to Afya House, or any health programme in any hospital, even counterfeits? Or was the cash just taken?
