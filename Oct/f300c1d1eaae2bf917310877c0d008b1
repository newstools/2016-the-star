Athi Water Services Board CEO Malaquen Milgo yesterday dismissed claims the Sh6.8 billion Northern Water Collection Tunnel project will hurt Murang&rsquo;a.He said similar projects have not had a negative impact on the environment or on water supply. Milgo said the tunnel is &ldquo;an incredible investment Kenyans should gather facts about&rdquo;. AWSB is implementing the project.&ldquo;The tunnel is a true bet on science and latest technology and a demonstration of how Kenya continues to tap into the latest technology,&rdquo; he said. ODM leader Raila Odinga has said the project &mdash; which was part of his Master Plan when he was Prime Minister &mdash; will cause regional desertificaiton in five years and starve Murang&rsquo;a and other areas of water that will be channelled to Narobi. He called it &ldquo;tunnels of death&rdquo;. The state defends the project and says environment impact will not be harmful. However, two Murang&rsquo;a MPs on Thursday appeared undecided over whether the government should proceed with the construction. Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata (Kiharu) and Tirus Ngahu (Kangema) said they support the project but the national government should carry out reforestation of the Aberdare Forest and commit to connecting all homes to clean piped water. Kang&rsquo;ata said, &ldquo;My main issue is that the people of Murang&rsquo;a should get water.&rdquo; Ngahu said, &ldquo;The bone of contention was that residents of the county were not going to get water.&rdquo;
