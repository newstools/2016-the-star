A forum attended by more than 5,000 youth in Kisii has sent Governor James Ongwae s opponents back to the drawing board, 10 months to the polls.The forum held last Saturday, and which was attended by Cord leader Raila Odinga, has forced a group of politicians coalescing around Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and Senator Chris Obure to re-strategise their Kisii unity initiative.The two leaders and at least nine MPs have been traversing the county to drum up support for Jubilee under the guise of Kisii community unity, whose philosophy is said to be targeting to isolate the governor.Other proponents of the unity include MPs Joel Onyancha (Bomachoge Borabu), Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache), Elijah Moindi (Nyaribari Masaba), Richard Tong i (Nyaribari Chache), Stephen Manoti (Bobasi) and Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache North).
