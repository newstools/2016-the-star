Belgium declared on Monday that
it could not formally back a free trade deal between the
European Union and Canada because of an internal Belgian
dispute, but the two sides still appeared to be holding out
hopes of a summit to sign off on the deal. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told European Council
president Donald Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to
consent to a deal that all 27 other EU members are ready to
support because its French-speaking authorities opposed it. The European Union had given Belgium until late on Monday to
overcome that opposition or the EU-Canada summit on Thursday to
sign the pact with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would
be cancelled. However, Tusk said he and Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau still believed the summit could go ahead. "Together with PM @JustinTrudeau, we think Thursday's summit
still possible," Tusk said in a tweet. "We encourage all parties
to find a solution. There's yet time," he tweeted. Michel, whose federal government backs the Comprehensive
Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), had called a meeting of the
heads of Belgium's regions and linguistic communities. "We cannot give a 'Yes'," Paul Magnette, the premier of the
French-speaking Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged.
He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has
already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU
authorities. Other Socialist-led authorities, including those of the
bilingual capital Brussels, have thrown their weight behind the
Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers have backed Michel's
centre-right coalition. The issue goes beyond just a trade deal with Canada, the
EU's 12th-largest trading partner. If CETA fails, the EU's hopes of completing similar deals
with the United States or Japan would be in tatters, undermining
a bloc already battered by Britain's vote to leave it and
disputes over Europe's migration crisis. "These are dark days for European trade policy," said Ulrich
Grillo, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI).
"This blockade is undermining the trust of international
partners in the EU." PRINCIPLES OR INTERNAL POLITICS? Geert Bourgeois, premier of the Dutch-speaking Flanders
region, called it a real shame. "We're the laughing stock of the whole world. It's bad for
Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole
world," he told reporters after the meeting of less than an
hour. EU negotiators say they are willing to keep talking with the
Walloons though Canada's trade minister left in frustration
after talks in the regional capital Namur on Friday, saying the
problems were internal ones for the Europeans to sort out. Andre Antoine, Walloon parliament speaker, told Reuters
earlier on Monday more time was needed: "A reasonable time frame
would be the end of the year. With that, we could get there." CETA supporters say it would increase trade between the
partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion
euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada's by C$12 billion (US $9
billion). Magnette's main objection is to an investor protection
system that would allow foreign companies to sue host states
they deem are harming their investments. Critics argue it
enables multinationals to dictate public policy. The European Commission says CETA has overhauled this, with
guarantees on the right of governments to regulate and judges
appointed by EU and Canada rather than parties to a dispute. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is
using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday
that Magnette's stance was both a matter of principle and
opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become
leader of the centre-left in Belgium. "The takeout is you can't give everyone a veto. It doesn't
work. Belgium needs to sort this out," said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama,
director of thinktank EPICE.
