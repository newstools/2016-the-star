President Uhuru&rsquo;s first born son Jomo Kenyatta and his longtime girlfriend held their traditional wedding ceremony on Saturday afternoon at an undisclosed location. President Uhuru&rsquo;s first in-law looked gorgeous in her green and blue dress while Jomo donned a traditional Kikuyu shirt. The two lovebirds who have been seen in various public events including Jamuhuri day celebrations, outgoing USA President Obama&rsquo;s visit and the historic visit from the Pope, got engaged in June this year. It is intimated their white wedding will be formalised early next year.
