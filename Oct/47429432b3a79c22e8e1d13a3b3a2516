Former New York and Boston marathon champion Rita Jeptoo s ambitions of a quick return to competition has been dealt a big blow after her dope ban was doubled to four years.The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld an appeal lodged by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to have the athlete given a lengthy ban for using banned substance Erythropoietin (Epo).Jeptoo has also been disqualified from the Boston marathon she won in 2014.Jeptoo was originally banned for two years by Athletics Kenya after testing positive for the banned blood-booster Epo in September 2014 but world athletics governing IAAF challenged the ban and appealed to CAS for it to be increased.Just a week ago, Jeptoo, whose initial ban was set to expire this week said she was looking forward to returning to marathon running where she had succeeded since her first win at the 2004 Stockholm Marathon.She went on to win Milan, Boston (three times) and Chicago (two times) marathons, before she was busted for systematic Epo use in 2014.She was set to be crowned the 2014 World Marathon Majors champion in 2014 before the scandal was exposed.In addition to the increased ban, Jeptoo s results in the 2014 Boston marathon and all other results from 17 April 2014 (including the 2014 Chicago marathon) have been cancelled.She was initially banned after an out of competition sample from 25 September 2014 returned a positive finding on 24 October 2014. The sentence commenced on 27 January 2015.However, on 13 March 2015, the athlete filed an appeal at the CAS against the decision of Athletic Kenya which she later withdrew. Compatriot Edna Kiplagat stands to be crowned the 2014 WMM winner following the cancellation of Jeptoo s 2014 winnings.CAS said the evidence included Jeptoo s long relationship with her doctor, that her Epo use was consistent with her competition calendar and that she hid visits to her doctor from her coach and manager.It added that her conduct was deceptive and obstructive throughout the proceedings.In Moscow, Russia has dismissed a deputy sports minister at the heart of the doping scandal that led to their track and field athletes being banned from the Rio Olympics, the government said on Monday.Yury Nagornykh was named as a key player in an investigation into state-sponsored doping by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published weeks before the 2016 games.The report said Nagornykh was routinely informed about positive doping tests and decided who would benefit from a cover-up and who would not .The Russian government website made no mention of the doping scandal, saying that Nagornykh had asked to resign and his dismissal had been signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Nagornykh s departure follows that of his former boss, sports minister Vitaly Mutko, who was given the post of deputy prime minister overseeing sports last week, and the head of Russia s Olympic Committee.
