This earnings release is already in the public domain and it is expected that Kenya Airways will report a loss but half of that reported in the previous H1. Kenya Airways formally announced today that the chairman Ambassador Awori will be stepping down and would be replaced by Michael Joseph. MJ has the gravitas and the track record to perform what is a complex turnaround. I estimate Kenya Airways needs up to $1 billion and serious leadership is required in order to persuade owners of capital to pony it up. Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways are surely in pole position.

Kenyan reported a +29 per cent year-on-year increase in headline revenue which is an outlier when set aside other utility type peers. Investors were disappointed with the dividend pass which snapped a 10 year dividend pay out track record. The managing director Albert Mugo explained: "Dividend policy of 30 per cent of profit after tax is unchanged but we are in a growth spurt hence the need to pass''There was an explanation around ''compensating tax'' and I suspect investors will be satisfied that they have forgone dividends for faster growth which will pay better dividends in the future.
