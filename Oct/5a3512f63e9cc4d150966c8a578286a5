He said asking Kenneth to contest in Nairobi next year is part of the plan to sabotage Ruto&rsquo;s ambitions.&ldquo;We even know where they meet at night to plan moves against Ruto and we will soon name those involved,&rdquo; Mandago said.Mwangi has been sued by Ruto for defamation, but the activist has demanded records of the DP&rsquo;s wealth from the Kenya Revenue Authority and the electoral agency for his defence.The governor, a close Ruto ally, said the 2017 election will be peaceful and Jubilee deserves a second term.Kenneth has declared he will not run for President next year but will vie for governor in Nairobi, Murang&rsquo;a or Nakuru. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve started seeing some plans by those asking him to vie in Nairobi and not Murang&rsquo;a. We know them by name and we will reveal them soon,&rdquo; Mandago said.More on this: Kenneth complicates Ruto plans
