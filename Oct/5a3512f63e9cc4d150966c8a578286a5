Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago says the Kikuyu community must vote for Deputy President William Ruto in 2022 to pay a political debt of the 2013 and 2017 elections .He also said on Tuesday powerful politicians from Central Kenya are grooming former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth for President in 2022. We are telling them that, dawa ya deni ni kulipa. In 2022, they have to vote for Ruto, because we have voted for them in 2013 and we will do the same in 2017, Mandago said.He spoke in Kapseret during the funeral of former aspirant for Kapseret Wesley Kirorei. He was with area MP Oscar Sudi, who said they will not allow themselves to be used and dumped in 2022.Mandago said they are aware of schemes to tarnish Ruto s name to bar him from running for President in 2022. For those who dream they will tarnish Ruto s name through someone called Boniface Mwangi so that by 2022 they can start giving excuses, we will not accept that, the governor said. He said asking Kenneth to contest in Nairobi next year is part of the plan to sabotage Ruto s ambitions. We even know where they meet at night to plan moves against Ruto and we will soon name those involved, Mandago said.Mwangi has been sued by Ruto for defamation, but the activist has demanded records of the DP s wealth from the Kenya Revenue Authority and the electoral agency for his defence.The governor, a close Ruto ally, said the 2017 election will be peaceful and Jubilee deserves a second term.Kenneth has declared he will not run for President next year but will vie for governor in Nairobi, Murang a or Nakuru. We ve started seeing some plans by those asking him to vie in Nairobi and not Murang a. We know them by name and we will reveal them soon, Mandago said.
