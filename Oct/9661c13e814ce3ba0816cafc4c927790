Cord leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday asked the IEBC to conduct a fresh voter registration of all eligible Kenyans before the August 8 polls.Raila said the new register should capture biometric data of voters namely fingerprints and iris recognition (of the eyes).The ODM leader said that new listing, which he has called less than 10 months to the next polls, will end cases of ghost and repeat voters."The biometric voter register will be afresh. The current register must be rendered obsolete. We don't want it to be used in next polls," Raila said.He said, during a meeting with delegates in Kuria, that this was among the demands they made when the former IEBC commissioners were sent home."In the last election, the polls were rigged and we need the new register in place before the 2017 elections," he said.Raila directed ODM officials to ensure all eligible voters are registered on time when the drive will be called.Read: IEBC selection panel to unveil chair, commissioners on November 30Also read: Pick credible candidates to lead IEBC, selection panel urgedHe at the same time urged the Kuria community in Migori county to vote for him in the forthcoming Cord presidential primaries.The meeting was held at the height of tension between the Kuria and Luos over the 'negotiated democracy' that shaped the 2013 polls.At that time, Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta shared the presidential votes in nearly equal halves.This was despite a deal between Luo and Kuria to share county seats equally in exchange for a bloc vote for Cord."Kuria votes which were cast for Jubilee were enough to stage a run off as Jubilee only defeated us with 7,000 presidential votes," Raila said.He asked the community to be keen on the calls for a bloc vote, further pressing for a six-piece ODM vote for seats in Kuria region."This time we don t want to have any "madoadoa' in Migori county. Let us strive for all seats to be under ODM party," the ODM leader said.In 2013, Raila spearheaded an agreement between the majority Luo community and the minority Kuria community to share county positions.This was in a bid to ensure the Kuria community vote for him as a bloc, but Kuria East and West voted for Mathias Robi (URP) and Shadrack Manga (Kanu) respectively.Senator Wilfred Machage, woman representative Dennitah Ghati and Deputy Govenor Mwita Mahanga represented the community at the county.Raila also told off senator Machage for defecting to Jubilee alliance despite being voted through an ODM ticket under the said negotiated democracy."We have many leaders from Kuria who can fill his position. We will not miss him in the next polls," he said.Raila s wife Ida said it was sad that Jubilee party got more votes than Cord in Machage s home turf, adding that the community has a 'debt' to pay in 2017."We need to be honest as Migori communities. If Kuria want to vote for us, then they need to be open. They should also be open up if they don t want to," Ida said.Ghati said the community will have to pay their debt for the bloc vote that they did not give Raila in 2013."We have more to gain by standing with a popular party in Nyanza and Migori than cast our nets elsewhere. What happen in 2013 should never be repeated in Kuria," she said.Simeon Maginga, an elder from Kuria West, said the party should ensure they conduct free and fair nomination in the community to ensure they get all seats.
