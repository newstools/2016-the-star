Mandera county has enough security personnel but they are too afraid to conduct night patrols, Governor Ali Roba has said. Roba said this on Tuesday following an al Shabaab attack at Bishaare Hotel in Mandera town that left 12 people dead. " I cannot ask for more security for Mandera.&nbsp;There are enough personnel but they cannot patrol because of fear.&nbsp;We have to look for them and ask why they cannot protect the people," he said. But in an address to the media, Roba asked the government to dispatch 300 police reservists to boost the county's security. "T he border security programme should also be fast-tracked," he said. The al Qaeda-linked terror group has carried out several attacks in Mandera - in an incident on October 5, six people were killed after the militants attacked a residential plot in Bulla public works in Mandera town. Police said the attackers shot randomly at the tenants who were asleep&nbsp; and that those affected were&nbsp; non locals .

"The attacks impose on economic&nbsp;sanctions in this region. They do not want us to attract investors and interact with the rest of the country," he said. "The population needs to wake up from its slumber," he said, adding they attack locals as part of a larger mission to bring Kenya down. "While they are killing in&nbsp;Somalia&nbsp;they are pretending to be targeting non-Muslims&nbsp;in Mandera, which is hypocritical," he said. He condemned the attack and condoled with victims' families. An improvised explosive device went off at the hotel at about 3.30am. Government &nbsp;spokesman&nbsp;Eric Kiraithe said part of the building collapsed, killing at least 12 of the 33 people who were inside.
