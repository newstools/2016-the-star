Persons living with disabilities have access to only a percentage of the 30 per cent of state contracts allocated to them, women and youth, due to low registration levels. The 2009 census report states the overall disability rate in Kenya is at 3.5 per cent, about 1.35 million disabled persons. The current number of registered disabled persons is slightly above 371,000. The National Council for Persons With Disabilities says formal registration is key to access the tenders and funds allocated by the government. The council attributes the low registration numbers to red tape in form of procedures required to determine whether one is qualified to be a disabled person.This includes compulsory medical assessment, which could last up to six months before the documents are cleared by the director of medical services. He is the only person mandated to do this. We are coming up with a new programme this financial year called the Local Purchasing Order Financing Guarantee fund where we give persons with disabilities or groups of persons with disabilities seed capital so that they can participate in the tenders, NCPWD programmes officer Rosabel Githinji said.The programme aims at disassociating disability with poverty through the provision of assistive devices and services, educational assistance, economic empowerment and revolving fund.
