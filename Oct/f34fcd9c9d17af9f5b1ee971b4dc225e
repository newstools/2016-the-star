Betway has partnered with Kenyan Premier League team, Mathare United as their official betting partner in a deal that will see the company continue to expand its presence throughout the African sporting landscape.Through its sponsorship, Betway aims to position the club for further success, by giving training and guidance to the club&rsquo;s operational management team and enhancing the team&rsquo;s technical capabilities with its international networks and global experience. Additionally, as part of the deal, the shirts worn by the team will bear the Betway company logo throughout the remaining part of this season and next year.Commenting on the deal, Betway Kenya Country Manager Wanja Gikonyo said, &ldquo;Our decision to sponsor Mathare United is an integral part of Betway launch strategy, focusing on the Kenyan market.&rdquo;Mathare United has produced some incredible talents over the years including their current coach Francis Kimanzi whose experience includes managing the Kenyan national squad. Celebrated former Harambee Stars captain and current Betway Ambassador, Dennis Oliech is also a product of Mathare United Football Club.Last month, Betway launched the Betway Talent Search, in which both Francis Kimanzi and Dennis Oliech will aid in the overseeing and training of 1600 aspiring Kenyan footballers.This large-scale initiative will allow scouts to screen local talent and even afford one skilled footballer the chance to visit the United Kingdom for a once-in-a-lifetime experience with the English Premier League club&mdash;West Ham United. The trip to West Ham United includes training, sightseeing, a live match and player meet and greets.Ms. Gikonyo added, &ldquo;This initiative is the first among many that Betway will be implementing in Kenya as part of our broader brand strategy.&rdquo;
