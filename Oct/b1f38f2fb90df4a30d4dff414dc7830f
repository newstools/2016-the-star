Thika deputy county commissioner Tom Anjere has ordered all landlords to keep proper records of their tenants, failing which legal action will be taken against them. He said the decision is meant to track house occupants and what they do for a living to reduce crimes.Anjere spoke in Thika Stadium during the Mashujaa Day celebrations on Thursday. It appears the measures we agreed upon with the landlords six months ago are not bearing fruit. We will embark on a proactive measure in which security teams will randomly inspect buildings.If a landlord fails to present a comprehensive record of his tenants, he will be charged in court with sabotaging the war against crime he said. Anjere urged residents to be vigilant because police officers cannot be everywhere. He said neighbours know one another and can easily detect criminals among them.
