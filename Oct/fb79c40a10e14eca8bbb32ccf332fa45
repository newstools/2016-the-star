Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has threatened to arrest Cord leader Raila Odinga and hand him over to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett.The MP said he will do so if Boinnet does not order Raila&#39;s arrest after KRA working with Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives nabbed a consignment with illegal ethanol.According to the legislator&#39;s assertions, the seized goods were destined to Spectre International - a company associated with the ODM leader.The MP, while at Difathas, Mwea East constituency for the burial of Lucy Wambui Njagi - Dennis Itumbi&#39;s aunt, said he wonders why the IG has failed to act on the matter.He accused Boinnet of playing soft on Raila for a long time.&quot;This is the same ethanol that is used to prepare second generation brews that have finished our youth,&quot; Kuria said.&quot;Raisi anajaribu kufanya kazi lakini mtu mzima kama Raila anaenda ngambo kusema wazungu wasisaidie serikali kwa sababu ya Eurobond...Wiki hii, KRA na EACC katika go-down kule Nairobi wameshika container na ethanol ya magendo na ni ya kampuni ya Spectre International ambayo ni yake. Mimi nashangaa mbona inspector general anaogopa huyu mtu,&quot; Kuria said in Swahili.Read: Take responsibility on corruption matters, Raila tells UhuruThis can be loosely translated to: &quot;The President is trying in his work but mature people like Raila Odinga are traveling abroad to incite investors against the government because Eurobond and corruption. This week in Nairobi at one go-down, KRA and EACC nabbed a consignment with illegal ethanol belonging to Specter International Company that is owned by him. I am left to wonder why the inspector general is so afraid of this man,&quot;He said it was ironic for Odinga to claim he is clean on corruption yet his company is involved in dirty business, adding that: &quot;If it was another person arrested with the said ethanol, that person could be rotting in cells already,&quot;&quot;The constitution allows citizen to arrest people they feel have violated the law. If Raila is too big to be arrested by Boinnet, let him give me the job. I will wake up very early go to his place arrest him without any harm and take him to court,&quot; Kuria said.Kuria&#39;s sentiment were echoed by Gichugu MP Njogu Barua who accused Raila of inciting Kenyans.Barua said: &quot;He has on several occasions used hate speech in his rallies and incited Kenyans but he has walked freely all through,&quot;When contacted, Raila&#39;s spokesman Dennis Onyango said they were not aware of the claims.&quot;That information belongs to Kuria. We cannot comment on such baseless rumors. We cannot and will not play such games,&quot; Onyango said.Raila left the country on Thursday for UK where he was scheduled to deliver a public lecture at the London Metropolitan University during the opening of the London Political Summit..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
