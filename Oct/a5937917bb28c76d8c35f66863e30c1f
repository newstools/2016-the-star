A company whose flier was allegedly used to drug a woman in Nairobi has accused rivals of spreading false information to tarnish its name. Reports indicated that the woman was drugged on Uhuru Highway on Thursday but she has said this was not the case.It had been said that the woman was handed a weight loss flier approved by the Nairobi City County Council while stuck in traffic.Witnesses said she shouted for help saying she had been drugged.But other motorists who took similar fliers said they did not have experiences like hers."It is a business rivalry. Those fliers belong to my family in multi-level marketing. Another team is trying to spoil our business so kindly ignore them," a woman identified only as Anne told a WhatsApp group."It is apparent that this is a case of business politics and rivalry by our competitors," further read a statement signed by several members of the group.The woman said the fliers belonged to a team of independent business owners in the health and wellness industry."This type of unethical behaviour is not condoned within the organisation as it creates questions on the integrity of our products and marketing strategies," the statement said.Members of the public had raised questions on why the motorist was the only one affected and wanted to know how she moved from the driver's seat to the back of her car, where she was photographed, in that state.The date for the licensing of the flier was indicated at December 15, 2016, showing it was not a genuine marketing tool.Police said they would investigate the incident that was widely discussed on social media.The incident came days after another where a matatu passenger revealed that staff working in the vehicle attempted to drug and kidnap her.More on this: Matatu driver who tried to drug, steal from woman to be arraigned
