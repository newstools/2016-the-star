West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin has faulted Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i over his recent remarks that county chiefs misuse public funds on foreign trips.He wants the CS to apologise to governors for &ldquo;offending them&rdquo;. Kachapin said the CS was wrong to say governors have gone for wasteful trips outside the country. He said the CS went overboard.&ldquo;What mandate does he have to tell governors not to go for trips? I have not gone for any trip this year. I have been busy trying uplift education standards through giving out bursaries and putting up infrastructure,&rdquo; Kachapin said. He said the CS should stick to his work.Matiang&rsquo;i had said governors spend a lot of money on overseas trips at the expense of the Early Childhoold Development Education.The CS urged the county chiefs to stop their &rdquo; luxurious trips&rdquo; and instead use the money to support education. &ldquo;What he said was in bad faith. He should have mentioned the names of those people he thinks have been travelling abroad ,&rdquo; Kachapin said.The county boss urged the CS to stop making statements that are &ldquo;untrue&rdquo;. &ldquo;We have witnessed many bad things, including strikes, during Matiang&rsquo;i&rsquo;s tenure,&rdquo; Kachapin said.He said the education sector is very sensitive and consultations from other stakeholders is key.&ldquo;He should involve other stakeholders or he will fail terribly. He should know that he needs our support,&rdquo; Kachapin said.
