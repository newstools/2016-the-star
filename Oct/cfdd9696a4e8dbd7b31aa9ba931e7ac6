Nairobi doctors suspended their five-week strike on Thursday following an order by the Industrial court.Union secretary general Thuranira Kaugiria said they will appear in court on Friday to answer to claims by the county that all their demands were met.Kaugiria asked the health workers to return to work until the matter has been addressed."We have suspended the strike, not called it off, as per the court order issued by Justice Monicah Mbaru," he said adding their lawyer will file a response.Kaugira said it was ironical for county secretary Robert Ayisi to sign an affidavit under oath claiming to have addressed all their needs."We are going to sue Ayisi for perjury. He cannot lie to courts that he has met our demands when he has not," he said. "We could not be protesting if our concerns had been addressed."He said the perjury suit will also be filed at the Labour and Employment Relations Court.Ayisi has maintained that the county has addressed all the issues the medics raised, including payment of Sh34 million in six-month salary arrears."The county has obtained a court order stopping the strike. We cannot allow the doctors to continue holding the county at ransom," he told journalists earlier today.The secretary said the county may resort to sacking medics who will not resume duty.More on this: Toe the line or be sacked, Nairobi doctors told as warning letters issued
