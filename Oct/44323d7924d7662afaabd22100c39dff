Garissa county employees should emulate the achievements of their colleagues from the Health department, which was recently rated as the best in Kenya, Governor Nathif Jama has said.He spoke on Saturday when he opened the Garissa Summit at a local hotel.Jama (pictured) urged health practitioners to continue working well and maintain high standards of service delivery so the department can retain the position. &ldquo;The Health department has made us proud despite the many challenges medics face,&rdquo; he said.Garissa was ranked the best performing county with the most enhanced healthcare service delivery practices.The &lsquo;Best Practices Award&rsquo; top prize was given by the Ministry of Health for major innovations that increased skilled deliveries from 36 per cent in 2013 to 45 per cent in 2015.Jama, who launched the county HIV and Aids strategic plan, urged all stakeholders to work together to stop the HIV prevalence rate from increasing. The HIV prevalence in Garissa is estimated to be on the increase from one per cent average of the Northeastern region to 2.1 per cent of the county by 2014.&ldquo;This necessitates urgent and greater need for concerted and coordinated efforts among all the sectors to address the pandemic,&rdquo; he said.Jama also awarded 85 county health workers for good work.The more than 300 casual health workers will from next week start getting official appointment letters, he said.The county will by the end of the year unveil new renal, MRI and ICU facilities at its referral hospital, Jama said.This will make the hospital fully autonomous and eliminate the need to refer patients to the Kenyatta National Hospital, he added.
