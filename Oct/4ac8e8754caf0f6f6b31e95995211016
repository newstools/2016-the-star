Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has been ordered to gazette the commencement date of the Public Benefit Organizations Act in 14 days.The order was given by High Court judge Joseph Onguto after a successful application by the Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance.The society said in its case that the Cabinet Secretary's failure to set a commencement date was illegal.The group argued that the Act was passed by Parliament in 2012 and should have been gazetted as required by law.The PBO Act sets the stage for voluntary self-regulation. This will allow PBOs to determine standards, certifications and adherence to a professional code of conduct.It also seeks to protect freedom of association.There was a proposal to amend the Act but the court said on Monday that it was illegal to do so before it is enforced.Read: Amendment to make PBO Act operational
