A 29-year-old police officer has been missing since al Shabaab militants attacked the Hamey police post in Mandera. Joab Kimeli&rsquo;s relatives, who live in Kaprengwe village, Keiyo South, say they have not heard from him or about him since the September 22 attack.They say they do not know whether he was killed or nabbed, as his phone has been off.His sister Susan Jepchirchir (pictured) said they have no information about his whereabouts. &ldquo;We appeal to the government to help. Give us his body if he is dead so we can organise burial,&rdquo; she said on September 22. Jepchirchir said they read in newspapers that the Hamey police post, where Kimeli was attached, was attacked. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; she said.Neighbour Jane Cheplak said they have been camping at Kimeli&rsquo;s home since the day they received information on his disappearance. She called on leaders to help the village in finding the missing officer. &ldquo;Kimeli was the hope of our village. We have been fasting and praying. We don&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Cheplak said.She said the village had high expectations that Kimeli, who was single, will help bring about change. &ldquo;I appeal to Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Governor Alex Tolgos to help us find our missing boy or his body if he is no more,&rdquo; Cheplak said.Village elder Wilson Limo said efforts to contact the police have been unsuccessful. &ldquo;We have contacted senior police officers through our chiefs, but they tell us to wait as the search continues,&rdquo; Limo said. He appealed to IG Joseph Boinnet to help.
