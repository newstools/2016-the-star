Busia fishermen on Lake Victoria have deplored the low fish prices in Kenya, saying they have no alternative but to market their catch in Uganda.Mulukoba Beach Management Unit vice chairman Alfred Agufwa said the Ugandan market pays Sh70 more per kilogram. We incur a lot in transporting fish to Nairobi and earn Sh70 less, he said. Agufwa spoke on Tuesday when he received a delegation from the Busia county government, led by director of administration Robert Muganda. He said in the past few days, the daily catch of fish, especially tilapia at the Mulukoba beach, has increased from 300kg to one tonne.Agufwa attributed this to rising water levels. Fishermen are happy. Our only undoing is the Kenyan market, which offers peanuts for our fish, he said. Agufwa blamed Kenyan security for allowing their Ugandan counterparts to terrorise Kenyan fishermen.
