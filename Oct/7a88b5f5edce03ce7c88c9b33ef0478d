Four Keveye Girls students were injured after students went on a rampage, vandalised property and engaged in a night-long battle with police. They were treated at a hospital and released. On Monday night they protested against the interdiction of principal Judith Ngome and demanded her return. Chaos erupted after Teachers Service Commissioners officials in Vihiga appointed deputy principal Violet Mwale as acting principal.Ngome was accused of mismanaging funds and protecting a teacher accused of having an affair with a form three student at the school. In 2014 Keveye Girls emerged top in the KCSE exam in vihiga county, with a 10.3 mean score. The students want Ngome, who was interdicted last week, reinstated and the school management committee reconstituted. The injured students were treated and released from Mbale Referral Hospital.Police surrounded the school after they were alerted of the 7.30pm violence in which the girls vandalised school property.While closing the school, Sabatia deputy subcounty administrator Isaiah Tanui said the students are still restless and they cannot be allowed to stay in the compound. &ldquo;Students said they are not happy with Ngome&rsquo;s replacement,&rdquo; he said at the school yesterday.Tanui added, &ldquo;The students are claiming Mwale is rude and they cannot accept her as their new principal.&rdquo; The decision to close the school will not affect form four candidates as they will remain in school.Sabatia education officer Alex Duro said, &ldquo;A lot of damage has been done at the school. The students who suffered minor injuries were treated and discharged,&rdquo; he said. Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i visited the school in February after a video showing Keveye teachers caning students went viral. The TSC formed a committee on February 24 to investigate the alleged brutality by teachers against in Keveye Girls. TSC county director Stephen Mudho said there were wrangles between teachers and the administration.
