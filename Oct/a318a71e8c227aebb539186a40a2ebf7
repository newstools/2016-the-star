The Jubilee Party on Tuesday urged the stateless people now being registered to get identification cards in Kwale and Kilifi to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta next year.The leaders took advantage of the registration and ID issuance to the stateless people in Kwale to campaign for Uhuru s reelection.The stateless people, according to Makonde community chairman Thomas Nguli, are between 10,000 and 15,000.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, who on Tuesday launched the registration, said their votes should go to Jubilee.He said those from Mozambique, Tanzania and Rwanda will by November 10 have their ID cards and enjoy citizenship and other benefits like other Kenyans. You must be patriotic and loyal to your country now that you are becoming Kenyan citizens, Nkaissery said in Mvindeni Good Shepherd Catholic Church grounds, Msambweni. Our officers will be in Kwale for 15 days and 3 days in Kilifi to register other stateless people. About 22,000 people are expected to get ID cards in Kwale during the two-week exercise. They include the stateless people. President Uhuru Kenyatta recently ordered that they be given ID cards by December.The CS took issue with the opposition, saying they have continued to incite Coast residents against the government over the land issue. He said its leaders did nothing when they were in power to arrest those claimed to have grabbed land. They were Prime Minister and Vice President. Why didn t they solve the land issues? If it were me who grabbed land, they should tell people, instead of inciting them, Nkaissery said.
