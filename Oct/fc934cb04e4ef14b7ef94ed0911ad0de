Over many years, I have noted that most of us are still in city mode when we enter a national park, and would like to see as much of the created wonders as possible. Our challenge is to snap out of this mode into Bush mode .This week, I thought it would be helpful to note some points that work for me. There is always something attractive about water, perhaps because it brings life. But we also seem to be fascinated by water power, like waves, waterfalls and floods. The park has several water points, dams such as the Athi dam, and seasonal streams that flow into the Mbagathi River.During the dry season, it can be rewarding to plan your visit to the park by maximising your time at various water points. For example, find a parking position that will ensure good, clear vision, so that after waiting, there will be wonderful rewards, as nature happens around you. Very often, large herds come and drink, like zebra, buffalo and Eland. It is also interesting to watch the many bird species at the same time. Occasionally, hippos and crocodiles can be seen. Sightings of predators like lions are also possible if you wait patiently. Carry some refreshments for use while waiting.The following items are also useful: the Nairobi National Park Guide Book, a good East African bird book, binoculars and a decent camera.I hope that your time waiting at the water will be worth the effort refreshing, restful and be like a soul tonic .
