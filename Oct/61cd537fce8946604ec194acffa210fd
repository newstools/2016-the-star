WhatsApp video calls put Facebook on a head-to-head basis with Apple's Facetime.The video call feature is limited at the moment to the beta version of the Android app, with iPhone users left out in this. Those using the standard version of android app rather than the Android developer version may still have to wait a while before they can make video calls on WhatsApp but can still receive video calls.Tapping the call button or contact will fire up box with both voice and video options.This is quite good keeping in mind that in Kenya, WhatsApp is the mostly used messaging app by people of all ages. The experience of holding video meetings through your own device has been improved as we get into this technological future. The update means that WhatsApp is on its way to joining the range of major messaging services that offer video calling, including Microsoft's Skype and Google's new Duo app.For those who have installed version 2.16.318, the feature seems to work well that is according to a statement from a statement read from Daily Mail's Android police.It is likely that the feature will be available on iOS once WhatsApp has finished testing running it.WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger were declared as some of the most secure messaging apps to use, that was according to a report by Amnesty International just last week.The report ranked 11 companies that run the world's most popular messaging apps, including Skype, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger.
