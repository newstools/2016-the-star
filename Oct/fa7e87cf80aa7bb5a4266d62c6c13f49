Luckily, I had seen the campaign s advert on a billboard, so I scratched the bottle, sent the code and forgot about it."I was therefore surprised when I received a call from KBL, informing me that I had won the grand prize."He added, I was overjoyed and immediately called my wife to share the good news. Although I have always desired to have a newer car, I never imagined that I could be the owner of a brand new car this soon."I intend to keep it as an asset that will not only ease my movement, but also help grow my business."DJ Creepa Global was on the wheels of steel to offer the much-needed entertainment at the party.See the photos below.DJ Creepa Global on the decks.KBL's Andrew Kilonzo and Angela Maiyo with grand winner Owen Karanja.Ian Kirumba with Subaru Kenya's Timothy Maina and Owen Karanja.Owen Karanja admires his new ride.Photos/MOSES MWANGI
