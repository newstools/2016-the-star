The two arms of the county government are in a tussle over office space at City Hall. The assembly has claimed the Northern Wing, from the basement parking to the fifth floor.Last September, speaker Alex ole Magelo gazetted the Northern Wing as the county assembly s precincts and asked Governor Evans Kidero s team to relocate its 400 staff.But on Monday, the employees, under the County Government Workers Union, threatened to down their tools if they are evicted. The assembly has secured the wing and erected a perimeter fence.Union branch secretary Boniface Waweru said the 400 workers will be inconvenienced and key services disrupted if the eviction is carried out.On Tuesday Magelo and clerk Jacob Ngwele said the assembly has been meeting the executive for two years to relocate its staff.Magelo asked the executive to relocate its staff to City Annex, where the county recently evicted tenants after winning a court case.
