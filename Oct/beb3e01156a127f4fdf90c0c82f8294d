The plan by the five-nation East African Community to have a single currency by 2024 is still on course, the bloc&rsquo;s secretary general Liberat Mfumukeko says. He said the process of setting up four key institutions to support the implementation of the EAC Monetary Union protocol, which was signed on November 30, 2013, has started. The institutions include EAC Monetary Institute, EAC Statistics Bureau, EAC Financial Services Commission and EAC Surveillance, Compliance and Enforcement Commission. &ldquo;The establishment of a strong Monetary Union will require a robust institutional framework to ensure compliance and safeguard the convergence process,&rdquo; he said in Arusha. &ldquo;The dream is to have East Africans trade easily using any of their currencies and eventually have an East African common currency.&rdquo;Mfumukeko said a single currency will bolster trade where free movement of persons using identification cards has taken momentum in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. &ldquo;I am sure that shortly this will be the norm in all the countries after the necessary processes are complete,&rdquo; said the EAC chief, adding that by 2017, the International East African Electronic passport will be in use. The countries are issuing work permits free of charge, Mfumukeko said.
