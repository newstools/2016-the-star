The Ilchamus should support the Jubilee Party or the community will remain out in the cold after next year s election, Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi (pictured) has said. Leaders from the Ilchamus community have for many years been misleading the residents to remain in the opposition, he said. The community has mostly been voting for ODM. Cheboi spoke to residents on Wednesday as he inspected county projects in Illchamus ward, Baringo South. He was with Ilchamus MCA Wesley Lekakimon, who is also the area ODM chairman.
