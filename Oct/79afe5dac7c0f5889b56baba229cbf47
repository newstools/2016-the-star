The Murang a government has started demarcating Mjini slum in Murang a town to issue residents with lease documents and foster development in the area.Governor Mwangi Wairia, who visited the slum on Wednesday, said all the 186 plots will be marked with beacons.The majority of Muslims who live in the slum have complained that previous administrations having abandoned them, forcing them to live in makeshift homes for lack of land ownership documents.The more than 2,500 people said they were the first inhabitants of Murang a town after travelling with the first colonial governor of the town Francis Hall from the Coast in 1884.During the Id ul Fitr celebrations in July, resident Abdullahi Ali said their ancestors were allocated the land by the colonial governor and later intermarried with Kikuyu women.He said after independence, authorities did not issue them with lease documents.Ali said lack of ownership documents has forced the community to live in abject poverty. We have been neglected as a minority community in Murang a county. Mjini estate was planned during the colonial government and has not been redesigned, he said.Wairia said it is unfair for the community to live in deplorable conditions.He said once the lease documents are issued, residents will put up better houses.The governor urged residents to use the documents to be issued by December to borrow money from financial institutions and put up commercial buildings. The Murang a University of Technology recently got a charter and will be enrolling close to 10,000 students. They will need accommodation, Wairia said.
