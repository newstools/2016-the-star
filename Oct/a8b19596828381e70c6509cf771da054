Embakasi East MP John Omondi and his political rival Francis Mureithi yesterday sponsored a group of girls from the Pipeline Estate to train in Karate and Tae Kwon Do to help them fight rapists. The MP said society should not discriminate against women. Women are vulnerable and mostly people think they are weak. We are empowering our girls with basic self-defence skills to fight muggers, would-be rapists and other bad people, Omondi said. He urged the youth to engage more in development, instead of being idle. Mureithi, seeking to unseat Omondi, said he supports the initiative to train the girls in martial arts. This is an initiative that as a leader I have no option but to support. It s a youth empowerment initiative that unites all residents, he said. Businessman Walter Ajira, who owns a gym on Pipeline, asked politicians to support the youth.
