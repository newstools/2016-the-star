These challenges range from a depressed economy, higher operating costs and extraneous factors including enhanced risk management due to prevailing security threats, he said.The MD said the factors have impacted negatively on the business although support from staffers, suppliers and customers has helped it to remain operational.To this end, he said that they have embarked on a re-organizational strategy, including renegotiating contractual agreements with suppliers, to enable the retailer to safely wade through the turmoil. We have been actively engaging our suppliers to review current supply terms. We are also undertaking a management enhancement programme that involves recruiting and retaining management personnel to handle specialized units including commercial, supply chain, finance and marketing, said Shah.According to the MD, the company has also integrated an advanced warehouse management system that will allow the business to hold optimum stocks based on daily demands of individual branches to cut on losses.
