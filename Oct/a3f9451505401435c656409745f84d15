Western Stima claimed a memorable 2-2 draw against Gor Mahia in a Premier League match played at Nyayo Stadium yesterdayThe sense of foreboding for the champions, who are now six points adrift of overwhelming favourites Tusker with four matches left to play, came in first half stoppage time when Stima took the lead largely against the run of play.Herbert Kompany, a former Gor youngster sent an inviting cross that Kennedy Otieno gleefully buried past Boniface Oluoch. It was a sense of de javu once again for the K Ogalo faithful as it was Otieno s goal four years ago that ended Gor s championship hopes as Tusker claimed the 2012 title on the last day of the campaign.Those fears were briefly eased five minutes after the break when Jacques Tuyisenge was brought down in the box by Joash Onyango, allowing Enock Agwanda to fire in the resultant spot kick past Gabriel Andika. By then Gor Mahia had been forced to reshuffle their pack as captain Musa Mohamed limped off to be replaced by Innocent Wafula. Having drawn level, Gor went all out in search of a winner that would keep them breathing down the necks of the table toppers.Tuyisenge still without a league goal in the second leg brought a superlative save from Andika who also denied Eric Ouma with an hour played. Kennedy Muguna nearly punished Gor s Lung aho approach with a breakaway goal but as he has done so often in this campaign. Bernard Ondiek denied Gor victory at the death.
