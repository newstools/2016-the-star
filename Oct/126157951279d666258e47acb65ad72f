Meru Governor Peter Munya has unanimously been elected PNU party leader succeeding former president Mwai Kibaki.Munya was elected at the National Delegates Congress that was held at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Friday.President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s newly formed Jubilee Party suffered a major setback after the Political Parties Tribunal annulled its merger with PNU.The Tribunal overturned the decision of the Registrar of Political Parties to dissolve PNU for the JP merger, saying the party had not approved.The move came as a relief to Munya, who was seeking to replace Kibaki as the party's chairman, and field candidates for elective posts in the 2017 general election.Munya welcomed the verdict to reinstate PNU as a party and said their congress would take place as planned. But he noted they will support the President's re-election.The case had been filed by party secretary general John Okemwa.Read: Parties Registrar barred from declaring PNU as merged with Jubilee PartyAlso read: PNU&rsquo;s dissolution is illegal, tribunal rules
