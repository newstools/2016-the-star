Kenya has formed a high-powered team of seven Cabinet Secretaries will engage in shuttle diplomacy to campaign for Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed to clinch the chairman of the African Union Commission.Education CS Fred Matiangi is chairing the team. Others are Najib Balala (Tourism), Judy Wakhungu (Environment), Mohammed Adan (Trade), Sicily Kariuki (Public Service), Henry Rotich (Treasury) and Raychelle Omamo (Defence). They are due to travel to various countries to try to secure commitment for Amina's support.President Uhuru Kenyatta, who proposed Amina, has also been engaged in diplomacy with several heads of state. He is expected to extract a commitment from Tanzania President John Magufuli, who is expected to visit Kenya on Monday.Magufuli, whose country is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community, is likely to have received a request from SADC member Botswana, which is also fronting a candidate for the top AU position. There are five candidates. The other three are from Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea.There has been concerns that Kenya's chances may be hurt by the fact that the deputy head of the AU Erastus Mwencha is also Kenyan. But the government has clarified he has served his two terms totalling eight years and will be exiting the AU during the coming election.The election will be held next January at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
