The government has assured Kenyans the country has enough food, even as 1.3 million people face starvation.Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday said, &ldquo;We expect to get 34 million bags from the long rains harvest. We also anticipate that the short rains harvest will add another seven million bags, bringing our production to par with consumption levels.&rdquo;Maize consumption stands at 3.2 million bags per month, and 40 million bags annually.A report by the Tegemeo Institute released this month warned of a possible maize shortage in May next year. Analysis was carried out in Bungoma, Busia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kakamega, Nakuru, Nandi, Narok, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and Migori.The report attributed the shortage to La Ni&ntilde;a and the drought in about 23 counties.According to the National Drought Management Authority, the most affected counties include Garissa, Kajiado, Kilifi, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Makueni, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Tana River and Wajir.The situation has been made worse by resource-based conflicts, especially on the borders of Isiolo and Garissa; Marsabit and Wajir; Turkana and Ethiopia; Tana Delta and parts of Samburu county.Yesterday Bett said the current maize stock stands at 9.5 million bags, with most of the stocks being held by farmers.The National Cereals and Produce Board currently holds 731,000 bags of maize, with cash equivalent to purchase two million bags.&ldquo;The cereals board has started purchasing maize from farmers in the main production areas at Sh2,800 ( 90kg) bag in order to increase strategic reserve stocks,&rdquo; Bett said.&ldquo;The expected available stocks combined with stocks of other staples will be enough to last the country up to around June, 2017.&rdquo;
