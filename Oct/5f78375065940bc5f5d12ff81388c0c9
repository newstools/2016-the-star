Former leader of the February Eighteen Revolution Army Patrick Wangamati wants the government to recognise him as a hero for fighting for multiparty democracy.He said leaders are enjoying the multiparty system because of him. Wangamati questioned why President Uhuru Kenyatta did to recognise him during the Mashujaa Day celebrations last week.Wangamati, a nominated MP, said he was tortured and forced into exile in early 90s for fighting against one-party rule. He said he was shocked to hear the President mention other people who did little to liberate Kenya.&ldquo;I was forced into exile in Ghana for four years through Uganda because President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s regime didn&rsquo;t want the multiparty system, but even though I was in exile, we mounted pressure until he accepted,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wangamati said.Speaking at his Khachonge home on Tuesday, he accused the government of being discriminatory in recognising its heroes and heroines.He said the government should recognise the real freedom fighters. Wangamati said most of those who fought to liberate Kenya are not being appreciated. He said the Dini ya Musambwa sect fought for the liberation of the nation, yet the government does not recognise its leaders.
