Kisumu MCAs have urged the executive to register all county assets to protect them against illegal acquisition.Speaker Ann Adul on Tuesday said the county risks losing billions of shillings in assets through the illegal possession of property still under the now-defunct Local Authority.She said the old Transition Authority was supposed to compile a list of assets, but did not complete its job. We want the executive to fast-track the registration and present the list to the assembly for adoption, Adul said.She spoke during her ruling on a petition by traders from Central Kolwa in Kisumu East constituency.They complained about the alleged illegal allocation to private developers of their ancestral land donated to residents to build a market in 1949.The assembly s joint committee on planning, housing and trade investigated and recommended that the National Land Commission revoke the existing title deed.It ordered the initiation of a fresh process of legally reclaiming the land. The committee recommended the private developer stop further activity and vacate the land. This is after the private developer Akiyda 2000 Ltd failed to submit legal documents and minutes from the old Local Authority indicating all relevant procedures were followed to acquire the land.Committee chairman Charles Aguko said there was malice in the acquisition, which called for revocation of the title deed. Adul ordered the executive to ensure members of the Ong wano market, who pay rates, are accommodated elsewhere while the matter is resolved. The Transition Authority early this month was accused of shambolic work when it compiled the register of assets and liabilities inherited by the county governments. The Council of Governors said the TA did not do a good job.
