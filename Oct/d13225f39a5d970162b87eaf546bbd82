The Kenya Prisons Service has defended an ex-convict who allegedly stole offerings at a church barely two days after he was released from Laikipia GK prison.Senior deputy commissioner general of prisons Florence Omundi said Lucas Njoroge was getting back change after depositing Sh1000 into the alms till."It was misconstrued that he intended to steal. Njoroge had Sh1000 and wanted to give Sh100 so he dipped his hand into the offering basket to fetch Sh900 change," she said. "What would you have expected him to have done? He had only Sh1000 note and sincerely wanted to give Sh100 to God and he doesn t have change. And he knew the offertory basket does not come back," Omundi asked. She said that Njoroge, having stayed in prison for some time, may not have known that one doesn t take the change by himself.Omundi said the congregation at the Ol Jabet African Independent Pentecostal Church had adjudged Njuguna and expected him to steal."Remember you don t know everybody in the church but you can imagine that this particular congregation was even able to know that this is the man who had come from prison the other day," she said."They should be helping him reform by pointing out to him that this is not how things are done," Omundi said."We are talking of disconnect. A lot has happened since this man went to prison, so he needs orientation," she said, adding that the community needs to support such persons re-integrate.Omundi said stigmatisation of ex-prisoners is still prevalent in most societies, further calling for a change of attitude towards them. She said the society judges the lot harshly instead of correcting and guiding them.Njoroge was among more than 7000 petty offenders pardoned by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Mashujaa Day on Thursday, October 20.
