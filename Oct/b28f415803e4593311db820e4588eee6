Liquid Telecoms-owned East African Data Centre yesterday said it hopes the Sh500 million Kenya Power substation at its premises will help it reduce the expensive diesel fuel from 15 to three per cent.This is because the telco expects to source 97 per cent of its power from Kenya Power&rsquo;s green energy.&ldquo;For EADC, the move to secure 97 per cent availability of Kenya Power&rsquo;s unusually green electricity has now positioned the data centre as an exceptionally sustainable option, offering it a competitive advantage over data centres elsewhere in Africa,&rdquo; East African Data Centre chief executive Dan Kwacha said.
