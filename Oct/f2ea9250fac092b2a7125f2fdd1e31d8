"My utterances were altered in the edited clip to depict my social, political and influence based position as challenging&nbsp;the presidency," he said in a statement on Saturday. He said&nbsp;the footage were drawn to "delineate&nbsp;his character" and tarnish his name based on his political inclination. "This was further&nbsp;fueled&nbsp;by the seemingly bitter rivalry between my party and the wrangling Cord detach which was ably represented," he said. Sonko's comments compelled DPP&nbsp; Keriako Tobiko to&nbsp;direct&nbsp;IG Joseph Boinnet to&nbsp;question&nbsp;his utterances.

He said it was&nbsp; a "shame that the DPP would be influenced to act on such claims." " It's an act of incompetence.&nbsp; We will release the acquired footage for national transparency," he said. Kenyans on Twitter and leaders alike accused the Senator of allegedly committing treason.
