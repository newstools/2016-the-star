Kibra MP Kenneth Okoth was forced to cut short a speech yesterday after angry youths jeered and pelted him with stones. Okoth and Lang ata MP Joash Olum were at the launch of an ultramodern academic block at the Raila Education Centre in Kibra.Trouble began when the youths questioned why Cord leader Raila Odinga was not at the event, why Okoth publicised the project as state-funded and why he placed banners bearing his portrait on a red background. This project was initiated by Baba. He looked for international partners who have helped built it. For Okoth to brand it a government project is an insult. We won t entertain it, resident Joseph Otieno said.Resident Micheal Odunga said, Look at the colours. The plaque, the block and the tents are all in red. You don t have to be a PhD holder to know this is a JP marketing event.
