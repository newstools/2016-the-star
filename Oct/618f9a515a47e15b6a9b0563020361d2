The anti-graft agency will complete initial investigations into graft allegations at Moi University by next week. More than 30 top managers and employees have been questioned by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over the loss of more than Sh5 billion and other irregularities. The initial report is to be forwarded to EACC chief executive Halakhe Waqo, who had given investigators three weeks to hand in the first report. Part of the money suspected to have been embezzled includes Sh600 million belonging to the Moi University Pension Scheme. We are following up on an audit report on several issues at the university, EACC senior deputy director Enock Otiko said. Investigators have also questioned members of the Moi University Council and are expected to extend the probe to the Rift Valley Textile Company, owned by the university.
