West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo and Tiaty MP Asman Kamama clashed yesterday over who should be the Pokot spokesman. The fight for control of the community is between Jubilee and Kanu.The tussle follows Lonyangapuo s (Kanu) installion as the spokesman on October 15. Kamama (Jubilee) said the senator has no capacity and ability to lead the community. What I know is that he was installed by Kanu aspirants, not elected leaders. Declaring himself the spokesman is cheap politics intended to promote Kanu because his installation was not based on the will of the people, Kamama said. He said Lonyangapuo paid for his anointment. The traditional regalia he was given was bought for Sh3,000, yet it is given for free in the Pokot culture. If he wants to be the spokesman, he should seek the support of elected leaders, which will not be easy because he undermines them using aspirants, Kamama said.He said the community has Deputy President William Ruto as its only spokesman and John Mwok as Council of Elders chairman.Kamama said Kanu is a bridge to the past, not the future. He said this was exemplified by the suffering the community went through during the Kanu era.Lonyangapuo s installation was in Amaya ward, Tiaty constituency. Former Kacheliba MP and minister Samuel Poghisio, who wants to succeed the senator on the Kanu ticket, was present.Lonyangapuo wants to be governor. Before he defected to Kanu, Poghisio was Ruto s staunch ally and a member of URP before the party folded alongside Uhuru s TNA to form the Jubilee party.
