A planned impeachment of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua (pictured) was on Tuesday dealt a blow after reports went round that some MCAs had secretly withdrawn their signatures from the petition. Initially, reports said that 46 out of 59 assembly members signed the petition to sack Mutua.But Masinga Central MCA Joshua Mwonga, who was sacked as majority leader, said those opposed to the governor do not have the numbers to impeach him as 26 other MCAs oppose Mutua s sacking.
