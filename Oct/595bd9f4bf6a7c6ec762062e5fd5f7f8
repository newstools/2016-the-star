Inform Tusker striker Allan Wanga has earned a recall into the national soccer team, Harambee Stars for the first time under coach Stanley Okumbi as he was included among the 25 home-based players, who will go into camp next week ahead of Kenya s twin international friendlies against Mozambique and Liberia.Wanga has been in sensational form on his return to Tusker, the club where he made his name and led them to the title in 2007, winning the Golden Boot award the same season.The striker s fortunes, however, took a nosedive in the last two years when he moved to Tanzania, where he struggled for form and fitness, losing his spot as the lead striker for the national team. However, his recent streak in the goal-scoring stakes has made his return necessary with Stars lacking a back up striker to Michael Olunga with Jesse Were yet to find his scoring boots for the national team.Also back in the line up is Osborne Monday, Wanga s team-mate at the GOtv Shiled champions, whose powers appeared to be waning after a horrific knee injury that kept him out for the better part of last season. Four second division players Morven Otinya (Palos), Lawrence Juma (Nzoia Sugar) and the duo of Bernard Ochieng and Michael Misigo who turn out for Vihiga United have also been named in the preliminary squad for the first time.Others who will vie to win their first international caps in the friendlies are Mathare United left back David Mwangi, Bandari s Darius Msagha as well as Posta Rangers duo of striker Duncan Otieno and right back Simon Mbugua. Thika United midfielder Michael Mutinda had been considered in the initial preliminary squad but was omitted in the final list of players who will be going into residential training. Whereas the technical bench had included the player (Michael Mutinda) in the tentative list, he was not considered for the final list and as a result, has not been called up for the two upcoming Harambee Stars matches, read a clarification note from the federation.Squad Goalkeepers: Boniface Oluoch, David Okello, James Saruni, Patrick Matasi; Defenders: Musa Mohammed (Gor), Joackins Atudo (Rangers) Erick Ouma (Gor), Simon Mbugua, (Rangers) Robinson Kamura (Mathare) David Mwangi (Mathare) Bernard Ochieng (Vihiga), Harun Shakava (Gor); Midfielders: Kenneth Muguna (W.
