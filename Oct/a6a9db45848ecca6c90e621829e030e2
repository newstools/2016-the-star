The eight ODM MPs who defected to Jubilee party could lose their parliamentary seats if the Registrar of Political Parties ratifies the decision of the party's disciplinary committee.The report of the committee chaired by Fred Athuok was unanimously adopted by the National Executive Committee meeting on Sunday at Orange house.Though there are claims that some of the MPs may be pardoned, the national governing council is expected to give their say in a meeting at Bomas of Kenya on Monday.The MPs are among them Ababu Namwamba (Budalang'i), Steven Kariuki (Mathare), John Waluke (Sirisia), Samuel Arama (Nakuru West), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East).Others are Isaac Mwaura (nominated) and Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale woman rep).Read: ODM wants by-elections for defectors "The committee has been investigating the leaders who publicly defected to other political parties and it found out that they violated the party's constitution and the political parties constitution," Agnes Zani, ODM acting secretary general, said.Some of the MPs and other leaders were paraded by deputy president during the launch of the Jubilee party in September this year.Last week, the MPs were de-whipped from the National Assembly committees with the exception of Chidzuga and Arama who had been removed from the committees earlier.
