DJ Creme's latest jam titled Hadi Lini ft Wahu and Sudi Boy is already proving to be a major hit in Kenya. It's video though has people talking about the mixmaster's connection to the secret society Illuminati. In the video, Creme makes some hand expressions that have been linked to the occult-like organisation. We sought him out to shed some light on the controversial issue.  Are you really Illuminati? "Hahaha... Am I Illuminati for making the hand sign Not at all," he said during an interview with Word Is. He added, "It's just an expression that I like doing. There's nothing more to it." At the same time, Creme addressed the scandals that have marred his career in the recent times, particularly his leaked sex-tape and his deportation from the US. "I have already moved on from all that. My focus right now is to take this industry to new levels. "We are all human and we have our mistakes and I have learned from them. It's all in the past now," he said. During the interview, Wahu dismissed the notion that she got into marriage for wrong reasons. From time to time, her 11-year celebrity union with singer Nameless has been a subject of scrutiny from some quarters. Rumours about the two breaking up have graced gossip headlines for years now, with some pointing that the marriage between the two stars "died" a long time ago. "From the onset, my husband has been my best friend. "Yes sometimes things might get difficult, but he's always had me. He always has my back," she said. "It has been a fantastic journey for me as a wife and a mother. No regrets whatsoever. "I know people talk a lot about celebrity marriages, but for me, I never got into marriage for showbiz," she adds. The two said that they were "extremely busy" working on new projects.
