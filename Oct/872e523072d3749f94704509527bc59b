Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale has lauded former Gichugu MP Martha Karua for standing strong against the pressure to join the Jubilee Party.On Thursday, the Senator referred to the former legislator's steadfast political stance as "being the man in Mount Kenya region"."Jubilee has ended up consolidating [President Uhuru Kenyatta's] Mt Kenya that even Peter Kenneth has decided to support him, it is only Karua who has stood like a man and decided not to join the party," he said.Khalwale said the consolidation of parties to form one party by Uhuru and DP William Ruto has given life to Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto's Chama cha Mashinani."The only thing which we will now witness is the growth of Mashinani party as the DP's base in Rift valley becomes weaker with time," Khalwale added.Khalwale's sentiments were echoed by his Mombasa counterpart Omar Hassan who said the merger of 11 parties into Jubilee was the beginning of the end for Uhuru's administration.Omar, who was with Khalwale at the Citizen TV's breakfast show, said disgruntled members of the JP are already complaining of lack of party leadership."I can call on them to keep calm because once the Cord coalition identifies a flagbearer, we will wake up to a new leadership then on August 9, 2017," he said.Kiambu senator Kimani Wamatangi however said Jubilee party will last beyond 2022.He asked the members to focus on building and popularising the new party ahead of the 2017 general election."Those who dissolved parties should let the past go and now focus on building our new home as our party leaders guide us through appointment of party officials," he said.Leaders who dissolved their parties to join Jubilee party have been complaining of being abandoned by President Uhuru and DP William Ruto.Led by Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka and former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile, the leaders claim that the party does not give any importance to their opinion.The group wants new party officials named to end anxiety within the party.Read: Scramble for positions in Jubilee Party
