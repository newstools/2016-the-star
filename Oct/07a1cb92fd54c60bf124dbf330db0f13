Kenya is looking forward to win the war against cancer following the entry of new players out to deal with the scourge that has claimed many lives.The launch of the Beth Mugo Cancer Foundation has been hailed as among the positive steps that the country has taken towards tackling the disease.Working with Roche Pharmaceutical Company, the foundation will train oncologists, improve diagnosis of the disease and make cancer drugs available.First Lady Margaret Kenyatta said on Monday that there is need to change the current cancer narrative from a &lsquo;death sentence&rsquo; to a message of triumph and hope.She was the chief guest at the launch held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC).&quot;I believe that if we all join hands, we can create a narrative of survival, victory, triumph and hope for cancer patients in our country,&quot; Margaret said.She said the new foundation would provide not just preventive and treatment procedures, but hope that Kenyans can together defeat cancer.&quot;We come together to play our part in changing the narrative around cancer,&quot; Margaret said at the function that was also attended by Mama Ngina Kenyatta.Senator Mugo is a cancer survivor who was among the first high-ranking state officials who went public about their status despite the stigma associated with the disease.&nbsp;The Foundation has over the past few days been providing free screening for breast, cervical and prostrate cancers.For the first time, men turned up in large numbers at the Comesa grounds outside the KICC for screening.The First Lady said the foundation is a continuation of a long held mission that Senator Mugo has pursued for many years.&quot;As minister, she spearheaded the development of the National Cancer Control Strategy (2011-2016) and the enactment of the Cancer Prevention and Control Act (2012) which entails the establishment of the National Cancer Institute of Kenya, which is already in place,&quot; Margaret said.The First Lady noted that there is an increase in the number of patients during turning up for activities to mark cancer awareness month of October every year.&quot;There are already an estimated 1.36 million people living with cancer in Africa, and it is estimated that more than half of the world&rsquo;s new cancer cases will occur in our continent by the year 2030,&quot; the First Lady said.She said the disease, which is currently on the increase, holds Kenyans back from the socio-economic success.This, she said, is by the scourge eating away the innovative and productive potential, the hard-earned investments of families and the futures of many little children.The First Lady said Kenyans can alleviate the suffering and avoidable deaths through awareness and regular screening for early detection.&quot;We must no longer agree to diagnose this disease at advanced stages when the chances of survival are minimal,&quot; she added.She announced the donation of a fully kitted mobile clinic by Beyond Zero initiative to the new foundation.The clinic is sponsored by Aga Khan Hospital to help facilitate cancer screening in areas where health facilities are not easily accessible.Health CS Cleopa Mailu cautioned county governments against charging for services provided by mammogram and Ultra-Sound machines.Mailu said the machines are an investment of the national government&nbsp; in efforts to deal with the terminal disease.&quot;Nobody should take the opportunity to make money from these machines,&quot; Mailu said.Senator Mugo expressed optimism that Kenyans can eventually conquer cancer especially if they embrace early screening.&quot;I have no doubt we are going to conquer the disease,&quot; she said.Mugo gave an emotional testimony about her battle with cancer including crying openly with joy when she was finally declared cancer-free by doctors after months of chemotherapy.Others who spoke at the function include health PS Dr Nicholas Muraguri and the Head of Roche Sub-Saharan Africa Markus Gemuend.&nbsp;
