Chief Justice David Maraga has said 10 per cent of judiciary staff are corrupt and are responsible for tainting the name of the institution.A day after President Uhuru Kenyatta expressed his concern over failure by the judiciary to speed up corruption cases, the CJ said he is ready to tackle the vice head-on.Maraga said judges and junior judiciary staff are involved in corruption. He said this has turned the judiciary into a punching bag.He said the Office of the Ombudsman will be strengthened to investigate corruption cases."The office will investigate corruption cases and later hand them to the Judicial Service Commission. I will take decisive action against any judge found guilty," Maraga said.He said accused judges would be given ample time to defend themselves. The CJ urged them to partner with him in fighting graft.Maraga was addressing High Court judges at the end of a four-day workshop at the Great Rift Valley Lodge in Naivasha.He said the President and Deputy President have raised concern over statutory orders been issued by some judges.Maraga said some of the orders are hurting development projects and funding.He urged the judges to be bear in mind the consequences of their orders."The President and Deputy President have a point on these orders and they are challenging us to be fast in issuing judgements as we do with injunctions," Maraga said.He said during his vetting by Parliament, he responded to MPs' complaints that the judiciary interferes with their duties."I reminded them that the courts have no such jurisdiction," Maraga said.He said there are more than 600,000 cases pending in courts across the country, some lasting for more than 10 years.Maraga said he has set up an advisory committee to address the backlog. He said they will start with cases that are more than five years old."We plan to address and resolve these cases in one year and I'm appealing to you judges to be firm and ensure we deal with the backlog," he said.The CJ, who was speaking in his first public function, said there is a huge outcry from the public over the high number of pending cases."You are the face of the judiciary and I urge you to dispense with the cases as some are holding back businesses and affecting investments," he said.
