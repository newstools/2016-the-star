It is no secret that the ministry of Health has long been treated as a personal ATM by various unidentified tenderpreneurs , usually referred to collectively as the Afya House Cartels .Indeed, the building which houses this ministry has at times been defined as Mafia House given that it had a long-established reputation as a place where shadowy and ruthless figures are the people really in charge. And it has been alleged that those senior officials of that ministry who try to oppose these cartels, end up being transferred very quickly to some less prestigious post.This goes back all the way to the Moi era, back to the 1990s. And Afya House has been the preferred target for these crooks, precisely because the government out of the best possible motives allocates large sums of money toward giving Kenyans the benefits of a functional public health system. Well, this latest scandal at the ministry of Health comes at a time when our President has publicly expressed his willingness to go to any extreme to end the ravages of corruption on the government's ability to serve Kenyans.The whole nation now waits to see if maybe, at last, the Afya House Cartels will have met their match in President Uhuru Kenyatta.
