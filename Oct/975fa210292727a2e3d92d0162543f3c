About 100 beneficiaries of Property Reality Company&rsquo;s Kilimo Biashara project will this month get Sh12 million in dividend payout from the agribusiness venture for its landowners. This is PRC's first dividend payout since it started the agribusiness real estate at the beginning of the year. The firm said it has realised a steady growth in the pilot agribusiness-real estate project which has 60 greenhouses, with about 70 per cent of investors being women. &ldquo;It has been a good trajectory for both us and our customers,&rdquo; PRC chief executive Brian Gacari yesterday said in Nairobi. The project has been running in the last 10 months in Aberdare View, Laikipia county.The next phase of the project, set to commence in January 2017, will be carried out in the same area.
