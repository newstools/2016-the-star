Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of dictatorship.He said the party lacks democracy and is threatening to kick out rebels. &ldquo;We read in the media about letters we have &lsquo;received&rsquo; from the party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee. We have not received any letter and we treat that as mere propaganda,&rdquo; he said yesterday during an interview with the Star.Arama said rebels still pay Sh20,000 monthly contributions to the party. &ldquo;If they were true to their word, why are they still receiving our money? If they are genuine, they should have stopped,&rdquo; he said.Arama denied claims the rebels were paid cash to join the Jubilee Party. &ldquo;Why should some people claim I received Sh5 million to join JP? That&rsquo;s my two months salary,&rdquo; he said.
