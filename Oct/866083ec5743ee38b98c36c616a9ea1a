Mwingi Central MP aspirant Eric Mutua has claimed his life is in danger after his motorcade was blocked by two vehicles with the help of police officers.The former LSK president said his motorcade was blocked by six vehicles allegedly belonging to former Public Works PS Gideon Mulyungi, who is also eying the seat.Mutua said he was asked to report to Mwingi police station but that assistance was delayed because the orders were reportedly from the OCPD. I demanded that a report be entered in the OB but there was resistance, he said. This was eventually done with the intervention of the OCS who was new at the station. We recorded statements on October 22."In a statement on Monday, Mutua asked IG Joseph Boinnet to investigate the officers to prevent cases of damage to property and danger to lives. I call on the IG and IPOA to investigate the conduct of police in Mwingi with a view to commencing disciplinary proceedings or transferring those involved," he said.The aspirant threatened to mobilise residents in a demonstration from Mwingi bus terminus to the police station on November 7 if the matter is not addressed in court.He said several complaints have been lodged against Mulyungi but that no action has been taken."Any complaint against him is dealt with in the most uncivil manner," he claimed.He cited a June 19 incident in which one of his supporters was arrested for assaulting one Dennis Muthui. Social media carried reports he and his supporters invaded a police post in Mwingi, compromised the officers and unlawfully secured his release," he said.Mulyungi did not respond to a phone call and message for comment on the allegations.
