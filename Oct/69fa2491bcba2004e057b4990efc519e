Mandera residents want the national government to fulfil its promise in addressing the recurring power shortages, Governor Ali Roba has said.Power outages have driven away investors and made it easy for terrorists to attack when the county is in darkness, he said. The past terrorist attacks experienced in Mandera always take place in the darkest areas within the county and during power outages, Roba said.Among the investors affected is a Chinese juice processor who was set to begin his operations in January and an abattoir, he said.Speaking to journalists in Mandera, Roba said the frequent outages are a result of low power supply that leads to rationing. Power supply in Mandera county is so low that it cannot meet household needs, leave alone industrial needs, the governor said.He added that during President Uhuru Kenyatta s visit to the county in May, he promised the state would solve electricity outages in a week, but this has not been resolved six months after the visit.Roba said he is also disappointed with Kenya Power, saying it has misguided priorities after it launched a Sh1 billion project in Nandi. The other day the power company launched a 40MW solar project in an area that is not affected by power outages, yet a whole county still lacks enough household power, he said.The KPLC station in Mandera produces 1500KW of electricity, which causes an overstretch in addressing the power supply needs of the growing population, an official at the station said.The station also relies on diesel-powered generators to produce electricity in the county as it is not connected to the national grid.The generator also broke down as it is old and in a poor state, a source said.
