The Capital Markets Authority has inked a cooperation agreement with the Australian Securities Investment Commission in a bid to promote innovation in the closely monitored financial services. The deal, signed this week on the sidelines of International Organisation of Securities Commissions&rsquo; board meeting in Hong Kong, allows the two to share information on emerging market trends and regulatory issues arising from the rapidly rising innovations. &ldquo;We are committed to facilitating innovation in financial services, leveraging on Kenya&rsquo;s positioning in the region as an innovation centre,&rdquo; CMA chief executive Paul Muthaura said in a statement on Friday. &ldquo;This, however, calls for us to assess lessons learned and to compare strategies to balance innovation and regulation with our peer regulators.&rdquo; The Australian counterpart, ASIC, launched an Innovation Hub in 2015 that has seen an up surge in requests by financial technology start-ups seeking regulatory help. The regulator wants to establish a Regulatory Sandbox to allow start-ups to test their concepts without a licence.
