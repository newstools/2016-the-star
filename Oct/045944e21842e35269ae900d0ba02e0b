Kisii MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache North) &nbsp;and Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache) have &nbsp;rejoined ODM weeks after decamping to Jubilee Party. Onyonka said JP, led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, had broken its promises to him.&quot;We have realised nothing is going to be done, that the country is taking the wrong direction... t hat we would rather stay in ODM and work with the party,&quot; he said. He apologised to members of the party led by opposition chief Raila Odinga and thanked them for welcoming him back. &quot;I take this opportunity to apologise to Raila and&nbsp;all ODM members,&quot; he told a cheering&nbsp;crowd during the party&#39;s meeting at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Monday. Onyonka was chased from a polling station during Nyacheki by-elections last week, where he had gone to witness voting. The crowd told him off saying he was not an observer.More on this: [VIDEO] Jubilee MCA shoots twice to escape ODM mob in Kisii by-electionsAlso read: ODM wins ward by-elections in Kisii, Kajiado and Turkana as Jubilee takes Tana RiverThe meeting was held to ratify the expulsion of eight governors and MPs who defected to Jubilee.&nbsp; The MPs could lose their parliamentary seats if the Registrar of Political Parties ratifies the decision of the party&#39;s disciplinary committee.
