A company associated with former Mathira MP Ephraim Maina is embroiled in a rent dispute with a property developer over a five-storey building in Nairobi.The companies in dispute allegedly entered into an agreement two years ago. Court documents show that Muchewa Ltd, entered into an agreement with Adder Company Ltd, associated with the politician, on December 21, 2014, for the former to renovate and carry out repairs on the building situated at Moktar Dada Street.David Thuo, a director of Muchewa, said the building was dilapidated and required substantial repairs.The company sought approval from the Nairobi government, which was granted on January 27, 2015. The renovations were completed in December 2015.Upon completion, Muchewa was allocated the building for a period of eight years. Rent would be deposited to Adder's account. Later, Esther Wanjira Maina, a director of Adder, allegedly directed Muchewa to be depositing the rent in her account. Thuo said it was confusing, but said they will only deposit the rent as earlier agreed.The said payment was, however, rejected and a few days later, Adder wrote to them demanding rent arrears of Sh4.17 million and sought the services of auctioneers, who descended on the premises seeking to attach properties.Enkare Hotel, one the tenants, is worried that its properties might be attached, yet they have been paying rent.The county government later said the renovations were illegal, but through lawyer Richard Mutiso, Muchewa wonders how the county can seek to revoke building plans, one year after the construction was completed.The company was forced to rush to the Business Premises Rent Tribunal, where it obtained orders stopping the alleged threat. The respondent has threatened to demolish the internal building partitions in the premises, which is comprised of shopping stalls which are let to third parties, Mutiso said. The demolition will lead to irreparable and substantial losses.On March 10 this year, when the latest approval was about to expire, officials from the county government entered the premises and purported to revoke all the ongoing works, stating the premises should revert to its former state.He said Muchewa has spent more than Sh59 million in the renovations and repairs. Sub-tenants, who are small scale business people, will be affected by the closure, he says.The case before the tribunal will be heard on December 6, while the dispute before the High Court will be heard on November 14.
