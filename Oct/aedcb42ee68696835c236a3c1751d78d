Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga has urged those linked to corruption to step aside.She said corruption must be fought from the national government down to the counties. The national government aims to ensure corruption is eradicated. Don t say Sh300 million has been misused in Kisumu and do nothing about it, Odinga said.She said the county must play its role in detering corruption. Odinga said some county officials have refused to step aside for investigations.The county assembly recently requested the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to conduct a forensic audit into misuse, abuse of office and fraud in the Ward Development Fund.The assembly, in a letter to county secretary Humphrey Nakitare, notified him that five government officials, who are signatories to the fund, will be investigated. They are expected to step aside or be suspended until investigations are completed.The officers include chairperson Cephas Kasera (Finance chief officer), fund administrator George Anyonga (Economic Planning chief officer), member Samuel Ondola (Transport chief officer), member Jacob Muga (Water chief officre) and member Lilian Ogombo (Energy chief officer). If you know you have been mentioned in any corruption case, even by the assembly, you should step aside, Odinga said in Ojola, Kisumu West, on Thursday last week.She urged residents not to keep quiet when corruption is reported and engage leaders to ensure action is taken.But Kisumu West MCA Paul Odhiambo on October 1 said he was kidnapped because of his stance against corruption. The MCA said he was kidnapped because of his open criticism of Kisumu county government.
