Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi yesterday urged people not to politicise the Tuesday dawn Mandera attack that killed 12 non-locals. He yesterday said the government should be left to investigate and devise a strategy to strengthen security.Speaking in Kikuyu town, Wamatangi condemned the attack. He said the continuous mention of terrorists could make them feel they are &ldquo;worshipped&rdquo;.&ldquo;We condemn the act. These people are heartless and we should avoid mentioning them. They are cowardly enemies of the world,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We should not politicise the issue. Terrorist attacks are reported everywhere in the world. I feel the country has a government which has approached the issue with care and has the capacity to control the attacks.&rdquo;Mandera East OCPD Ezekiel Singoe said among those killed were actors who visited the town to perform set books in secondary schools.The attack was carried out at the Bisharo Guest House.
