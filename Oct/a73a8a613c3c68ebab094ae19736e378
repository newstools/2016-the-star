First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has urged conservationists to come up with robust strategies to protect the country&rsquo;s flora and fauna. She said the government is aware of the contribution Kenya&rsquo;s natural resources make towards economic growth and thus, a raft of regulations has been put in place. She was speaking at the Intercontinental Hotel during the launch of the World Wildlife Fund&rsquo;s strategic plan.WWF-Kenya transitioned into a locally registered NGO after five years of consistently influencing conservation and sustainable development. Margaret praised the Fund, saying it has done impressive work not only in protecting endangered species, but also in areas such as fresh water, forests, climate change, energy and marine resources.&ldquo;They have expanded their work to areas that are in line with country&rsquo;s development pathway,&rdquo; she said. Margaret said real change comes overtime, accompanied by setbacks. WWF-Kenya will now join the ranks of national civil society organisations working towards conserving Kenya&rsquo;s flora and fauna. It is the second WWF office to form a national office after WWF-South Africa.
