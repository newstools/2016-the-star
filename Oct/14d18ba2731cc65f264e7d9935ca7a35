The government has set aside Sh500 million loans for students selected to join technical training institutes.Another Sh15.8 billion has been set aside to equip TTIs with state-of-the-art equipment.At the same time, the government has urged the youth to take advantage of the opportunities and acquire skills needed in the job market.Speaking during the Africa Tech Challenge student award ceremony at a Nairobi hotel, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i said there are more than 220,000 slots in TTIs that youth need to fill.Matiang i said no student should claim they could not join a TTI for lack of funds as they can get funding from the Higher Education Loans Board. We will do what we need to do to support our TTIs. Our focus is to ensure we increase the number of students enrolling in TTIs, the CS said.He said some TTIs have the capacity to manufacture machines and spare parts, some of which have already been exported to China.Deputy President William Ruto said the government is revamping TTIs so they are better-placed to equip Kenyans with technical skills.He said the government has realised the need to train more Kenyans in technical fields to utilise the country s human capital.Ruto said the government is keen on training the right number of people in the right fields to have adequate technicians and artisans to make the country industrial. Unless we have people with the relevant skills and competence, Vision 2030 can easily be Vision 3020. We have to align the training we have with the needs of the market, based on the agenda and the vision we have set out for ourselves, Ruto said.
