Deputy President William Ruto has said the government will hire 3,200 police reservists to help boost security in the Kerio Valley and end banditry that has claimed 20 lives this month.He visited the region on Thursday to assess the security situation. Ruto said each county will soon get 215 reservists. He directed security officers currently serving in the area to move to the trouble spots where bandits operate. All the officers operating in urban centres should immediately move to areas where there are problems. We ll have them on both sides of the Pokot-Marakwet border, as demanded by residents, Ruto said.He urged security officers to be decisive in dealing with criminals. More than 1,000 people have been displaced. It s pointless to have police officers in shopping centres, while criminals attack people in known valleys. Police must be stationed where criminals come from, Ruto said.The DP said many criminals are well known to security personnel and must be arrested. How come residents know cattle rustlers by name, yet no arrests are made? he asked. Ruto said the government has put in place plans to ensure development programmes are initiated, including transport infrastructure to open up the region. Ruto addressed the public in Tot World Vision grounds, Marakwet East. He was accompanied by Internal Security CS Joseph Nkaissery, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Senator John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), MPs Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East), Lati Lelelit (Samburu East), Philip Rotino (Sigor) woman reps Susan Chebet (Elgeyo Marakwet) Grace Kiptui (Baringo) and Regina Nyeris (West Pokot).Others present were governors Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu), Simon Kachapin (West Pokot) Benjamin Cheboi (Baringo), former Marakwet East MP Linah Kilimo and former IG David Kimaiyo.
