Three non-governmental organisations want the High Court to nullify Mombasa county s multibillion-shilling housing project, citing noncompliance with the law.The Legal Advice Centre, Haki Yetu St Patrick s and Transparency International Kenya said the project was initiated without public participation. The respondents ordinarily failed to supply petitioners and residents with relevant documents. This shows residents had no knowledge of the project, its benefits and negative effects, lawyer Willis Oluga said.The county intends to provide more than 30,000 housing units to residents as part of its Sh200 billion Vision 2035 mega projects.Twelve estates will be demolished to allow construction. Oluga said both parties learned of the project through the media.But Walter Amoko, representing the county government, defended the project. He said the public participated in the entire process.Amoko said those opposed to it have personal interests. Judgment will be on December 19.
