Kisumu MCAs have accused Senator Anyang Nyong o of allegedly being envious of the development projects initiated by Governor Jack Ranguma.They are Samuel Ong ow (Masogo Nyang oma), Caroline Owen (North Kisumu), Calvince Oraro (Kolwa Central), Moses Ochele (Kano Wawidhi) and Maurice Aloo (Ahero).They said Nyong o has developed tricks to derail Ranguma, because the senator lacks a development track record to present to voters.They accused Nyong o of painting the county government as corrupt and creating divisions in the assembly to block the visibility of Ranguma s success. Nyong o has been in leadership for more than 20 years, but there is not even a single development project he can point out that he has initiated, Ong ow said.They spoke in Koru, Muhoroni subcounty, on Saturday during the Devolution Torch tour. Nyong o is seeking to unseat Ranguma.
