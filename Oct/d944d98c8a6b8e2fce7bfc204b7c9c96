Kilifi chief protocol officer Mathias Kazungu on Saturday was arrested and questioned by detectives for allegedly refusing to repay a Sh300,000 loan. He was arrested at a roadblock in Gede. Politician Esther Kache said she lent Kazungu the money in 2014, but he has been avoiding her and even tried to defraud her. &ldquo;Kazungu came to me in 2014 and said he had been sent by Governor Amason Kingi to lend him Sh400,000 to host Muslim leaders at his official residence. He said the government had no money,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I told him I had no cash but I called a friend in Mombasa who asked me to pick the money the following day. Kache said she gave Kazungu Sh300,000. &ldquo;After two years of asking for the cash I was forced to pay it back and deal with Kazungu,&rdquo; she said. Kazungu, who has been on the police wanted list, refused to address journalists. Reporters were barred from photographing him at the Kilifi CID headquarters.
