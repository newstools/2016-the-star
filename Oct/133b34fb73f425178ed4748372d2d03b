It's a private company limited by shares that was incorporated on 19 June 2008,&rdquo; Githu's statement said.Other firms named beside Uhuru's family company are Dentmed Kenya Limited, Life Care Medics Ltd and Ryovac Industries Ltd.Life Care Medics is owned by millionaire Paul Wanderi Ndung&rsquo;u and Richard Ngatia.Ndung'u was among top 10 shareholders in Kenya Airways, Housing Finance and Olympia by 2010 and his shares in them were then valued at Sh576 million.The leaked internal audit indicates the scandal involved manipulating the Integrated Financial Management System, diverting funds ad making double payments.The audit says the amount lost could be of monumental proportion because the audit process is ongoing.&ldquo;The audit is experiencing setbacks in terms of facilitative environment contributing to slow delivery of audit work, which is necessary in management, decision making and fraud-risk mitigation,&rdquo; the report says.For instance, the audit says Sh515.7 million was lost through double payments under the National Aids Control Programme. It was to buy food rations for HIV patients, though no payment vouchers were availed for audit.&ldquo;Some Sh265.7 million was paid to Cooperative Bank of Kenya. The bank cannot be a supplier of food and rations and hence the real payees were not disclosed,&rdquo; the audit says.
