Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has said the Senate is not heaven, and he is not scared of facing senators who want him to respond to graft allegations levelled against his administration.He was speaking on &not;Friday during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mbale Municipal grounds.&not; e governor questioned why the Senate&rsquo;s Finance, Commerce and Budget committee wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions to have him arrested for ignoring summonses, knowing very well he was on official duty in France. &ldquo;I am a man of God and no one messes with a man of God. I will fast before going to the Senate and the truth will be known,&rdquo; Akaranga said,responding to the claims for the first time in public since he returned from France.&ldquo;Now I am around, and no one is summoning me to the Senate. I have done nothing wrong to be afraid of summonses.&rdquo;Akaranga was to respond to a petition over corruption allegations filed by 12 Vihiga MCAs through Vihiga Senator George Khaniri. The MCAs want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the DPP and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to conduct a joint forensicaudit of the county&rsquo;s finances. They also want the EACC to carry out a lifestyle audit on members of the county executive committee. Last week, Akaranga&rsquo;s lawyers engagedthe DPP and requested more time to prepare answers for questions raised by the committee.Akaranga&rsquo;s allies have claimed that the authors of the petition only wanted to re-introduce the ad hoc committee report through the Senate after it was defeated in the assembly. County commissioner Pauline Dola attended the function.
