We sent them the money we got but they returned it to us warning us that we were joking with our son s life, he said. We ve been having sleepless nights since our son was kidnapped and again we could not afford the money they were demanding, Muiruri said. I pleaded with them not to hurt or kill my child and promised to give them the money once I got it. It s then that the police tracked them to a rented house in Kisii Estate in Thika. My only worry was that they d have killed my son as they had threatened to if I failed to give them the cash, he said.The boy, however, said that the four did not hurt him and that they fed him well.Kisii residents who spoke to the star said that the house was previously occupied by a pastor who left after realizing that it was built on a road reserve.The locals said that security in the area had deteriorated and criminals were turning the area into hiding dens. Police officers must raise their game and flush out all criminals from this area. We don t want our estate to be turned into a hiding den for thugs and criminals, said resident Mary Waigwe.Thika police boss Erastus Muthamia said that police acted on intelligence reports and a tip-off from locals about suspicious people in the area.Police recovered sim cards, blankets, and food stuff from the house.Read: Gang of kidnappers held in Thika swoop
