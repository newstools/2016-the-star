Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli yesterday failed in his bid to privately prosecute six people over the development of the Sh5.3 billion Tassia II housing scheme.Atwoli wanted to file criminal proceedings against former NSSF acting managing trustee Richard Langat, trustee chairman Adan Daud, Finance secretary Mutua Kilaka and PS Ali Ismail saying it lacked merits.Chief magistrate Daniel Ogembo absolved the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, saying the two agencies were correct in closing the file against the six. Both the DPP and the EACC acted on the evidence presented against the six and after satisfying themselves there was no evidence of criminal culpability by the trustees recommended the file to be closed, he said.
