Western ANC officials yesterday urged former Jubilee steering committee co-chair Noah Wekesa to stop ranting like a ridiculous comedian and tell his patrons the region rejects JP.They said Wekesa s claim Mudavadi, as possible National Super Alliance candidate, would not defeat Jubilee shows NASA is causing political diarrhoea in the ruling party.The officials are county chairman Martin Soita (Bungoma), Julius Arunga (Kakamega) and Julius Ochiel (Vihiga).Arunga told Wekesa not to transfer his frustration to Mudavadi, after being used and dumped by Jubilee. He displays misplaced aggression, he said.Soita said Wekesa should speak about how to panel-beat the rickety Jubilee vehicle , as its sale-by-date shelf life has expired . He said the opposition doesn t need his wrinkled advice . His sentiments are part of the plot headed by Luhya Elders Forum chairman Patrick Wangamati to mud-sling and disown Mudavadi. There is no doubt this maligning by old-fashioned Luhya elders is well-coordinated and financed from the high echelons of Jubilee, Soita said.Wekesa on Wednesday said on KBC TV s breakfast show that Mudavadi cannot scare Jubilee if he becomes the opposition s compromise candidate to run against President Uhuru Kenyatta.He said a Mudavadi candidacy would cause great disharmony in Nyanza and Eastern, which would help Jubilee. He said only Cord leader Raila Odinga can give Jubilee a run for its money.Ochiel said Wekesa and Wangamati s aggressive campaign against Mudavadi is motivated by fear of NASA. That they ve been sent to besmirch Mudavadi says a lot about his capability to defeat Jubilee. These old men should save the blood money they re given for their great grand-children, instead of making unnecessary noise, he said.
