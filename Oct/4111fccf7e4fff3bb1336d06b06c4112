The government yesterday indicated it will consider two resolutions by Parliament to have Kenya withdraw from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. But State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu gave no timelines.Coming hard on the heels of South Africa and Burundi s giving notice of withdrawal from the ICC, a Kenyan exit could well be a body blow to the world s only international tribunal that handles genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, all of them atrocities that developing countries are particularly vulnerable to. Both the 10th and 11th parliaments resolved to get Kenya out of the ICC at a time when there were Kenyans on trial at The Hague, including President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. In principle, the ICC is a very good idea. But it is a bad idea for Kenya to give up the protections provided by the Court on the basis of bureaucratic discontent over a couple of cases. Kenya - and Africa - needs the ICC s protections in perpetuity.
