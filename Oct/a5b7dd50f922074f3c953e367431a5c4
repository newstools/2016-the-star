The gender commission has protested against the nomination of Justice Isaac Lenaola as judge of the Supreme Court.The commission in a statement on Tuesday termed the choice of Lenaola as unconstitutional.Winfred Lichuma, chairperson National Gender and Equality Commission (NGEC), said JSC failed to adhere to the two thirds gender rule.She said that the Judicial Service Commission discriminated against women by settling on Lenaola as replacement of retired Justice Philip Tunoi."We are dismayed that JSC despite our advise on the compliance with the two thirds gender principle failed to adhere to the Constitution by nominating a man as Judge of the Supreme Court," Lichuma said.Read: Isaac Lenaola nominated Supreme Court judge The commission said that the Supreme Court is made up of five males and two females that translates to a 71.4 per cent and 28.6 per cent respectively in favour of men."This is outrightly unconstitutional as far as the not more than two-thirds gender principle is concerned," NGEC said.The highest court team now includes Chief Justice David Maraga and Philomena Mwilu - awaiting vetting for Deputy Chief Justice.The Judges are among them Justices Mohammed Ibrahim, Jackton Boma Ojwang', Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung&rsquo;u.Isaac Lenaola is the new entrant whose name will be vetted and if approved by parliament, will be recruited as a judge of the Supreme Court.It is this composition that the gender composition is against, arguing that Tunoi should have been replaced by a woman judge. "Article 27(8), a provision in the Bill of Rights, provides that the state shall take legislative and other measures to implement the principle that not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender, popularly referred to as the two-thirds gender principle," Lichuma said.NGEC urged JSC to rescind its decision and take appropriate measures to comply with the law failure to which they will press upon the National Assembly to reject Lenaola&rsquo;s nomination.
