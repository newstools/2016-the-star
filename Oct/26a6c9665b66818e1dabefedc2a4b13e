Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli s bid to privately prosecute six former NSSF officials over the development of the controversial Tassia II housing scheme has flopped.Atwoli wanted to institute criminal proceedings against officials including former NSSF acting managing trustee Richard Langat, chairman Adan Daud, finance secretary Mutua Kilaka and Labour PS Ali Ismail.But chief magistrate Daniel Ogembo ruled on Friday that his bid lacked merit.Ogembo said Atwoli had not convinced the court that DPP Keriako Tobiko and the EACC acted unlawfully when they recommended the closure of the file for lack of evidence against the accused.He said none of the evidence tabled in court showed any form of corruption or bias on the part of the two agencies to warrant Cotu's case.Read: Ex-NSSF trustee chair loses bid to join Tassia caseAtwoli had also sought to privately prosecute Mutemi Nzetu and Gideon Kioko who are members of the tender committee that approved the project.He told the court that in exonerating the board and the management staff, the DPP failed to consider the circumstances under which the tender was awarded and approved on the same day.The NSSF has in the past been rocked by multi-million shilling scandals, which have led to questions over its ability to manage more funds.In 2014, the Ombudsman wrote to Lang'at demanding answers on the project.The move followed a complaint of corruption that Atwoli filed with the Commission on Administrative Justice.Ombudsman Otiende Omollo, wanted Lang'at to explain why he- in conjunction with board chairman Adan Mohamed- side-stepped the funds' finance, social security and investment committee in the process of approving the Sh5 billion project.Langat was to explain under what circumstances the fund decided to sink the amount into the project yet the originally approved plan was for the 5,500 ex-squatters in the said land to ay a total of Sh3.3 billion. Each of the ex-squatters, now plot-owners, were to pay Sh650,000. Subsequently and without board approval, Lang'at sent another memo proposing that plot owners pay Sh920,000. The Ombudsman further wanted Lang'at to explain why key NSSF board decisions, involving colossal amounts of workers' money, are being approved through memos to members as opposed to formal board meetings. In the original complaint, Atwoli claimed there was no quorum when the memo was circulated as members were on leave.Omollo wanted the CEO's to respond to Atwoli's claim that due to Mohamed's influence, key tenders at the fund are only awarded to construction firm China Jiangsi International Kenya.He said the complaints raised by Atwoli pointed to gross maladministration at NSSF. Atwoli asked Jubilee politicians to give the Tasia scam as much focus as they did the standard gauge railway.lso read: Ombudsman demands answers on Tasia II project
