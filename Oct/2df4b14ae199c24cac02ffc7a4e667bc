Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto s offices should be held responsible for the rampant corruption in the country.He said the executive has actively and directly undermined the leadership of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and other anti-graft agencies. Raila warned Uhuru against abdicating his authority as the President on matters concerning corruption and against interference in ongoing investigations by limiting the work of the investigating agencies.He said the government has the capacity to detect and stop corruption to deliver justice to taxpayers. The EACC accused by the President of misleading him is a moribund organisation that has become a laundromat for corruption, Raila said.
