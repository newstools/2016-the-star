A University of Nairobi legal officer demanded a Sh200,000 bribe to swear in student leaders after the May elections, so they laid a trap for him, a student said yesterday.In his testimony in court, Moses Nasibwa, a representative of the KNH campus who ran for election, told the court that when students refused to pay him, Mathews Nyandiga refused to swear them in.He also demanded another bribe from Pamela Gatobu to swear her in as the Finance Secretary.Nasibwa and Gatobu reported the matter to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.Anti-graft officials gave Gatobu Sh90,000 in marked notes and she called Omondi and asked him to meet her at Nakumatt Lifestyle in the CBD. She then gave him the money and was then arrested by EACC detectives, the witness said.The marked money and audio recordings of the bribe exchange were produced in court as evidence.Omondi is accused of soliciting and receiving the bribe. He has denied the offence and is out on Sh150,000 bail.The hearing continues on November 17.
