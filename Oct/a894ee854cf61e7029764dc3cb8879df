A Court of Appeal in Nyeri has agreed to urgently hear a case involving 17,000 acres, pitting former President Daniel Moi against the Samburu community.Judges Philip Waki, Rose Nabuye and Festus Alangakala ordered the community&rsquo;s appeal over facilitation of a site visit be heard in November, before the High Court starts its submission The community, through lawyer Lepan Suyianka, moved to the Court of Appeal after Justice Lucy Waithaka of the Land and Environmental Court ordered the case to continue without a court visit to the disputed land.The Samburus could not afford to hire four choppers for the intended site visit. Waithaka had ordered them to bear the cost of transporting the court to the land. She said on October 6 it was necessary to see the land itself using helicopters, instead of vehicles.The Samburus were also directed to pay for transport Kenya Wildlife Service, African Wildlife Foundation and Moi&rsquo;s lawyers. The cost would be enormous The three-judge bench on Tuesday said the appeal by the community raises constitutional issues that need to be addressed, despite its application having been overtaken by events. The dispute has lasted seven years.
