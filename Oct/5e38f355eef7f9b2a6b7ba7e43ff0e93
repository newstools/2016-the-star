The huge success of last weeks Orange Democratic Party (ODM) political rally at the Narok County is food for thought for those political pundits who hold the view that that ODM has lost the Maasai vote.The size of the crowd that attended the rally at Kilgoris, and the manner they responded to the speeches by Raila Odinga and other speakers is an indicator that the Mara people are still with the ODM and those who think otherwise are advised to revise their thesis.The people who braved the afternoon sun to listen to Raila went home confident that ODM has the solution to their problems. The women and men at the meeting did not hide their joy and enthusiasm as they led Raila in an orchestra type engagement throughout the occasion as he hammered on the political and social themes that touch on their lives. And whenever Raila sought to know from them what they think is the best medicine going forward, they on all counts shouted in unison that the government of the day ought to pack its bags.Throughout the ODM party leader articulated all the vices, one after the other, the current and previous regimes have inflicted on the Mara people, urging the government to publicly release the contents of the Truth and Justice Reconciliation Commission (TJRC).Indeed, it is no secret that the Mara people are angry with the Jubilee administration. And they are angry for the right reasons. First, they have complained that the encroachment of the Mara National Park has led the game to move further south; second, they are dissatisfied that the numerous investments in form of resorts, which are largely foreign owned; third, they have petitioned the non-transparent use of the Mara revenue by the county government, but the government has not addressed.The above are in addition to their long standing grievance regarding the grabbing of their land resources and the destruction of Mau Forest to make way for tea plantations, plus the irregular settlement of small holder in both the forest and Maasai communal land. The Mara people blame the settlements for the loss of forest cover, reduced rainfall, insufficient vegetation, reduction in livestock wealth and poor tourism revenues. But in spite of both the current and the immediate past governments recognizing the gravity of the situation, their desire to keep hold of the national politics has deflected the need of formulating a lasting solution. The current government has been good at observing global climatic conventions, and presenting grandiose papers on environmental conservation in international conferences but its approach at solving the Mau problem has been likened by the Mara people as that akin a small beetle trying to find its way through animal dung. They have a high grasp of the scientific language of a discipline and no epistemology of the same.These and many other reasons have persuaded the Mara people to support ODM as they are convinced that Raila is the only brave politician capable of forming a responsible government that will walk the talk. They deserve a leader who will override the interests of the powerful in order to protect the Mara ecosystem.They clearly demonstrated this in their numbers when they welcomed the political party of choice in last Narok.
