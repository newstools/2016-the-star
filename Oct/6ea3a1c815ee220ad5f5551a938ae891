Like me, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself among acquaintances where there is this one person holding court while the rest of you listen. It often happens that he will say something none of you understands. This evokes a long pause as everyone looks thoughtful, trying, but not succeeding, to figure out what was just said. It&rsquo;s on rare cases that someone dares ask, &lsquo;What was that you said? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo; We are like that, Kenyans; we don&rsquo;t like to ask questions, more so questions we have a feeling everyone around us knows the answers to. We think it makes us look stupid, and nooo Kenyan wants to look stupid.It&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re wired. Our education system has programmed us to believe that not having answers makes you less, and that unless you&rsquo;re a reporter or solving a crime, the only place for questions is in school.It is this aversion to asking questions, this keenness to appear knowledgeable about everything, that makes us so easy to trick, and the cause of a lot of the problems we find ourselves with today. Questions aren&rsquo;t asked to the powers that be. Well sometimes they are but the answers we get are so convoluted. I&rsquo;m thinking Eurobond here, we end up exactly where we started when we asked the question; still in the dark but now pretending we know all about Eurobond kwa kinaganaga.The trick to these kinds of complex answers is that it&rsquo;s a play on our fear of looking stupid. Our rulers know that only a very brave Kenyan will admit, &lsquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;Kenyans, let&rsquo;s not be afraid to look stupid. When you ask you seek to understand, and if you don&rsquo;t, ask again. And if the answer is still not clear the second time round well then I suggest you put it the way Denzel did in Philadelphia and say, &lsquo;Explain it to me like I&rsquo;m a six-year-old.&rsquo; As David Cooperrider, co-founder of of the theory of Appreciative Inquiry, said: &lsquo;We live in the world our questions create.&rsquo;
