Youths supporting different politicians clashed during the launch of the Young Jubilee Association Murang&rsquo;a chapter on Saturday. Members of the association found a group of boda boda operators from Murang&rsquo;a town setting up a barricade at Mukuyu market to bar their motorcade from entering the town, prompting fierce confrontations. Riot police used teargas canisters to disperse the groups. The motorcade, which was headed for a rally in Ihura Stadium, then made its way into Murang&rsquo;a town. The stadium was closed. Boda boda operators who gathered outside the stadium accused members of the association of being funded by a local politician to sow seeds of discord among residents.
