The Mombasa Republican Council on Tuesday criticised two MPs for taking advantage of the poor Mijikenda community for political gain. The council said Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga and Nyali s Hezron Awiti should ensure implementation of the law legalising traditional mnazi brew, instead of leading street protests.Last week they led demonstrations against harassment of mnazi vendors .Deputy spokesman Richard Lewa said Mwinga is a lawyer and should have organised a workshop to educate the vendors on on regulations. Any law passed has to have regulations. It is the duty of the MPs to ensure the mnazi vendors are properly educated on what they are allowed to do and what they are not, he said.
