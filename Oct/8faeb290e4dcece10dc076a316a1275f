Nominated MP Oburu Oginga has hit at Jubilee leaders for castigating their Cord counterparts over plans for the formation of a super alliance ahead of the 2017 general election.Cord, which is led by Raila Odinga, is in discussions with several parties on forming a political outfit under which they intend to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta from power.Oburu said those branding his brother a "devil" for opposing the government are not honest with themselves."When Raila was campaigning for Kibaki he was called a strong leader, but when his turn reached he was branded a devil," he said on SaturdayOburu welcomed Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi's plans to join forces with politicians angling for change of leadership.He told residents of Dadra village in Ugenya sub-county, Siaya, that the super coalition was the only way to defeat Uhuru.The legislator said the move will save Raila and Mudavadi from being duped into joining "fake" alliances, and being called "devils"."I remember last time Uhuru and his cohort cheated Mudavadi that they were going to make him a presidential candidate," he said. "The next day they claimed Mudavadi was a mysterious devil that had appeared from nowhere."Read: We will form 'super alliance' with Cord to defeat Jubilee - MudavadiAlso read: Uhuru allies anxious over Super Alliance The MP said it was high time Raila and Mudavadi formed a formidable force and that they were on the right track."We advise them to solidify the coalition by embracing other like-minded leaders," he said.Oburu said Deputy President William Ruto will suffer the fate befell Mudavadi and Raila in the past."I have heard he (Ruto) is being positioned by Jubilee as a presidential candidate in 2022.
