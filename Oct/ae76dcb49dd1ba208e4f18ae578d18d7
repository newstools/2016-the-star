He also does the same to Baringo senator Gideon Moi and other leaders who do not agree with him on issues," he said.He reminded the deputy president that politics is about competition of issues not attacks on personal character.Also read: I am not Ruto's wife to be forced into Jubilee Party - Gideon Moi The governor said that his strong stand on devolution was the reason for his sour relationship with Jubilee."They seem not to understand the difference between devolution and Isaac Rutto. This is not a URP or Jubilee affair. It is a matter of all Kenyans. I want to advise this government support devolution," he said.Rutto said that it is sad that the Jubilee government has been frustrating the growth of devolution by ensuring that the counties do not get more cash."I want to make clear to Kenyans that when we are demanding for more monies to the counties, the move should not be misconstrued to mean that we are undermining or want to wrestle power from the Jubilee," he said.The governor said counties have rolled out tangible development projects which the national government had not done in 50 years.The county boss said that said for the first time since independence, people in rural areas had access to healthcare as a result of the same.The former council of governors chairman says that he decided to form Chama cha Mashinani (CCM) because Jubilee has scuttled devolution.He said that the new outfit will fight for equitable distribution of resources and urged Kenyans to support the party."I will defend my seat on CCM because Jubilee leaders have told me that they have their preferred candidate," Rutto said.
