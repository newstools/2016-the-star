Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has told the NCIC to stop the &ldquo;witch-hunt and targeting Rift Valley leaders&rdquo; over their demands to hire a qualified local as Moi University VC .He on Monday said they will not be intimidated by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to stop demanding fairness and appointment based on merit at the university.Laban Ayiro took over last month as acting vice chancellor, but some area politicians rejected his appointment, saying he was not qualified.Mandago said leaders from the region had been demanding that Isaac Kosgey be appointed to head the university, because &ldquo;he was the best during recruitment interviews&rdquo;.Speaking in Kesses, he said NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo should stop &ldquo;playing politics&rdquo;. &ldquo;We want to tell Kaparo not to misuse the NCIC. He should lead it like an old man to unite Kenyans and not target some communities or individuals,&rdquo; Mandago said. He and others caused a national uproar and were accused of tribalism when they stormed Moi University on September 20 and demanded appointment of a Kalenjin, not Ayiro.He and others deny the charges, saying they only want the best qualified candidate.Mandago accused Kaparo of using the media to condemn the North Rift leaders who were summoned by the NCIC to record statements.&ldquo;Kaparo should have first listened and understood what happened before condemning us in the media. It&rsquo;s unfair to condemn us then force us to record statements,&rdquo; Mandago said.He said they only went to Moi University to demand merit in appointment of the VC. &ldquo;We will not be intimidated,&rdquo; the governor said.
