The National Gender and Equality Commission yesterday lost a bid to stop the confirmation of Justice Isaac Lenaola as a Supreme Court judge.Lenaola was nominated by the Judicial Service Commission to replace retired Justice Philip Tunoi after beating 21 other applicants.The gender commission filed an application under a certificate of urgency, seeking to temporarily stop him from being sworn in, saying the JSC violated the constitution. Judge Joseph Onguto, however, declined to issue orders.He instead certified the case as urgent and directed the commission to serve the AG, JSC and Lenaola with the suit papers immediately.The judge said he was not going to issue orders because of a decision issued by the court in a case filed by Fida Kenya verses JSC. I am not inclined to grant any interim conservatory orders. And I hereby decline to do so, Onguto said.He directed the parties return on November 2 for a hearing. After deliberations, JSC recommended Lenaola for the appointment as judge of the Supreme Court and has submitted his name to the President, JSC chairperson Margaret Kobia said in a statement on Tuesday.The gender commission said his nomination goes against the two- thirds gender rule. It wants a woman appointed.NGEC chairperson Winfred Lichuma, in the affidavit said the two-thirds rule will not be adhered to because the composition translates to only 28.6 per cent of the judges being women.She said the commission wrote an advisory note to the JSC through registrar Anne Amadi. The JSC, despite our advice on the compliance with the not more than two-thirds gender principle as far as the composition of the Supreme Court bench is concerned, failed to adhere to the Constitution and has contravened the law by nominating a man, Lichuma said.She said Article 27 ( 8 ) in the Bill of Rights, provides that the state will take legislative measures to implement the two-thirds principle of the members of elective or appointive agencies.Lenaola s nomination will be discussed by the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.It will then be presented in Parliament and then to the President for appointment.
