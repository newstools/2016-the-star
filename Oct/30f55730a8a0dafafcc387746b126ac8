The man who claimed to be the son of the late William Ntimama is seeking court orders to exhume his body.George Kariuki, 60, said in amended court documents on Tuesday that he wants Ntimama's body exhumed so he can extract tissue samples that will help him prove their relationship.He wants the samples used to ascertain paternity through DNA testing.Kariuki insists that he is a biological son of the late Maasai community leader and that he is entitled to taking his name and inheriting his vast estate.The High Court declined to stop Ntimama's burial on September 14 for the man to carry out DNA testing.Justice Joseph Onguto said Njoroge should have done the tests before the former Heritage minster died.The judge also said he was not convinced the orders he sought were urgent enough to warrant the court's interference with the burial that was held on September 14.The case will be mentioned on December 20Read: Man who claims to be late Ntimama's son wants burial stopped, recognised as sonAlso read: No DNA paternity test on body of Ntimama, court tells son
