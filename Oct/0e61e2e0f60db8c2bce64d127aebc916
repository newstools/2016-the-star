The current drought situation in various parts of the nation has the potential to hinder the achievement of development goals, the National Drought Management Authority has said.Reports indicate that 1.3 million Kenyans face starvation as the ravaging drought has resulted in food and water shortages.NDMA chairperson Agnes Ndetei has called for proper mitigation measures to be taken.She spoke during an NDMA workshop at the Lamu Kenya Ports Authority offices on Wednesday.Ndetei urged the national and county governments to work together in finding a lasting solution to end the perennial drought crises threatening food and water security.The current drought situation has affected all the 23 counties within the arid and semi-arid land zones and three coastal counties, she said. &ldquo;Here at the Coast, Lamu, Kilifi and Tana River counties are bearing the brunt of a drought crisis. We can practically say that the situation is testing the country&rsquo;s preparedness and resolve in handling a cyclic problem,&rdquo; Ndetei said.She acknowledged efforts made by the state and well-wishers in providing relief food drought-stricken areas, but added there is need for a better lasting solution to the food and water security problems especially in ASAL areas.&ldquo;Our main mandate and objective as NDMA is to have a Kenya where the drought effects are not felt by its citizens come 2022. This can only be achieved if the national and county governments and other agencies work closely and collaborate in implementing mitigation measures that are sustainable,&rdquo; Ndetei said.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy said the county is prepared and has taken measures to mitigate the effects of the drought.The county had set aside Sh30 million to ensure victims of drought in Lamu get adequate supplies of water until the dry spell is over, he said.Lamu Kenya Wildlife Service senior warden Jacob Orale said the drought situation has greatly contributed to increased human-wildlife conflicts. &ldquo;Many water catchment areas and pans, especially those in conservancy areas, are drying up. This has led to most wild animals migrating to residential areas and even urban centres in search of water, thus leading to conflict,&rdquo; he said.
