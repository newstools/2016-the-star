The Green Belt Foundation founded by Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai has applauded the Nairobi government for recognising the environmentalist. Executive director Aisha Karanja said Maathai&rsquo;s passion and tireless efforts to conserve the environment have finally been recognised.During Mashujaa Day celebrations in the Pumwani Sports Ground on Thursday, Governor Evans Kidero renamed Forest Road after Maathai in recognition of her tireless campaigns for a safe environment.&ldquo;We wanted Limuru Road renamed after her [as it is] bigger and passes near Karura Forest, which the late Maathai fought for. But we are still happy, at least the county has recognised her,&rdquo; Karanja said. Kidero renamed Cross Road in the CBD after veteran multi-partyism crusader Charles Rubia. The road between City Hall Annex and Cardinal Otunga Plaza to Uhuru Highway will now be known as Cardinal Otunga Road.In July last year, the assembly passed a motion by Karura MCA Kamau Thuo to rename Limuru Road after Maathai, following a petition by the GBM. She founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977 to campaign against deforestation and champion women&rsquo;s rights. Yesterday Thuo said he will petition the House to compel the executive to rename Limuru Road after her. &ldquo;We have been shortchanged because we requested Limuru Road to be renamed after the heroine. I even sponsored a motion to that effect and it was approved by the assembly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maathai was not only an icon in Kenya but worldwide. That is why we need Limuru Road named after her because it is used by many people, including ambassadors.&rdquo; Last year, Transport executive Mohamed Abdullahi ruled out renaming the road after Maathai, saying the county does not have the powers to change its name as it is under the national government.
