Some 18 pick-ups bought for the Nairobi Inspectorate department in 2014 for Sh83 million to carry petty offenders are lying idle in a garage.The department rejected them, saying they were not suitable for the work they were meant to do.In a memo to the Procurement department, head of inspectorate Francis Munyambu said the vehicles should be fully covered double cabin pick-ups.He also demanded that the windows of the vehicles be reinforced with metal grills, the rear be separated from the driver s cabin, their doors only be opened from outside and the vehicles be of the same colour.The assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, which has been investigating the matter, said the committee inspected the vehicles and found out they did not meet the specifications of the user department. The Procurement department did not invite the user department to verify the specifications. That is what brought all these problems," committee chairman Jaffer Kassam said.He said the vehicles do not have metal grills on the windows and their doors open from the inside.
