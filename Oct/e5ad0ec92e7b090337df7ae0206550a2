A warrant of arrest has been issued against Defence PS Kirimi Kaberia for allegedly failing to pay Sh5 million to a former senior army officer who was sacked unlawfully nine years ago. Justice George Odunga in a ruling directed police to arrest Kaberia and bring him to court on October 24 to explain why action should not be taken against him for disobeying the directive.The warrant was issued on October 10 after Silvanus Odiaga informed the court that the PS, who is also the accounting officer in the Defence ministry, has refused to comply with the orders issued in July 2014 to pay him for unlawful termination.In addition, the judge directed the warrant to be returned with endorsement to confirm compliance .Odiaga sued the Attorney General following his sacking on 2007.He told court he had been commissioned as a lieutenant 11 in the Kenya Army in 1981 leading to his appointment as a commanding officer.In July 2006, he was given a special assignment to cover a function in Nakuru though he was stationed at Kahawa Garrison.The following year he was charged with eight counts related to disobedience to standing orders of the Armed Forces Act. He was accused of incurring expenses in respect of tinned pineapples, cooking fat, bags of sugar, rice and Blue Band.Although he was acquitted of some of the allegations, a committee that investigated him found him guilty of four allegations relating to flouting procurement regulations.He appealed before the committee, but his plea was not considered. Eventually he was retired on pension in September of the same year.Aggrieved by the decision, he sued the state, arguing that his termination was in breach of his terms and condition of service and was actuated by malice.He said given his rank of lieutenant colonel, his commission could only be terminated by the President.In July 2014, Justice Linet Ndolo of the Labour court ruled that his superiors mishandled his case and she set aside the criminal proceedings.The award is yet to be settled, prompting him to go back to court seeking to compel the ministry to pay him.
