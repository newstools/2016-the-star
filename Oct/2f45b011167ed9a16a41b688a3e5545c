The national and the Lamu governments have partnered with the Kenya Red Cross Society to distribute water to drought-stricken areas. More than 30,000 residents and 200,000 livestock are facing starvation. On Tuesday, Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said government vehicles will be used to distribute water. He said his office is also distributing 800 bags of relief food.The worst-hit areas are Witu, Pandanguo, Moa, Hindi, Bargoni and all villages occupied by the Boni people in Lamu East. The biggest problem is food and water and that s where we are putting our efforts, he said.Meanwhile, residents want the county government to help them market their livestock, before the animals die of starvation.
