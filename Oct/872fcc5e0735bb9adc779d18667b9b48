Jubilee and Cord are lobbying furiously for and against Governor Evans Kidero&rsquo;s impeachment as the city boss is expected before the MCAs today.It is not known if he will appear in person or send his lawyers.Kidero&rsquo;s camp is reaching out to Jubilee MCAs to reject the motion.Jubilee MCAs have brought on board two renegade Cord MCAs and have been meeting secretly with key party officials, planning how to lure more Cord MCAs to their side.Kidero is accused of lack of leadership, incompetence, failure to implement the Ward Development Fund and responsibility for an &ldquo;unmanageable&rdquo; Sh42 billion debt.Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang&rsquo;wara, sponsor of the impeachment motion, and his South C counterpart Diana Kapeen, have moved to the ruling coalition.Minority whip Hashim Kamau said, &ldquo;Yes, we have been meeting, even this afternoon [yesterday] we are meeting in Embakasi. Kidero must go home,. Watch this space.&rdquo;Nyang&rsquo;wara told the Star many Cord MCAs fear coming out openly to support the motion for fear of victimisation, but have pledged to vote for the motion in a secret ballot.Sources yesterday said a senior officer in the governor&rsquo;s office has been meeting Jubilee MCAs to convince them to vote against the motion. The officer is said to be behind the move by three Jubilee MCAs &mdash; Charles Thuo (Dandora III), George Maina (Umoja I) and Peter Wahinya (Pangani) &mdash; to swear an affidavit to withdraw their signatures from the petition last week.The governor arrived in the country on Sunday from a three-day visit to the UK. County attorney Gad Awuonda declined to say if the governor will appear in person.&ldquo;That is our strategy, why do you want to know? The governor has options. But we are prepared,&rdquo; Awuonda told the Star on the phone.
