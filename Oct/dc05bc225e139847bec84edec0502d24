Former Chief Justice Abdul Majid Cockar died aged 93 at his home in Nairobi on Monday morning. The cause of his death has not been revealed but he will be buried at Kariokor Muslim Cemetery today. Cockar served between 1994 and 1997, a period during which he tackled corruption and laxity at some judiciary stations. He was the second Asian Chief Justice to be appointed after Chunilal Madan. Cockar served in the judiciary for 37 years before retiring to a law firm he co-owned with his brother. The firm he operated with his brother, Industrial Court judge Saeed Cockar, is known as Cockar & Cockar Advocates. Majid launched his autobiography 'Doings, Non-doings and Mis-doings' in 2012.  Chief Justice David Maraga lays a wreath on the grave of former CJ Abdul Majid Cockar who died on Monday, October 31, 2016. /COURTESY Newly appointed Chief Justice David Maraga eulogised Cockar as a beacon of motivation for many on the bar and the bench. Maraga noted he served as High Court and Court of Appel judge before becoming CJ. "Former colleagues in the judiciary and the legal profession agree that Cockar left an indelible footprint in Kenya as a former public servant, lawyer and family man," he said. Maraga advised Kenyans to read Cockar's autobiography, saying "[it] is an authoritative and interesting personal account of much more than his life and the judiciary". In it, the late judge gives rare glimpses into the dynamics of the administration of justice in post-Independence Kenya.
