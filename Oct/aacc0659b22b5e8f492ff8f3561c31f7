Kisumu assembly speaker Ann Adul has reprimanded committees for failing to table reports. She said the MCAs are paid allowance and sponsored for trips yet they have nothing to show for it. We have lists of reports dated back to last year that should be brought to this House and discussed but this has not been done, Adul said on Wednesday afternoon.She was furious that the House was being adjourned for lack of business. Adul said what the MCAs are doing is tantamount to robbing the taxpayer. There are families that go hungry yet they pay taxes, while the MCAs who are supposed to be working for them are not serious and pocket allowance for every sitting, she said.
