Jelagat overcomes disappointment to triumph in NairobiJelagat Seurey put away the disappointment of last year's Standard Chartered marathon to win the women's Standard Chartered Nairobi International Marthaton this time round.A year ago Seurey pulled out of the event after suffering an ankle injury but lady luck was around to smiled on her this year as she cruised to victory in 2:34:18. Recho Kosgei came second in 2:35:11 followed by Rose Maru third in 2:37:22 .The leading pack broke away from the rest of the field at the 15 kilometre mark paced by Kelen Waithera, Lucy Livoga and Eunice Kioko but they soon faded with Maru and Kosgei charging to the front at the halfway point with Seurey joining them. The three athletes were joined by Shelmith Muriuki and Emily Samoei at the 25 kilometre mark with the warm conditions ideal for runners.Seurey stole a match on her rivals with seven kilometres to go and she never looked back as she paced herself to victory.
