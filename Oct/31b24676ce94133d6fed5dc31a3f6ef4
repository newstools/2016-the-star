It's extremely depressing especially for the sick," @kibuchimzito tweeted.@waithash said "[It is] sad that the President's family members may heve been involved in the Sh5 billion scandal that have [sic] shaken the health ministry with leaders pushing for the resignation of health PS Nicholas Muraguri." @Mwolooto queried: "Did Uhuru know that he was clearing the jails to create space for his close family members?"Uhuru's sister Nyokabi Muthama and cousin Kathleen Kihanya are directors of a company that pocketed Sh41 million in questionable payouts.They own Sundales International Limited, registered on September 12, 2013 five months after Uhuru's election.Expert comment: This Health scam is the President s scamThe Star's independent investigations show the company has been awarded government contracts running into hundreds of millions.Between September 2014 and February this year, for instance, Sundales won at least five separate tenders from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority worth Sh270 million.On Friday, Cord leader Raila Odinga challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take personal responsibility for the latest multiple-billion-shilling scandal in the government.Read: Raila asks Uhuru to take responsibility for Sh5 billion allegations#UhurutoCorruptionTrainThe Health scandal is just one of the latest corruption scandals to emerge under the Jubilee administration after a leaked internal audit report claims the funds were siphoned out through the manipulation of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS), diversion of funds and double payment for goods.The report says the scandal, which is five times the infamous Sh791 million National Youth Service scandal, also involved payment of millions of shillings to phony companies.Using the hashtag #UhurutoCorruptionTrain, Kenyans highlighted this as among some of the mega corruption scandals that have rocked the Jubilee administration since it came into power in 2013.@Kanyi_1 said: The way kids die in KNH everyday then watching 5b scam kills me twice.

Its our way of life. #UhurutoCorruptionTrainBut @Official_Muli seemed to question Kenyans outrage at the ongoing scams wondering why they were doing nothing about it.His tweet read: Kenyans keep on complaining about corruption and yet they can't do nothing even a simple demonstration.. hahaha #UhurutoCorruptionTrainOthers like @JumaJunior3 appeared to absolve President Uhuru Kenyatta from blame over the runaway corruption, tweeting: Uhuru is not corrupt, he is only presiding over a rotten govnt full of aggressive opportunists. #UhurutoCorruptionTrainMore missing billionsApart from the NYS scandal, and currently the Afya House scandal, christened Mafia House , several other corruption scandals have been unraveled in the past, a majority of which involved billions of shillings.They include the passport tendering Anglo Leasing scandal that saw the country lose in excess of Sh3 billion in payments to phantom companies for the supply of a system to print new high-technology passports.Other fictitious companies involved in the scam that was exposed in 2004 were given money to supply naval ships and forensic laboratories.Seven ex-government officials, including a sitting senator, have been charged in connection with the multimillion-dollar corruption scam.Chris Obure, who served as finance minister under former President Daniel arap Moi and is now the senator for Kisii, is the most senior official to be charged over the scandal.Former Finance Minister David Mwiraria is another high profile official to have been charged over the scandal.Uhuru said his government had no option other than to honour the payments agreed under the Anglo Leasing contract even though the scam allegedly began during Moi s reign and continued under his successor former President Mwai Kibaki, who came to power in 2002.More on this: State sanctioned 18 Anglo Leasing projects following advice from AG Another high magnitude corruption saga to rock Uhuru's administration is the Eurobond scandal where some Sh140 billion could allegedly not be accounted for.Eurobond was conceived by government as an avenue for external borrowing to facilitate the financing of major projects and generate financial capital to meet the deficit on government s budget.The money was said to have been baked over to the government but its expenditure could not be traced.Questions were also raised over the span of time between the issue and the duration it took for its realisation, pointing to a possibility that some individuals were unfairly benefiting from the proceeds of the deposited amount by way of interest.Also read: 'No evidence' of Sh250 billion Eurobond theft claim - TobikoThe Chickengate scandal is also top in Kenya s hall of shame after investigations by UK s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) alleged that about Sh50 million was paid out as bribes to IEBC officials.The bribes were allegedly paid out by officials of Smith and Ouzman as kickbacks referred to as 'chicken' to enable the firm win a ballot paper printing tender.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission cleared former electoral chairman Isaack Hassan from corruption allegations in the scandal.But the commission recommended criminal charges against four people, including former IEBC chief executive James Oswago, agent Trevy Oyombra, Hamida Ali Kibwana and Kenneth Karani.A list circulating on Twitter highlights lists the following as recent corruption scandals that have allegedly taken place under the Jubilee administration:1.
