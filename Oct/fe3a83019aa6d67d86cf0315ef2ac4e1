ODM members who defected to the Jubilee Party will face the party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee on Friday.Committee chairman Fred Athuok told the Star they will hear each of the 13 leaders, including two governors, independently.&ldquo;We have summoned them for Friday at the headquarters in the morning... They will come in one-by-one. It&rsquo;s a straight forward issue &ndash; either you have defected or not,&rdquo; the lawyer said yesterday.ODM has threatened to kick out the defectors in what might trigger unprecedented by-elections with only 10 months to the 2017 general election.Athuok said all the 13 leaders responded, despite initially saying they will ignore the &ldquo;show cause&rdquo; warning.They include Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani, his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya and Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga.Others are Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Mathare MP Steven Kariuki, Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro (Kilifi), Isaac Mwaura (nominated) and James Rege (Karachuonyo).Athuok said the seven-day window to Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba and Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima has not elapsed.&ldquo;The two will be summoned at a later date,&rdquo; he said.However, some of the targeted MPs have accused ODM of dishonesty in the purge, saying Raila and the Orange Party have also been receiving defectors.
