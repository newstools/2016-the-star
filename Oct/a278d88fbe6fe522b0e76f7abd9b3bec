Nairobi doctors have abandoned negotiations with the county in the ongoing strike over promotions and pay arrears.Nairobi doctors went on strike last month, demanding Sh34 million salary arrears for six months for 53 newly posted doctors. Early this month, they resumed their strike, demanding promotions and remittance of pending statutory and non-statutory deductions.Health executive Bernard Muia on Saturday said union officials, led by branch secretary general Kaugiria Thuranira, stormed out of his office on Friday. He termed the action &ldquo;unceremonious and disrespectful&rdquo;, saying the county has met all their demands.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve held meetings with union representatives, including Thuranira. They have no goodwill to end the stalemate,&rdquo; Muia said. &ldquo;The county has paid the Sh34 million salary arrears.&rdquo;He said last week they promoted all the 52 pending common cadre doctors. Muia said a board will next week review the promotion applications of 46 consultants who do not qualify for automatic upgrade.He said the union seems hell-bent on grandstanding and holding the county to ransom. He warned doctors against skipping work on Monday, saying they will be sacked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stretched my limits. We now have to take action,&rdquo; he said.The CEC said a few of the promotion letters had &ldquo;some errors&rdquo;, which will be corrected. He accused the doctors of utter disrespect after some of them scrawled large corrections on those letters before sending them back.&ldquo;Some letters were returned to the chief officer with the grievances scribbled on them. That&rsquo;s absolutely disrespectful,&rdquo; he said. Thuranira and Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union secretary general Ouma Oluga were unavailable for comment.
