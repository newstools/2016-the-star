Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi on Friday clashed with Nema board members when they visited a dumpsite near her residence. She complained the dumpsite is a health hazard as it is located near a residential area, Asian Quarters. She said the dumpsite is a haven of criminals who attack locals and rape women. Murugi criticised board director Patrick Ngatia and David Ong&rsquo;are, director in charge of compliance and enforcement, for doing too little despite residents&rsquo; protests over the years. &ldquo;We have a right to a clean environment. The local residents are even ready to burn these trucks pouring refuse here. Don&rsquo;t cheat us that you have alternative land since the county government has not allocated money in the budget for alternative land,&rdquo; Murugi said. Ong&rsquo;are said the dumpsite will be moved in six months. Ngatia said Nema and the county government have a plan to relocate the dumpsite. He said by April next year trucks will be banned from dumping refuse there.
