Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o has apologised to residents for making Jack Ranguma the governor as he has failed to develop the county.Leaders wanted former PS David Nalo to run for governor on March 4, 2013, but he died six months before the elections on September 13, 2012, he said. Nalo died at the wrong time when I had already started my campaigns for the Senate position and we decided to look for a candidate from Kano and that is when we landed on Ranguma, Nyong o said.The senator said they made the mistake of not looking into the governor s background, where he had previously worked and why he left. We did not ask Muhoroni people what he did at the factory or question the Kenya Revenue Authority why he left, he said in Kisumu on Friday.The only development since Ranguma took over in 2013 is the Kachok dumpsite popularly known as Got Ranguma, the senator said.Nyong o said it is not too late for Kisumu and residents should now elect him governor after witnessing how badly Ranguma has performed.The governor has not developed the county and provided efficient services. For the last four years, the county government has been receiving not less than Sh6 billion every year, excluding conditional grants, Equalisation Funds and money from the national government, the senator said.Currently, the approved Sh280 million for the Ward Development Fund cannot be accounted and projects it was to fund, such as tarmac roads and improve hospitals, have not been done in the last year, Nyong o said. Many good things are happening in counties where governors and assemblies are serious about devolution, he said.Nyong o also faulted the Kisumu government for not involving citizens in public participation on county matters. He said he wants to ensure Kisumu develops and residents receive services.
