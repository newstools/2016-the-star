Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has launched his reelection campaign. On Monday, he met residents of Kitale town to promote the &lsquo;Khaemba tena&rsquo; campaign. Khaemba urged voters to give him a second term so he can serve for 10 years.&ldquo;My development record speaks for itself and I don&rsquo;t know why you should look for another person. I have done perfectly the work you gave me to do,&rdquo; he said.Khaemba said his rivals have many shortcomings, but he does not want to meddle in their affairs because they do not add value to the lives of residents.He said some politicians criticise him, yet they have done little for residents.&ldquo;I have done a lot and I&rsquo;m still doing a lot. That&rsquo;s why I should be reelected to serve a second term,&rdquo; Khaemba said.&ldquo;I want to tell the so-called opponents my development record is the basis upon which I will be reelected by 9am [on Voting Day].&rdquo;He urged his rivals to stop mudslinging, as his development projects are there for all to see. Those running against Khaemba include high school principal Cosmus Nabungolo, Dianah Lukosi, Festus Mukoya, Joshua Sang, Kakai Bisau and Noah Wekesa.Khaemba said he is an experienced person, having served as Livestock PS and a senior official at the African Development Bank before he was elected governor. He said nobody can outdo him in development.&ldquo;Which other governor does Trans Nzoia need when I am so experienced? I have brought water to people&rsquo;s doorsteps and new equipment to ensure all our roads are passable,&rdquo; Khaemba said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting up a county referral hospital. I have constructed ECDE classrooms and hired caretakers, these are just among the many projects I have done.&rdquo;
