No one has called him a thief. And his temper when asked questions on the audit queries show that he is hiding something. Murang a residents are demanding answers from him and therefore he should understand that fighting the Senate won t leave him off the hook because we will see to it that he responds to all queries raised in the report, Wahome said.The MP spoke at Kirunguru primary school in Kandara on Friday while commissioning the newly refurbished classrooms by the Constituency Development Fund. She also presented a sh 300,000 cheque to Kirunguru secondary school for completion of the school s science laboratory.
