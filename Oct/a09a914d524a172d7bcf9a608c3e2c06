Kandara MP Alice Muthoni Wahome has accused Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia of disrespecting residents by failing to answer audit queries.The MP said the governor was violating Murang&rsquo;a residents&rsquo; rights by failing to answer questions when he appeared before the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee last week and failed to respond to audit queries emanating from an audit report for the 2013/2014 financial year.Wahome said that hostility portrayed by Wairia during the Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o led committee indicated that he was escaping from accountability and transparency on public funds expenditure by his government.&ldquo;No one has called him a thief. And his temper when asked questions on the audit queries show that he is hiding something. Murang&rsquo;a residents are demanding answers from him and therefore he should understand that fighting the Senate won&rsquo;t leave him off the hook because we will see to it that he responds to all queries raised in the report,&rdquo; Wahome said.The MP spoke at Kirunguru primary school in Kandara on Friday while commissioning the newly refurbished classrooms by the Constituency Development Fund. She also presented a sh 300,000 cheque to Kirunguru secondary school for completion of the school&rsquo;s science laboratory.
