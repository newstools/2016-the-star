Kinangop youths have denied allegations they were hired to heckle Nyandarua Deputy Governor Mwangi Kirika during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kipipiri Stadium.Kirika accused Governor Waithaka Mwangi of hiring the youths to heckle him last Thursday. The youths said they heckled Kirika voluntarily, because he causes division whenever he talks. Heckler Zack Mungai yesterday said, If he thinks we were paid, he should also look for us and pay us too. Since his election in 2013, Kirika has fought the governor and other leaders, hurting their ability to implement projects. He opposes everything. Another heckler, Stephen Kamau, said the people of Kinangop elected Kirika as their MP for two terms but he did not help us .He said Kirika only built a water tank at his home. He said the tank would provide water to Engineer residents, but it has not benefitted the community, Kamau said.Kirika said Mwangi is the heckler commander . If that is the kind of politics the governor wants us to engage in, we will, he said. Mwangi did not comment on heckling-for-pay, but urged residents to behave well. Young people, I urge you to respect eachother, he said yesterday.
