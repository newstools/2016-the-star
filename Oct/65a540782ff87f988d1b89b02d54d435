Some 35 Bungoma MCAs have endorsed Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati for governor. The MCAs are from both Jubilee and Cord. Led by minority leader Ali Machani, they said the former Kanduyi MP is best-placed to replace Governor Kenneth Lusaka. Khanga&rsquo;ti lost to Lusaka in the March 4, 2013, general election.&lsquo;&rsquo;Khang&rsquo;ati initiated many projects in Kanduyi and we feel that he can use the same experience to initiate development projects in this county,&rsquo;&rsquo; Machani said. He spoke after they met Khang&rsquo;ati in Bungoma town on Tuesday evening. &ldquo;I really feel sorry for you because you are carrying blame, which is not for you but for Lusaka. It is good you have identified some leadership qualities in me. I will not let you down,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said. Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Wycliffe Wangamati has also expressed interest in the seat.
