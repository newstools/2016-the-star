The Mbeere Council of Elders has confirmed Senator Lenny Kivuti&rsquo;s endorsement for Embu governor after it sought the consent of the community&rsquo;s 39 clans at a holy shrine.This comes after the elders endorsed the senator on September 16 at his Kanyuambora home in Mbeere North subcounty. The decision sparked controversy, as some elders claimed to have been coerced to do so.On Saturday, more than 3,000 clan representatives from the Mbeere community legitimised the council&rsquo;s decision at the Kwa Rumbia Holy Shrine in Mbeere North subcounty, where, traditionally, all decisions about the community are made.They said the elders&rsquo; decision is final. Led by council of elders&rsquo; chairman Eston Nyagah, the clans pledged their support for Kivuti and gave him their blessings, saying he is &ldquo;the most suitable leader from the community to lead the county&rdquo;.The clans urged their Embu counterparts to support the senator. They want the Embu community to endorse one of its members for the position of senator so the county can ensure &ldquo;equitable distribution of power&rdquo;.Embu Council of Elders&rsquo; (Kiama Kia Nyangi Ndiiriri) chairman Richard Mbogo, who led 84 elders at the shrine in observing the decision of the clans, said he will mobilise more than 1,500 elders to endorse Kivuti. He said Kivuti should rest assured they will endorse him, as they &ldquo;had already decided&rdquo;.The elders said the memorandum of understanding agreed on before the 2013 general election provided that if one community produces the governor, the other produces the senator. They said this maintains peaceful co-existence.Speakers praised Kivuti for his &ldquo;good development record, straight character, wisdom and humility&rdquo;. They said Kivuti initiated many development projects and if elected, Embu will greatly prosper. Kivuti said he was humbled by the endorsement and assured the elders he will emerge victorious.
