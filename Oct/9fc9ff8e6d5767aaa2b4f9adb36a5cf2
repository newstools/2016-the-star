The national Kabaddi team captain David Shilisia has attributed their sterling performance during the just concluded World Cup to sheer discipline and hard work.The team participated in their first ever Kabaddi World Cup and pulled major upsets against super powers including United States, Japan and Poland. They beat Poland 54-48, Japan 48-27 and thrashed United States 74-19 to finish third in their Pool B behind eventual winners Iran and runners up Thailand. We went into the competition knowing that we were underdogs but at the same time, we needed to prove that the sport in Kenya is growing and we were ready to go places. The players believed in themselves and remained focused on the task at hand, said Shilisia. Defender James Obilo was feted the best stopper while the team won the Emerging Team of 2016 award.
