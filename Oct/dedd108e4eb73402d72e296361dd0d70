Activist Boniface Mwangi has continued his offensive against Deputy President William Ruto and is now demanding for the DP s tax returns.Ruto has sued Mwangi for defamation over a tweet published on September 30 that links him to slain businessman Jacob Juma s death. Mwangi has denied defaming the DP.In a letter to the Kenya Revenue Authority, Mwangi, through his lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, wants Ruto s wealth declarations returns for the period he has been DP. We require you to provide us with information as soon as possible but no later than Thursday November 1st 2016 to enable to fully exercise his constitutional right to a fair hearing, Gitobu wrote.Mwangi is also demanding a list of Ruto s companies and peoples listed as co-directors and the dividends paid to the Deputy President in each firm.It is not clear why Mwangi is seeking the information.However, there have been questions about Ruto s source of wealth, particularly the millions he contributes in funds drives.But the self-described hustler has always insisted that he is philanthropic.
