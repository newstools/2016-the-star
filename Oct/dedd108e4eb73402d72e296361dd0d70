Activist Boniface Mwangi has continued his offensive against Deputy President William Ruto and is now demanding for the DP&rsquo;s tax returns.Ruto has sued Mwangi for defamation over a tweet published on September 30 that links him to slain businessman Jacob Juma&rsquo;s death. Mwangi has denied defaming the DP.In a letter to the Kenya Revenue Authority, Mwangi, through his lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, wants Ruto&rsquo;s wealth declarations returns for the period he has been DP.&ldquo;We require you to provide us with information as soon as possible but no later than Thursday November 1st 2016 to enable to fully exercise his constitutional right to a fair hearing,&rdquo; Gitobu wrote.Mwangi is also demanding a list of Ruto&rsquo;s companies and peoples listed as co-directors and the dividends paid to the Deputy President in each firm.It is not clear why Mwangi is seeking the information.However, there have been questions about Ruto&rsquo;s source of wealth, particularly the millions he contributes in funds drives.But the self-described hustler has always insisted that he is philanthropic.
