Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has lashed out at the national government for not responding adequately to the drought ravaging the county.Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Garissa Primary School yesterday, he said the biggest budget remains with the national government, so it should act swiftly when such calamities occur. Jama said this would save human beings and livestock. It is worth noting that drought is not a devolved function and I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our plea to the national government to make immediate interventions and complement our efforts as a county, he said. Jama said the county government is doing everything within its capacity to mitigate the effects of the drought.
