Six journalists face trial in France for invasion of privacy over topless photos of Britain's Duchess of Cambridge published in 2012.The snaps of Kate Middleton, wife of Prince William, were taken with a long lens and showed her topless on a balcony of a private residence in the south of France during a holiday with her husband.The photos appeared in French celebrity magazine Closer in September 2012, sparking fury from the British royal family and reviving a debate on press intrusion into the private lives of celebrities.Closer's chief editor, the head of the Mondadori press group which owns the magazine, two photographers of a Parisian agency and a photographer and a senior figure at regional daily newspaper La Provence will appear in court over the publication of the intimate photos, magistrates have decided.The pictures in question first appeared on the front page of the regional daily in southern France on September 7, 2012, before Closer gave them a wider audience a week later.The directors of La Provence denied that one of their photographers took the offending pictures.The topless images were later published elsewhere in Europe, notably in Chi magazine, also owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mondadori media group, as well as in Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.The royal couple had lodged a complaint over the pictures.Their lawyers obtained a civil injunction and sought criminal charges in Paris in a bid to curb the spread of the pictures.The pictures revived debate about invasions of privacy by the press and brought echoes of the hounding by paparazzi endured by William's mother, Princess Diana, who died in Paris in 1997 after the car she was in crashed while fleeing scooter-riding photographers.The French trial for the photos will be held in 2017.The pictures were taken at Chateau D Autet, a luxury holiday chateau in Provence which is which is owned by Viscount Linley, the Queen s nephew.He is said to have promised William and Kate a sun-kissed break in absolute privacy before they set off on a tour of Asia. It is not the first time Kate has turned to the courts where she has felt her privacy has been invaded.In 2009 when still William's girlfriend she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall and the image was syndicated by a picture agency to foreign media outlets.The Duchess later won 5,000 in damages and an apology from Rex Features for invasion of privacy.
