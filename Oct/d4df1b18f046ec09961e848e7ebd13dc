I m excited and nervous as well ahead of thev Guru Nanak Rally. The last time I sat in a Subaru was in 2014 and my last rally and the only one to date was back in 2011. Arusha terrain is similar to Kajiado, that s what I m told. The Subaru Impreza GVB 15 is in good form. It s a new car acquired this year so few teething issues. I m looking forward to having some fantastic fun and most importantly guide Raj well. Next weekend I m back with Paps for the final round of the Kenyan Raid ....hopefully lady luck smiles at us and we have a good run, he said.The rally, which will begin on Sunday will cover about 150kms of competitive mileage around Arusha.
