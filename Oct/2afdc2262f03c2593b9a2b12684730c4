Kenyans have won nine of the 21 CNN Multichoice African Journalist of the Year awards, including this year, raising the question: Are Kenyans the undisputed best journalists in the continent?Asha Mwilu ( 1 ) and Rashid Idi ( 5 ) of KTN once again made the country proud when they bagged the 2016 overall award for their investigative documentary about the security intrigues at the Kenya-Somali border in Mandera county.Terror Crossing was found by the judges to be &ldquo;a high impact story told in the wake of Kenya&rsquo;s plans to build a wall on her border with Somalia&rdquo;.The story was aired by KTN in its investigative programme &ldquo;The Lead&rdquo;. It was recognised at a gala event held on Saturday night in South Africa.Joseph Mathenge ( 4 ) won the award in 2014 for his photos that captured the terror attack at Westgate Mall the previous year.&nbsp;Kenya also bagged the award in 2012 with a story by Tom Mboya ( 6 ) and Evanson Nyaga of &ldquo;The African Tribe in India&rdquo;, a TV documentary about Black people in the heart of India who trace their heritage to Africa.The Star&rsquo;s Fatuma Noor won the award in 2011 with her story about al Shabaab&rsquo;s network in Kenya and Somalia. Other winners are John Allan Namu ( 3 ), ( 2009 ), Angelo Kinyua ( 2005 ), Peter Murimi ( 2004 ), Wanja Njuguna who tied with a South African ( 2000 ) and Ken Opala ( 1996 ).South Africans have won the award five times, Nigerians three times, Zimbabweans twice while Burkina Faso, Uganda and Ghana have each won once.So what is the winning formula?Nancy Booker, a veteran journalism teacher with Multimedia University said: &ldquo;They submit stories that go beyond everyday reporting to reflect the challenges that people in society go through every day.&rdquo;&ldquo;Real stories touching on real issues affected real people. Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t get too many of those because they are time consuming and expensive for most media houses to sustain,&rdquo; she said.Rufus Chege believes Kenyan journalists know what judges look for, enter stories that affect ordinary rural folk, take angles that are universally resonating and are lucky.&ldquo;Media houses can sustain this. I believe most journalists want it easy, covering &lsquo;who said what&rsquo; stories. A few go the extra mile, establish contacts with development agencies and nose out for &lsquo;pain points&rsquo;, get it right and win awards,&rdquo; Chege said.
