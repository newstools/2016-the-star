Mandera Governor Ali Roba has been urged to stop confusing the Garre community by saying he will run in next year s election.Hassan Osman, who has been nominated by the Garre Council of Elders to contest for senator, said it is unfortunate to see Roba, a product of negotiated democracy, criticising the same process and elders who brought him to power.He said the same elders Roba is trying to defy are the ones who convinced his opponent Abdikadir Abdullahi to step aside. Roba has dismissed the elders decision to bar him from contesting. Osman said some individuals are misleading and mis-advising him.He said they will not succeed in dividing the community. As a community, we are in jubilee to stay. This is because the Jubilee government has done a lot for our county and people after being marginalised for decades, Osman said.
