Mandera county commissioner Fredrick Shisia has attributed the rampant terror attacks in the area to failure by locals to provide information on al Shabaab.Shisia told the Star that the intelligence network of the terror group resides in Mandera and only the executers come from Somalia."Even in the most recent attack in Bishaare lodge, those who plotted and identified the areas of attack reside within the community," he said."The executers came from Somalia and we are already probing some suspects," Shisia said. He said that some of the residents had the 'important information of an imminent attack' but concealed the same.Read: Twelve dead, six rescued in Mandera terror attack "These practices paralyses efforts by the security personnel to arrest and convict the members of the militia," Shisia said."Al Shabaab uses intimidation and propaganda thus residents have fear giving any information even when they get knowledge of their whereabouts," he said.The county commissioner also noted that he had received leads alleging traders operating within the Mandera were paying 'operational fee' to the militia.He warned the traders against such practices, which are also under probe, adding that the situation facilitates the economic survival of the group.Some residents who spoke to the Star, confirmed the possibility of the group living within them but noted that they would not dare give information to the government."Al-Shabaab are well organised and have spies everywhere within Mandera. If you dare open your mouth on their whereabouts they come after you and your family. Most people prefer to remain silent," one of the residents said.The residents also pointed out the possibility of some security personnel cooperating with the al Shabaab by taking bribes.The matter was also raised by Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow after the recent attack.More on this: Police corruption steering al Shabaab ambushes, Mandera leaders saySince 2012, Mandera has experienced 14 major attacks that left more than 100 dead, 90 per cent of the victims being non-locals.In 2014, the county witnessed the highest number of deaths from terror linked attacks accumulating to 50 per cent of the total deaths that have occurred since 2012.Mandera North and Mandera East constituencies are the main areas affected with frequent attacks.The two constituencies are directly situated along the Kenya Somalia border.
