The NLC yesterday was told the former City Council of Nairobi could have allocated non-existing land to Alfajiri Self-Help Group in 2007.The National Land Commission heard the land was sold to Sauti Sacco by Continental Developers in 1992 and they were issued with the title deed in 1994. The purpose of buying the 83 acres was to subdivide it among 650 members, Sauti Sacco chairman David Ndwigah told NLC.It also emerged that Sauti Sacco is being dragged into an unnecessary turmoil with the group over a land that does not exist. Alfajiri group is claiming 15 acres, saying the City Council had allegedly allocated to it in 2007 to build a hospital for HIV positive patients.Ndwigah said the more than 80 acres were later divided into two in 2007, after Greenspan bought 50 acres. The remaining 30 acres were then divided into 648 plots among members, he told the commission.NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri said the commission has received many fake documents. We have received thousands of fake documents, Swazuri said yesterday.He spoke in Nairobi during the hearing to determine the legality of some of the contested parcels of lands.During the hearing, it emerged Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero had written confirming the documents Alfajiri group has, were fraudulently acquired. He said the land in question did not belong to the City Council at the time and there is no possibility it could have been allocated to them by the same council. The NLC sought to understand how minutes from the Town Planning Committee of the defunct council approved the 30 acres for Alfajiri. David Oyata, representing the Alfajiri Self-Help Group, found himself in a tight spot after he failed to explain how his clients got land.Swazuri ordered the Alfajiri group to present documents, which they say they possess before the commission.
