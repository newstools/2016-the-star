LSK has pledged to support Chief Justice David Maraga as he works to restore public trust and confidence int he Judiciary.Chairman Isaac Okero has said the new CJ deserves the full support of the bar as he commences duty, and he shall receive this from members of the Law Society."Justice Maraga takes the helm of a judiciary, which has in the last few days become the convenient whipping boy in the fight against corruption. This is unfair and will only undermine public trust and confidence," Okero said in a statement on Thursday.But the LSK chair said he is confident that Maraga will quickly restore the function and dignity of the apex court."The truth is that cases in court are as good as are presented and prosecuted," he said.He said court cases tend to be marred by "shoddy investigations and poorly-conducted prosecutions" rather than the corruption of judicial officers.He also asked Maraga to use his experience in private practice and as a judge of the superior court, since he has the benefit of both perspectives.Justice Maraga was sworn in as the country's second CJ under the current constitution on Wednesday.He succeeded retired Chief Justice Willy Mutunga who left office in July to avert a constitutional crisis.The appellate judge was vetted by a key House committee on the backdrop of three petitions against his appointment.LSK's statement comes shortly after claims that the Judiciary has failed to resolve corruption cases.During the Governance and Accountability Summit held at State House Nairobi, Attorney General Githu Muigai termed the Judiciary &ldquo;the weakest link&rdquo; in the justice chain.More on this: 'Cry baby' Uhuru faces KOT wrath after corruption frustration[VIDEO] Frustrated Uhuru scolds state officials on rampant corruption.
