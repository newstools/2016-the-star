President Uhuru Kenyatta should arrest and prosecute &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; officials in his government if he is really committed to ending graft, Cord leader Raila Odinga has said.He said all sectors, including health, education, water, finance and agriculture are &ldquo;rotten&rdquo;.Raila said Jubilee keeps making excuses, saying it is investigating corruption &ldquo;yet it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;.&ldquo;There is no way the government can be carrying out investigations on issues that have already been established and clearly produced in the Auditor General&rsquo;s report,&rdquo; he said. Raila made the remarks during the burial of Mama Joyce Adhiambo, the mother of veteran journalist David Ohito in Dadra village, Ugenya constituency, on Saturday.MPs David Ochieng&rsquo; (Ugenya), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Siaya Senator James Orengo were present.Raila Odinga&rsquo;s wife Ida and police spokesman Charles Owino were also present.Wandayi urged the President to tell Kenyans &ldquo;what he knows about the Sh5.3 billion scandal in the Ministry of Health&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is not just graft, but impunity, which is tantamount to economic sabotage,&rdquo; he said. Wandayi urged Uhuru to resign. The MPs said Uhuru is planting seeds for the removal of Jubilee from power next year.Orengo said Uhuru should not blame anybody for his woes.&ldquo;The time for him to go is now because he cannot preside over a government of economic sabotage,&rdquo; he said. Raila said investigations are a cover-up. He said the probe is only meant to hoodwink Kenyans into believing the government is serious in the war against corruption. &ldquo;If anything is going to come out of those investigations, it is a cover-up. All they are looking for is evidence so they can hide it,&rdquo; Raila said.
