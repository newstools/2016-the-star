President Uhuru Kenyatta should arrest and prosecute corrupt officials in his government if he is really committed to ending graft, Cord leader Raila Odinga has said.He said all sectors, including health, education, water, finance and agriculture are rotten .Raila said Jubilee keeps making excuses, saying it is investigating corruption yet it isn t . There is no way the government can be carrying out investigations on issues that have already been established and clearly produced in the Auditor General s report, he said. Raila made the remarks during the burial of Mama Joyce Adhiambo, the mother of veteran journalist David Ohito in Dadra village, Ugenya constituency, on Saturday.MPs David Ochieng (Ugenya), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), nominated MP Oburu Oginga and Siaya Senator James Orengo were present.Raila Odinga s wife Ida and police spokesman Charles Owino were also present.Wandayi urged the President to tell Kenyans what he knows about the Sh5.3 billion scandal in the Ministry of Health . This is not just graft, but impunity, which is tantamount to economic sabotage, he said. Wandayi urged Uhuru to resign. The MPs said Uhuru is planting seeds for the removal of Jubilee from power next year.Orengo said Uhuru should not blame anybody for his woes. The time for him to go is now because he cannot preside over a government of economic sabotage, he said. Raila said investigations are a cover-up. He said the probe is only meant to hoodwink Kenyans into believing the government is serious in the war against corruption. If anything is going to come out of those investigations, it is a cover-up. All they are looking for is evidence so they can hide it, Raila said.
