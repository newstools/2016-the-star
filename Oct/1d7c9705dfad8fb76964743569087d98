The Kisumu county assembly Welfare Committee has been asked to investigate concerns by the MCAs that the water they drink is unsafe. Manyatta B MCA Nerea Okombo raised the concern in Wednesday s session. She said genuine bottled water is not filled to the brim, saying this is suspicious.This was echoed by deputy majority leader James Omolo. Muhoroni-Koru MCA Willis Ogonyo said he has been unwell and he suspects it might have to do with the water they drink at the assembly. Kisumu North ward representative Caroline Owen said they might be consuming impurities.But West Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi said they have been drinking the water for a long time and asked why the concerns are being raised now. A sample of the water will be taken for tests. The MCAs said the water does not meet Kebs quality and want the assembly to stop buying it until it is proven safe.
