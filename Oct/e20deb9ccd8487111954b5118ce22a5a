A fresh supremacy war is looming between legislators and senators.The Senate is against MPs from 14 marginalised counties overseeing the multibillion-shilling equalisation fund.Senators have promised to oppose an amendment law to the Constitution by MPs. They are against allowing the Sh6 billion equalisation fund channeled directly to constituencies in marginalised areas. A written communication presented at the Senate on Tuesday asks the House to shoot down The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) 2013 from National Assembly amending Article 204 (3) to effect the disbursement proposal. The Senate as the protector of the interests of the counties should oppose this amendment, the communication reads. The result would be channeling monies that should have gone to the counties as conditional grants to constituencies and managed under the national government CDF. Senators want the equalisation fund under the national government disbursed either directly or indirectly through conditional grants to counties in marginalised communities.Pokot South MP David Pkosing said the senators plot is driven by malice. He said opposing the Bill will hurt residents. Senators want to start supremacy wars. They are not reading the same script as us. The net effect of them refusing does not change the idea that the money remains in national government, he said.Pkosing said the dispute emanates from loopholes in the Constitution on implementation law of the fund.
