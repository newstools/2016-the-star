Former Migori mayor Peter Masara yesterday supported Governor Okoth Obado s decision to build a county ODM office. Obado s political handlers have been trying to have ODM leader Raila Odinga to officially open the building. Masara, who wants to run for Suna West MP, said Obado s move to build the office shows his support for the party. I encourage Obado to move ahead and make the donation of the parcel and the building to the party, he said. Masara said politicians are only opposing the move because they think Obado will use it as his secretariat and if Raila opens it, it will be seen as a direct endorsement.
