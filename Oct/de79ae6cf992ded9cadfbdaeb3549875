Online mobile sports betting firm, Betway has launched another promotion to reward its loyal customers. The firm is set to reward them with 30,000 different prizes in 30 days ten times more than the previous promotion that saw 3,000 prizes won in 30 days.This will be the largest promotion Betway has run in Kenya to-date and the firm is confident the promotion will not only attract new interest from football fans, but will also cement their position in the fast-growing market. The promotion will run until midnight on the November 18 and will see 1000 prizes given away daily to lucky individuals. Every day one of our 1,000 daily winners will be selected to go into our Grand Prize draw at the end of the promotion, where they stand the chance to win an Isuzu double-cabin, said Betway country manager Wanja Gikonyo. To participate in the promotion, customers need to bet with only Sh100 to gain one entry into the daily prize draw. Customers who bet higher amounts will earn more entries and again a higher chance of winning a daily prize. However, the best chances to win will go to those who bet the minimum of Sh100 every day for the duration of the promotion.
