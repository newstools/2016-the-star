Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has banned the use of politicians&rsquo; portraits in school materials.From school buses, test papers to equipment such as geometrical sets, politicians have been generous, dishing out donations bearing their names and portraits. This is gaining momentum as candidates write their final examinations. The donations also bear party colours.Matiang&rsquo;i said the donations have to stop because they are not only partisan, but also intrude into school programmes.In an advertisement, he directed education directors to ensure &ldquo;no school property, assets and examination materials bear individual portraits, political party colours or any partisan political messages&rdquo;.Last week, the CS disbanded the Siaya county education board for allowing illegal mock exams. Matiang&rsquo;i also interdicted subcounty directors of education for flouting government regulations by allowing standard eight candidates to sit mock exams.The examination papers bore the portrait of Governor Cornel Rasanga. The exam had been sponsored by the county government for Sh1.7 million.Matiang&rsquo;i said the ministry acknowledges the need for partnerships with various stakeholders, including the Constituency Development Fund, Ward Development Fund and county governments, in the development of infrastructure and support for co-curricular activities.&ldquo;However, we remain mindful of the fact that the provision of free and compulsory education is a mandate of the Ministry of Education and must be done within the provisions of the Constitution, law and policies that guide the sector,&rdquo; reads the statement.
