Labour Party of Kenya boss Ababu Namwamba has accused politicians of hypocrisy in addressing corruption. He said some politicians have been hammering the national government but turn a blind eye to the rampant corruption in the county governments.Some Cord rebels have accused Raila Odinga of not speaking out strongly about corruption in counties led by Cord governors. There is inconsistency and dishonesty. We must question the national government and confront it on corruption and incompetence.But we must also apply the same standards to the county governments, he said. We must be consistent and shame accordingly. What is bad in Nairobi cannot be good in other counties. Namwamba was speaking during a church service at the Glory Worship Centre in Bangla, Jomvu constituency, yesterday.
