Labour Party of Kenya boss Ababu Namwamba has accused politicians of hypocrisy in addressing corruption. He said some politicians have been hammering the national government but turn a blind eye to the rampant corruption in the county governments.Some Cord rebels have accused Raila Odinga of not speaking out strongly about corruption in counties led by Cord governors. &ldquo;There is inconsistency and dishonesty. We must question the national government and confront it on corruption and incompetence.But we must also apply the same standards to the county governments,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must be consistent and shame accordingly. What is bad in Nairobi cannot be good in other counties.&rdquo; Namwamba was speaking during a church service at the Glory Worship Centre in Bangla, Jomvu constituency, yesterday.
