Priscah Jepleting Cherono and Julius Chepkwony Rotich produced dominating performances to claim a Kenyan double at the 31st edition of the Venice Marathon, an IAAF Silver Label Road Race, on Sunday.Cherono improved her personal best to 2:27:41 to beat Ester Macharia Wanjiru by more than seven minutes while Rotich successfully defended his title in 2:10:22, beating Ethiopian Chala Adugna Bekele by 3:29 to become the third repeat winner in Venice after Salvatore Bettiol in 1986 and 1987 and Jonathan Kipkorir Kosgei in 2006 and 2007.In the women&rsquo;s race, Jepleting and Ester Macharia took the early lead, going through 5km in 17:27 and 10 in 35:18. But then Cherono began to pull away, building a 16-second lead by 15km (52:12) and extending it to 1:32 at the midway point (1:13:41).Cherono maintained a 2:27 tempo across the famous Ponte della Libert&agrave; Bridge, passing 35km in 2:02:03, more than five minutes ahead of Macharia.Cherono continued towards the finish unpressed to make a substantial improvement on her previous personal best of 2:29:08 set in Enschede last April. She scored her second marathon win on Italian soil after finishing first in Florence last November in 2:31:34. &ldquo;I am happy that I improved my personal best from last year,&rdquo; Cherono said. &ldquo;At 40km, I saw I could improve my personal best. I hope to return here next year and improve my record.&rdquo;Wanjiru was a distant second in 2:35:15.The men&rsquo;s race set off at a fast pace. A seven-men group formed by Chepkwony, Francis Ngare, Ishmael Kalalee, Titus Kwemoi Masai, Bekele, and brothers Richard and Bernard Bett breezed through the opening 5km in 15:14 and the next five at nearly the same pace, passing the 10-km mark in 30:26. My midway, the lead pack was whittled down to four, with Ngare, Rotich, Kalale and Masai going through in 1:04:19, still well inside a sub-2:09 pace.Rotich and Masai then broke away from Ngare to build a 22-second gap in San Giuliano&rsquo;s Park, reaching 30 kilometres in 1:31:36. Soon after Bekele closed the gap to catch Ngare and move into third.Rotich forced the pace as he ran across the Ponte della Libert&agrave;, reaching 35km in 1:46.57 and increasing his lead over Bekele and Masai to more than two minutes.Rotich began to tire at 40km when he had to face the 14 bridges that cover the course&rsquo;s final 2km. The faster early pace took its toll but Rotich still managed to pull off a comfortable win.&ldquo;I knew that I could repeat my win from last year,&rdquo; said Rotich, who nabbed his second marathon win of the year after a victory in Geneva in May. &ldquo;I received strong support along the course and I enjoyed this race.&rdquo; The father of two is already eager to take a third victory next year. &ldquo;I want to return to Venice next year with my kids,&rdquo; he said. Bekele was a distant second in 2:13:51. Further back, Masai was third clocking 2:15:34.
