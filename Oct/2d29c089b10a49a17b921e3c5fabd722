Tanzanian President John Magufuli was stuck in traffic on Monday as roads had reportedly not been cleared for his arrival. Witnesses told the Star that he was held up in the snarl-up on Uhuru Highway, on his maiden visit to Kenya following his election in October 2015. Magufuli had earlier chosen to walk from Intercontinental Hotel where he was staying to the nearby Jomo Kenyatta mausoleum. He was caught in the traffic on his way from the mausoleum to State House. Among activities slated for Magufuli's two-day visit are talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta and a joint news conference at State House. The two leaders will discuss matters including Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed's candidature for the position of Africa Union Commission chairperson.
