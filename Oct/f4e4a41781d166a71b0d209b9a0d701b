State House has welcomed the endorsement of Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed s candidacy for African Union Commission chairperson by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the endorsement is an indication of the faith African countries have in Mohamed s leadership. We believe their judgement is sound, he said.Esipisu said Comesa members made it clear Mohamed s long experience in diplomacy, proven experience working with multilateral organisations, and successful stint as Kenya s Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs all made her the best candidate to advance Africa s Agenda 2063. Deputy President William Ruto lobbied several Comesa leaders in pushing this agenda during the recent Heads of State Summit in Madagascar. That engagement followed intervention by the President himself, who met eight leaders on the sidelines of the AU Summit on Maritime Security in Togo to discuss support for Mohamed, Esipisu said.
