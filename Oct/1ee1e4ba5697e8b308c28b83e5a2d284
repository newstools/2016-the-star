The government had released Sh7.7 million to cushion 26,000 Kitui residents against the biting drought.National Drought Management Authority county coordinator Francis Koma on Tuesday said Kitui South is the worst-hit followed by Kitui East, Mwingi Central, North and West, and Kitui Rural and Central.&ldquo;These people are in dire need of food to save them from imminent starvation. Livestock in these areas are also starving,&rdquo; he said.Koma said the NDMA headquarters has approved the Sh7,767,200 intervention from the government. He said the drought mitigation programme starts this month.Koma told the press in his Kitui office the relief aid will mainly go to water, livestock and health sectors. He said out of the Sh7.7 million, the livestock department will take the lions share due to the procurement of vaccines.Koma said four schools in Kanziku and Ikutha wards will get plastic water tanks.&ldquo;The rains were very little leading to a great decline in food and livestock production," he said.
