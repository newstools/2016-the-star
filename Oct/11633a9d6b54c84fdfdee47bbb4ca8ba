Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has urged Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wairia to keep off other leaders' affairs and stop ordering them around.He said Wairia should stop being "dictatorial" and stick to his mandate as governor.&ldquo;In Murang'a we do not want a prefect to order us around because we all are elected by the people and must stick to serving them the best way we can,&rdquo; Kamau said.He was referring to the governor's request that Murang'a MPs give their input on the Northern Collector Tunnel.&ldquo;The governor should not try to portray himself as the perfect one because we as leaders must take into consideration all aspects of the tunnel before we address the public. That is what shows maturity and soberness in politics,&rdquo; Kamau said.The governor aspirant urged area leaders not to mix politics and the water issue so they get a lasting solution for Murang'a residents.The tunnel will collect water from Makomboki for consumption in Nairobi.&ldquo;I want MPs Jamleck Kamau, Irungu Kang'ata, Tyrus Ngahu and Peter Kamande to state their ground on the issue so we can know what they think of the Jubilee government,&rdquo; Wairia said.Kamau said leaders will push to have enough water for the residents, ensure that those whose farms and land is taken are fully compensated.He said there should be no negative environmental impacts in search of water.&ldquo;Everyone knows what happened when Ndakaini dam was built to supply water to Nairobi. I hope we learnt from that mistake and we can now focus on ensuring Murang'a will benefit from the water tunnel,&rdquo; Kamau said.
