Former Jubilee coordinating committee co-chair Noah Wekesa yesterday said Jubilee will not be shaken by the much-touted National Super Alliance of all major opposition parties.Wekesa also said the alliance will lose should it name Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi as its compromise presidential candidate.He spoke during a breakfast show on KBC radio.&ldquo;Settling on Mudavadi will not scare Jubilee in Western. Such a move will cause a lot of disharmony in Nyanza and Ukambani,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The regions will feel Raila Odinga or Kalonzo Musyoka &mdash; whom they perceive the right opposition candidates &mdash; have been left out.&rdquo;Wekesa said only Cord leader Raila Odinga can give Jubilee a run for its money as the join opposition&rsquo;s presidential flagbearer. Mudavadi&rsquo;s ANC is championing formation of a super alliance bringing on board Cord and other like-minded parties to remove Jubilee from power.Mudavadi said the envisaged alliance will be broad-based, including labour movements, religious leaders and the business community. Cord has welcomed it.While drumming up support for the outfit, Mudavadi said he is the best man to fly the opposition flag at the 2017 polls. But Wekesa said it&rsquo;s wrong to think Jubilee will be sent packing if Mudavadi is the candidate.The ANC chief is expected in Western this weekend when he will sell his NASA agenda in Busia and Kakamega counties. The political ground in Western recently has become hostile to Jubilee-leaning leaders.On Saturday, said Mudvadi will be in Teso to launch the Oku Kaunya Foundation named after a former administration police boss. On Sunday, he will be in Navakholo, Kakamega, where he is to receive former UDF officials into his party.
