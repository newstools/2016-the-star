NAIROBI Governor Evans Kidero is to be commended for renaming three roads in the city after national heroes on the occasion of Mashujaa Day yesterday (see P23).Forest Road will be named after environmentalist Wangari Maathai, Kenya s first female professor and Nobel laureate. She fought epic advocacy battles, including against President Moi and Kanu, to conserve Karura Forest and Uhuru Park.Cross Road will be named after the multiparty crusader Charles Rubia, the first African mayor of Nairobi, who, decades later, led calls for multi-party democracy alongside Kenneth Matiba.The road between City Hall Annex and Cardinal Otunga Plaza running up to Uhuru Highway will become Cardinal Otunga Road. He was the first Kenyan African to be consecrated a bishop and then a cardinal of the Catholic Church.Kidero s example is worth emulating elsewhere in Kenya. In a country with such a massive youth bulge as Kenya s, it is important to know who our heroes and heroines are and what kind of role models they are.
