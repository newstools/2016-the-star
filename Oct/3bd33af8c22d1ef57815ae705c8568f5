Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi has asked Kandara MP Alice Wahome to withdraw her petition against the nomination of Philomena Mwilu as Deputy Chief Justice.Mwilu was vetted by Parliament yesterday. In a memorandum on October 19, Wahome said Mwilu should not be appointed because she received a Sh3 million bribe to influence the outcome of an election petition filed in 2008. The Kandara MP has asked the anti-graft commission to investigate the bribery claim.Speaking during a meet-the-people tour in Yatta on Sunday, Mwangangi said Wahome&rsquo;s allegations are politically motivated.
