Deputy President William Ruto has challenged the Cord affiliate parties to merge and form a single party so they can face Jubilee at &ldquo;an equal level&rdquo;.In a blunt attack on the opposition, he said glaring cracks driven by personal interests stand in the way of a united opposition ahead of next year&rsquo;s polls.&ldquo;It is not easy to unite. It is no mean task. We know it is difficult,&rdquo; Ruto said during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos yesterday.Responding to remarks by Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka, who said Cord has opted not to merge, the DP told the opposition Kenyans will get real choices based on ideas if it formed one party.&ldquo;We will then compete at the same level. As things are today, we are at different levels,&rdquo; he said.When invited to speak, Kalonzo said, &ldquo;In Cord, we did not swallow one one another like Jubilee did. We have independent parties like Wiper, ODM and Ford Kenya.&rdquo;Bungoma Senator and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula attended the celebrations but was not given an opportunity to speak. Raila travelled to London for a political summit.Ruto said having many parties is a recipe for tribalism and divisive politics. He said the Jubilee Party will build a bridge of brotherhood and togetherness.&ldquo;We want to lay a foundation for our politics so we can bring Kenyans together, irrespective of their religion, region or tribe,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said the Jubilee administration will continue to fund the county governments as new centres of opportunity to spur economic growth at the grassroots.He said since devolution was ushered in, about Sh1 trillion has been sent to the counties, making the system a new frontier for development.
