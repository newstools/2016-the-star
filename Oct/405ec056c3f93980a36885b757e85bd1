I would like to urge the private sector to partner with the county government to solve the water issues by assisting us in technical training to our staff and provision of technical equipment s which most counties lack .Davis and Shirtliff CEO David Gatende said the decision to open the Narok branch was not solely a business decision but propelled by the increasing need to respond to needs by communities in the country.
