A farmhand fatally stabbed his wife and two children in Mowlem village in Makuyu, Murang a county, before hanging himself.Thirty-year-old Bernard Kiiru killed 22-year-old wife Teresiah Wambui on Monday night, before turning on his four-year-old and one-year-old children. He then stabbed himself once before hanging himself, police said.His employer Mwangi Wachira said he learnt of the deaths at 6.30am when he went to wake Kiiru. He said he wanted Kiiru to open the gate to a borehole at 5am, but there was no response from his house.Wachira said he employed Kiiru, who moved to the village two weeks ago from Laikipia, as a casual labourer in his farm. He said he waited for Kiiru to wake up and when he failed to respond, he returned to his house and alerted his neighbours. Wachira said they broke into the house, where they found Kiiru s wife and two sons lying in a pool of blood, while his body dangled from the rafters. For the two weeks he worked for me, he was a good and hard-working employee. I don t understand what could have prompted this, Wachira said.He said the family did not seem to have disputes and Kiiru did not show any signs of stress. Neighbours said they were shocked by the incident, as they thought the couple was happily married.County police boss Naomi Ichami said Kiiru used a panga to murder his wife and children. She said they are investigating the motive. The bodies were taken to Thika District Hospital s mortuary for a postmortem.
