Kitengela residents and a Kajiado governor hopeful have urged Governor David Nkedianye to fix the water problem in the area.The residents say all water pans in the area have dried up and they are forced to buy the commodity from vendors for as high as Sh100 per 20-litre jerican."We receive water only once a week, the day it comes, people fill this place, we fight for it," said resident Jenipher Mueni.Mueni said vendors have taken advantage of the situation, selling the commodity at high prices to desperate residents."We have two water points, one is at Savanna and another at Kitengela Grounds, and they are both owned by private companies who charge us the way they want," she told the Star while queuing for the scarce commodity.Kevin Mugunde, a water vendor, said they are making a kill from the scarcity."I buy this water at Sh15 per 20-litre jerican and I sell at Sh50 and if the situation worsens, then I sell at Sh100," Mugunde said.Jubilee governor hopeful George King ori accused the county government of failing to address the problem despite several pleas by the residents."We want the county government to address this problem. There are more than 350,000 people in this area and livestock," King ori told residents at the Kitengela Grounds on Saturday.The county officials were unavailable for comment.King ori is one of the five people who expressed interest in the county s top seat on a Jubilee ticket.Former Interior CS Joseph Ole Lenku,Kenya Meat Commission chairman Taryia ole Kores, Daniel Nina and Simon Meeli are the other hopefuls seeking to unseat ODM s Nkedianye.King ori denied that he is seeking a deputy governor position and accused competitors of peddling lies'.
