Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli wants the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission stopped from interfering with hiring of NSSF chief executive.He castigated the anti-graft agency for summoning the yet-to-be hired NSSF trustee saying the EACC has no mandate to question such persons unless the NSSF board requests for such a probe.Atwoli said the EACC is only out to influence the process of hiring the new CEO so as to gain access to worker's money for 2017 polls."The EACC has written a letter to NSSF where they are saying that we must send names of the appointees for them to chose for us a CEO. The NSSF Act does not say the power to appoint lies with the EACC," he said in Nakuru on Thursday."They are interfering with the appointment of CEO because of their vested interest in the workers' money for 2017 elections," Atwoli said.He said it is not a practice for boards of state corporations to cede powers to recruit, discipline workers to the anti-corruption commission."It is the board that can chose to request the EACC to cross check whether those that are set to be appointed have a clean record and not vise versa," Atwoli said.He said that even the current NSSF CEO Anthony Omerikwa has been summoned at the EACC, adding that they will move to court to stop the anti-graft team from such interference."As a workers&rsquo; representative in the NSSF board, we will move to court to stop EACC from interfering with the ongoing recruitment," he said.
