Shun divisive politics and spread peace instead, Deputy President William Ruto has urged politicians. He asked them to avoid spreading hatred and animosity. Ruto spoke yesterday at Maryhill Girls&rsquo; High School, Thika.He said as the country heads towards elections, it would be toxic to divide the country by causing mayhem. &ldquo;We must build bridges of brotherhood and friendship across communities, tribes, regions and religions because the transformation of Kenya will be faster if we work together,&rdquo; the DP said.Ruto said the country will not forge ahead economically with infighting among politicians and their supporters. &ldquo;We must desist from getting back where we were as a country in 2007 by ensuring that we uphold peace in all our deeds, especially in this season of heightened politics,&rdquo; he said. Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and Thika MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a scoffed at those opposing harambees. They said the spirit of harambee is and would always be part of the Kenyan culture, since a lot has been achieved through fundraisers. Kabogo expressed confidence that the new Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission team will fairly preside over next year&rsquo;s election and give Kenyans the government they desire. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a said the Jubilee Party will easily triumph in next year&rsquo;s elections and urged those dissatisfied with Cord to decamp now. &ldquo;The IEBC does not vote. It is Kenyans who vote and I have no doubt that the Kenyan electorate will vote in Jubilee in next year&rsquo;s election,&rdquo; she said Ruto said the government will increase resources to schools countrywide to develop the existing infrastructure and provide equitable education to pupils. He said the government will do its best to ensure pupils learn in a good environment so that they can acquire knowledge and contribute to nation-building.
