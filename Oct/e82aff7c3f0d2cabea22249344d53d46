The Aga Khan Academy Mombasa has adopted an electronic examination assessment platform &ndash; e-Assessment &ndash; to evaluate the school. This, it says, will eliminate courier costs, leakages and losses in transit. The online exam platform will test students&rsquo; abilities, improve their skills and level of attentiveness. &ldquo;With this new system, we have achieved a guarantee of these basics, in a deployment of new technology that can, in time, render to history the problems associated with printing and distributing hard copy exam papers,&rdquo; Aga Khan Academy Head, Bill O&rsquo;Hearn said.The platform was launched at the school in June.
