Nominated Senator Emma Mbura has said there are attempts to frustrate her into leaving the Jubilee Party so another candidate is given the ticket to run for Rabai MP.She blames it on deputy party leader William Ruto. Mbura on Monday said elements of individual parties still exist in JP, even though they dissolved and merged. She accused Ruto of plotting to endorse her rival Nelson Dzuya. [Former] party leaders still pull in their former party directions, she said. Ruto s URP, President Uhuru Kenyatta s TNA and another 11 parties merged last month. The outspoken senator warned Uhuru and Ruto against endorsing hopefuls, where more than one person is eyeing the Jubilee ticket. If Ruto does not stop party bias and if Uhuru continues ignoring some party members, then Jubilee might be hit by a disastrous mass walkout, Mbura said.Dzuya contested the Rabai seat on the URP ticket at the 2013 election and lost to ODM s William Kamoti.
