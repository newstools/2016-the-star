It is just but a cover-up. It will just be investigations on top of investigations and it will be done until the cows come home.&rdquo;Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu also held a press conference at his office yesterday.He termed the internal audit a normal process every Cabinet Secretary initiates at the end of every financial year.He said the leaked report did not include the ministry's response to the queries the draft report had raised.The CS said the internal auditor was now compiling his final report and the ministry will release it to the public on Wednesday next week.&ldquo;We in the ministry expect to be held accountable. That is why I am here,&rdquo; he said.Dr Mailu also claimed he had invited the EACC, the DCI and the KENAO officials yesterday to investigate the ministry.He was flanked by his Principal Secretary, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, who earlier apologised for having threatened a journalist.The EACC deputy Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mubea, said the anti-graft agency will submit an interim report on investigations into the Sh5 billion scandal.Mubea said that a team of detectives has been set up to trace and examine documents related to suspicious payments made by the Ministry of Health to various companies.He disclosed the EACC has been investigating some of the payments at the Ministry of Health, but has been compelled to set up a team of investigators to probe the latest audit reports in the media.&ldquo;Kenyans will get an update on how far investigations have progressed within one week. We have met the Cabinet Secretary, who has agreed to [provide] all the documents for our perusal. We hope to get the documents either by end of today or latest tomorrow. Detectives will be looking at the documents and we assure the public that these investigations will not be delayed," Mubea said.He dismissed reports that some of the documents related to companies adversely mentioned in the audit report were missing, saying the EACC has a way of obtaining such documents and are not at all worried.
