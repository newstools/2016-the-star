Only four ministries have given reports on how many tenders they have given to the youth, women and persons living with disabilities.The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunities was told yesterday only four counties have also done so.National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich said regulations on reporting are being developed so departments, instead of ministries, will present their reports. As per the law, reports are supposed to be done every six months. In the absence of the regulations, the law is not followed, committee chairman Johnson Sakaja said.The committee directed the government to come up with a full report on the 30 per cent procurement in the next four weeks. Rotich said delayed payments will be made in the 30 days.
