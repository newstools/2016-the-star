Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has threatened to file impeachment motion against Education CS Fred Matiangi for abuse of office.He said the CS's action of interdicting education officials in Siaya County without an opportunity for the lot to explain themselves falls short of requirements of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015. The officials were interdicted after an exam with the photo of Governor Cornel Rasanga was shared widely on social media.Read: Siaya education officials interdicted, exam cancelled over Rasanga photo Wandayi said: "Worse still, the said officials have been curiously and promptly replaced by persons who could only have been positioned strategically on the sidelines awaiting the opportunities to be availed," "This is unacceptable and we demand that Matiang'i rescinds this decision immediately and unconditionally," the ODM political affairs secretary said.He said through such actions, Matiang'i was implementing a jubilee scheme to curtail progress of the Luo nation. "We hold him personally responsible. I am putting Matiangi on notice that upon receipt of any unsatisfactory results of the 2016 KCPE examinations, I will be leading the people of Siaya County in instituting prompt and severe legal proceedings against him and the Jubilee Administration," Wandayi said. "I will also concurrently sponsor a motion of impeachment against him in the National Assembly at that time," he said.Wandayi argued that standard eight pupils in Siaya County had been subjected to extremely cruel psychological torture and their performance in the scheduled KCPE examinations irredeemably jeopardised by the CS's actions.Wandayi said: "Why has Matiangi picked on Siaya to punish innocent children? This blatant act of discrimination is in total contravention of the express provisions of Article 27(1), (4) and (5) of the Constitution,""Moreover, by this single misguided act, Matiangi has curtailed the rights of Siaya children to free and compulsory basic education, contrary to the provisions of Article 53(1)(b) of the Constitution," he said. Wandayi claimed the argument by Matiangi that mocks had long been banned is an insult to the intelligence of the people of Siaya.He said the fact of the matter was mocks had been administered, and continue to be administered even today, in schools across the country under the watch the CS and his mandarins at Jogoo House.Examples of counties in which mocks have been undertaken this third term include Tharaka Nithi, Makueni, Kakamega, Nyamira, Embu, Muranga, Kericho, Uasin Gishu and Nyeri. "It's also a fact that most, if not all, of these mocks have been sponsored by people or entities other than the National government. In short, Siaya is not an exception," he said.Read: Exam personalised for Gucha politician exposed after Matiang'i interdicts Siaya officials
