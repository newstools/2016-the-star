Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya has said he can see Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma succeed him at the council's helm.He said Ranguma has the required experience to bring all the 47 governors together and ensure devolution succeeds."I have walked in Kisumu and I have seen a big change, which has been brought by devolution. This means Ranguma is working," he said.Munya was speaking on Thursday when he handed over the devolution torch to the Kisumu county boss.He urged the electorate to ensure Ranguma returns to office in 2017 so he can complete projects started in the region.Read: I'll trounce rivals - Ranguma"I can see you are very happy with your governor and you are going to re-elect him. How many are saying Ranguma tena?" he said, to which the crowd answered in the affirmative.Munya also commended Ranguma's work as chairman in the council's Health Committee, saying Ranguma has ensured the provision of health services is boosted.Cord leader Raila Odinga's wife, Ida, was also lauded Ranguma changing Kisumu with devolution."Kisumu has long been sidelined by various regimes but now we see the changes devolution has brought especially in early childhood education, agriculture and infrastructure," she said."What we now need to do as people is to jelously guard devolution," she added.Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said devolution is a new concept, therefore current governors need a second term to fully implement their development agenda."Some people are just accusing governors of having failed because they are outside. They don't know the challenges we are going through," he said.ODM chairman John Mbadi asked those eyeing governorship positions to play mature politics so they do not block the incumbent."There are internal issues which we can handle in-house but our political differences should not hinder the success of devolution," he said.Munya's open endorsement of Ranguma s re-election could trigger another round of rivalry between Senators and Governors, with Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o having declared his interest to unseat the incumbent.More on this: Nyong o apologises for backing Ranguma as Kisumu governor"I see my brother Ranguma here has no problem.
