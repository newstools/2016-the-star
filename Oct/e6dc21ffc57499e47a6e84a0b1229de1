More than 100 Nairobi doctors have been given 72 hours to explain why they should not be suspended for taking part in an illegal strike.The doctors, who went on strike over delayed salaries and promotions, have insisted that their demands have not been meet despite the signing of a deal.But county secretary Robert Ayisi has also maintained that the county has addressed all the issues the medics raised, including payment of Sh34 million in six-month salary arrears."The county has obtained a court order stopping the strike. We cannot allow the doctors to continue holding the county at ransom," he told journalists on Thursday."As a county, we have done a lot. We wonder why the doctors are still on strike. We have tried to talk to them but they have not heeded."Read: Paralysis as striking Nairobi doctors walk out of talks with county over promotionThe secretary said the county may resort to sacking medics who will not resume duty."Sacking is a process. It is not a one-time event as you have to issue show-cause letters, give them time to respond and suspend them if they fail," he said.Ayisi had earlier asked qualified doctors without jobs to report to CEOs of various facilities to be assigned part-time jobs held by 105 medics.He also directed more than 100 interns who have been taking part in the strike to report back to the ministry of health for redeployment.Nairobi Assembly Health committee chairman Manoah Mboku welcomed the county's decision to issue show-cause letters to the doctors."Patients are suffering and Kenyatta National Hospital is full because our doctors have refused to listen. They should be sacked," he said.The medics went on strike early in September over unpaid salaries, delayed promotions and failure by the county government to issue appointment letters to 53 doctors among others.They called off their three-week strike on September 30 after signing a deal with Evans Kidero's government.But the group downed their tools once again on October 14, demanding promotion and remittance of statutory and non-statutory deductions.More on this: Nairobi doctors call off strike after deal with county
