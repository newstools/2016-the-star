Maternal health has improved remarkably in the three years since health services were devolved, governors have said. They said child deaths have reduced, with the latest statistics showing a 23 per cent decline since 2013, when devolution came into effect. Council of Governors&rsquo; Health Committee deputy chairman Paul Chepkwony attributed the reduction to increased investment in incubators.He said more health facilities have been put up bringing services closer to the people. Chepkwony spoke on Tuesday during the opening of a health sector forum for county executives, chief officers and health directors at the Flamingo Resort in Mombasa.The Kericho governor said services that were inaccessible in remote regions are now available. He said women in Mandera and Garissa can now undergo caesarian section.&ldquo;Eliminating infant mortality is a priority. Counties have invested in incubators and brought health facilities closer to our mothers. These investments have paid off,&rdquo; Chepkwony said.&ldquo;Private hospitals are referring patients to public hospitals because the facilities have improved.&rdquo;Overcoming challengesChepkwony said despite problems, they have increased the number of health centres and dispensaries from 8,466 in 2012 to 10,032.Counties have hired 10,205 doctors and nurses compared to 7,494 recruited by the national government by 2013, he said. &ldquo;Counties provide affordable medical care despite the challenges and resistance faced. We still have a shortage of personnel to serve the health facilities effectively,&rdquo; Chepkwony said.The committee wants the government to allocate 15 per cent of the national budget to the sector.
