Former cabinet minister Noah Wekesa has dismissed the much touted National Super Alliance (Nasa) saying it will not shake Jubilee Party in 2017.Wekesa said the opposition alliance will lose to Jubilee if Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi is named its presidential candidate."Settling on Mudavadi will not scare Jubilee in Western," he said. "Such a move will cause a lot of disharmony in Nyanza and Ukambani which feel Raila Odinga or Kalonzo Musyoka [are] the right candidates for the opposition."Wekesa said only Raila, who is Cord leader, will give Jubilee a run for its money if he is the joint opposition's candidate.The ruling coalition is led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.The former Jubilee coordinating committee co-chair spoke during a breakfast show on KBC on Tuesday.Wekesa's remarks come amid Mudavadi's efforts to champion the formation of a super alliance that would bring together Amani, Cord and other like-minded parties to remove Jubilee from power.The Amani leader said the alliance would be broad-based and also involve labour movements, religious leaders and members of the business community.More on this: Jubilee will rule for 200 years after flooring Cord in 2017 polls, Wekesa saysMudavadi is expected to sell Nasa's agenda in Busia and Kakamega counties during a tour this weekend.But Western leaders told him they will not leave the ruling coalition as he led them to it.They said it was Mudavadi who negotiated for Jubilee to work with UDF before he gave up the outfit to form Amani National Coalition.More on this: We will not leave Jubilee, you led us there, Western MPs tell Mudavadi[VIDEO] Raila crafting 'super alliance' of opposition
