Spring Valley-Matopeni MCA Abdi Guyo has appealed to the Nairobi county government to help residents of his ward, whose houses were razed by fire, to reconstruct their lives. Several houses and shops worth millions of shillings were destroyed during the Wednesday incident. The cause of the fire is unknown. Residents said county firefighters acted swiftly and put out the fire, before it could cause massive damage in neighbouring areas. But at least 20 families were left homeless. The county should get some money from the emergency kitty to buy blankets and food for victims. Otherwise, they will continue to suffer, yet we have the emergency fund, Guyo said. He said their ward administrator wrote to City Hall to release the funds.
