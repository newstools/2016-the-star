Tana River Governor Hussein Dado yesterday dismissed the alliance formed by his rivals to unseat him next year.He said the alliance of Garsen MP Ibrahim Sane and former legislator Danson Mungatana will not succeed, as it is engineered by failures . Dado said both leaders are unproductive and should not be trusted by residents to take power.He spoke during a tour of Ngao, Mungatana s backyard. Dado told residents to reject them. He said the leaders criticise his leadership, yet they sought help from him in Nairobi. They re the same people who come to beg for money from me. I help them, Dado said.He met with Ngao Girls KCSE candidates and gave them a token ahead of their exams. The governor later launched the refurbished maternity wing at the Ngao Subcounty Hospital. He proceeded to Ngao trading centre for a fundraiser for 22 groups. Dado urged voters to elect those who have their interests at heart. He said he implements development projects without favouritism. They raised Sh2.2 million, including Sh700,000 from him. I kindly ask you to vote for me. Even if I get a half of your votes, I ll also get some from other areas so I win. We must work together, Dado said.
