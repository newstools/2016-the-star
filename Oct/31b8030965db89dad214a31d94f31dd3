Forty-six out of 59 Machakos MCAs have signed a petition to impeach Governor Alfred Mutua.In the list seen by the Star yesterday, 39 of the 40 elected members and seven of the 19 nominated members had appended their signatures by 10.00am.Sources said the ward representatives held a closed-door meeting yesterday to prepare for the motion to be tabled in the assembly this week.An MCA, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Star the motion would be presented in the house business committee yesterday for balloting.The assembly members are accusing the governor of abuse of office and abetting corruption.They also want to remove assembly majority leader Joshua Mwonga, who is said to be the only elected member who has not signed the petition to impeach Mutua.Asked for campaign fundsLast week the governor hinted at the possibility of an impeachment motion against him when he accused MCAs of demanding campaign funds from him. I am told that some MCAs are planning to impeach me because I have refused to fund their campaigns in the coming elections. I want to tell them to proceed with their plans because the only money I have is for development, Mutua said as he unveiled the Mulu Mutisya Statute at Mulu Mutisya grounds on Wednesday.His assertions sparked anger from members, who immediately called a press briefing to deny the allegations.Led by minority leader Thomas Kasoa, the members said they are only demanding bursary funds, the Ward Development Fund and the completion of stalled projects. They denied asking for campaign funds.The MCAs accused the governor of failing to develop Machakos and only playing public relations. We are asking the governor to provide the piped water that he promised to each household; we are asking him to give bursaries to our children, complete the stalled ECD centres and the market shades, Kasoa said.This comes in the wake of allegations last week, when the county assembly members said millions of shillings of the Machakos revenue is being channelled to a private bank account through a till number.
