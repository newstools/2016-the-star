In recent times, the Nairobi National Park has been threatened with increasing progress projects meant to improve the standard of living for people. Sadly, some projects are being done at the expense of one of Kenya s priceless treasures, the park itself. It is good to see any nation improve and upgrade its infrastructure, but not when a gazetted national park is being systematically chop, chop, chopped. The park is only 117 sq km in size and is internationally renowned as a unique place, where wildlife lives in close proximity to the Nairobi city of over four million people. The proposal that the Standard Gauge railway be constructed through the park is highly unacceptable, when considering the permanent destruction of habitat and the effect on wildlife. God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth, and the Nairobi park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for posterity. If this generation does not act now, then Kenya stands to lose large chunks of a precious national asset. To secure the park, serious steps need to be taken to ensure the SGR takes an alternative route around the park to minimise the impact on the environment and community. In June 2010, approximately 20,000 people joined hands and formed a human chain for the Nairobi Greenline along the eastern boundary of the park, effectively stating that the line was drawn to protect the park. I believe the current crisis calls for thousands of people to unite again and form another human chain, because unity is strength.
