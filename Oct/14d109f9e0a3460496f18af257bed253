The border point will open this region to development as it will ensure trade is maximised and attract investors, he said.The border point will prevent the delay of goods and reduce the waiting time by more than 70 per cent, Yatani said. It will also make customs and importation flexible as residents will be access services at one point, he said.Kenya and Ethiopia signed a bilateral agreement in 2011 to develop the joint border point and road that will enhance bilateral trade.The border post is funded by the African Development Bank at Sh843 million. The project will also link Marsabit to the Trans-Africa Highway that links Nairobi to Addis Ababa.Delayed completionThe Sh843 million border project was set to be complete by May, but contractors sought an extension in the contract due to poor terrain that saw construction halting a number of times.Speaking to the Star, one of the engineers said heavy rains made it difficult for them to work, disrupting progress of the work.The engineer said it took longer than they had planned to construct the border point due to poor coordination with the Ethiopian side. The terrain here was quite challenging and the rains also are a challenge when construction is underway, the engineer said.The contractors also said hostility and inter-ethnic conflicts between communities from Kenya and Ethiopia disrupted their work.But they are on schedule to complete the project by December and will await for the Ethiopian side and the Trans Africa Highway constructions to be complete before operations at the border point start.
