In the years before the 2010 Constitution, a phrase frequently used to describe popular politicians was &ldquo;development-conscious leaders&rdquo;.In using this phrase, the speakers meant that this man or woman was to be found, on most weekends, in one village or another raising funds for a church or mosque; for a school or a market; for paying a hospital bill or school fees.And in-between, the &ldquo;Mheshimiwa&rdquo; would be found in the upper echelon offices of a ministry or a parastatal, with a large bundle of CVs, trying to get jobs for his constituents.I don&rsquo;t know if the dedicated job hunt that so many MPs used to undertake &mdash; walking from office to office with the CVs &mdash; still goes on, but, of course, the days of the mandatory weekly harambee meetings are definitely over. For it was in time revealed that the pressure placed on MPs to attend these meetings and make donations was one of the principal drivers of corruption.This drove some MPs to accept &ldquo;brown envelopes&rdquo; to do some favours to some &ldquo;power-broker&rdquo; who wanted their support for his political agenda; or by a crooked public official determined to escape a proper investigation into his management style.In short, the burdens of being an elected leader, who genuinely sought to improve the lives of his people, were immense; and the temptations that came with it were virtually irresistible. With devolution, a lot has changed. An MP or governor no longer has the burden of seeking wealthy patrons to help him or her &ldquo;bring development&rdquo; to his people. There is money allocated by the central government for precisely this purpose.And so a new question arises: Why is it that all we have seen thus far, is an unending display of opulence and uncontrolled spending by the county governments?Why are we not seeing outbursts of joy all across the country, as elected leaders &mdash; governors as much as MPs &mdash; proceed to &ldquo;deliver development&rdquo; on an unprecedented scale?As one who has access to the hundreds of incoming &lsquo;Letters to the Editor&rsquo; emails every week, as well as dozens of unsolicited opinion columns sent in by ordinary Kenyans, I can tell you a good many of these are devoted to expressions of outrage.There is a great deal of silent fury out there over the question of why we, Kenyans, are such fools who always choose &ldquo;the worst crooks&rdquo; to lead us &mdash; particularly at the county level.But these are the few who have access to computers and the internet, and who are accustomed to making their feelings known.When it comes to the ordinary Kenyan voter &mdash; a rural farmer or herdsman &mdash; I do not think self-righteous fury is what propels him or her to vote for this candidate or the other. My reading of the situation is that county voting will follow much the same pattern as presidential voting, and that it will have nothing to do with development.For it seems to me that &mdash; armed with peasant cunning &mdash; what that average Kenyan really believes is that &ldquo;there is not enough for everybody&rdquo; of the much coveted &ldquo;national cake&rdquo;.It could not be otherwise in a poor country. And I would argue that what voters, in any part of the nation, look for in a presidential candidate is not so much a fair and just leader, devoted to equitable distribution of resources, but rather one who will deliver &ldquo;development&rdquo; to their part of the country, specifically, at the expense of others. This is what I predict will happen at the county elections as well now that voters have a clear idea of the resources that &ldquo;Their Excellencies&rdquo; the governors have at their disposal. They will not vote for farsighted leadership focussed on long-term and comprehensive development.Rather they will seek the man or woman who, before the ink is dry on his oath of office, will rush to the county treasury, grab as much as possible of the devolved kitty, and spend it on their own cluster of villages at the expense of everybody else.
