Kitui Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s wife Edith Mawia has said the elaborate posthumous glorification of people should end.&ldquo;We must get used to praising, applauding and rewarding people who do remarkable things to improve or change other people's live for the better when they are still alive. We do not need to wait and shower them with praise when they die,&rdquo; Mawia said.
