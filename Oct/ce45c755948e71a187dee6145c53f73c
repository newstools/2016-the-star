National Classic men&rsquo;s league defending champions Ulinzi Warriors will for the first time participate in the FIBA Afrique Afro-basket final tour next month.This is after games&rsquo; organizing body, Fiba Africa granted Zone Five two slots for the final tour set for December 7-12 in Cairo, Egypt.According to FIBA Zone Five secretary general Vitalis Gode, Ulinzi Warriors, who finished second at the zonal qualifiers in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania early this month, will join championships winners City Oilers from Uganda at the African show in Cairo.Women Zone Five champions Kenya Ports Authority and United States international University (USIU) women, who finished second have already confirmed their participation in the final tour to be staged in Maputo, Mozambique from November 24 to December 4.&ldquo;Ulinzi Warriors gave a good account of themselves at the qualifiers to finish second and it&rsquo;s only fair that we allow them an opportunity to play in the final tour which will not only expose the players to international club but will also develop the game locally,&rdquo; Gode said.The secretary has therefore urged the teams to step up their training to allow the Kenya teams post a good performance when they meet other top sides in the continent.&ldquo;I am personally very impressed with the KPA women team that took part in the qualifiers and strongly believe they will post good results in Mozambique,&rdquo; he said.KPA missed last year&rsquo;s championships in Angola but USIU, who took part finished ninth overall.
