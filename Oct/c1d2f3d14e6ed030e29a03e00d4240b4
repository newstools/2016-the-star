It has long been a complaint among academics here in Kenya that our elections give them very little to analyse.Kenyan presidential elections, in particular, have long been dismissed as an ethnic census which only serves to tell us approximately how many voters each tribe has.Well, it looks like we are at last about to have an election in which the ideas our academics claim to seek in vain will actually be very much present. Indeed in light of recent alignments, it seems like the 2017 election will be a referendum on what is the more effective kind of political coalition for this country.Consider the Jubilee Party set up by the merging of President Uhuru Kenyatta s former party, TNA, and Deputy President William Ruto s URP and 10 smaller parties that were absorbed therein.The JP idea is that what the country needs is mega-parties, with an electoral footprint in every corner of the country. The model here is something very similar to South Africa s ANC, or Tanzania s CCM.Where such powerful parties exist, and dominate the political landscape, the decision as to who will be the next President or Prime Minister is not primarily made by the voters or at the ballot.Rather, the party s big chiefs decide, among themselves, who their next flagbearer will be and announce the decision to the general public. In some cases, there is an elaborate pretense that delegates voted in favour of the man who has just been sent forth to fly the party colours in the general election. But that is just a charade and everybody knows it.Getting such a party from power is not easy, but it does happen from time to time. Such as in Kenya in 2002 when Kanu, long boasted of as the Independence party which would put it on par with Tanzania s CCM and South Africa s ANC lost to Narc, an alliance of opposition parties in its 39th year of power.If anyone had told our long-serving President of the time, Daniel Moi, that a day would come in his lifetime when Kanu would be a small-time, two-bit party; that Kanu would be completely overshadowed by the larger political parties of the day; he would have laughed out loud. And speaking of that opposition coalition, it presents a totally different model for creating a political vehicle, which might propel its presidential candidate to victory next year.This coalition, thus far, consists of ODM led by Raila Odinga, Wiper Party led by Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford-Kenya led by Senator Moses Wetang ula; and Kenya s ANC the Amani National Congress led by Musalia Mudavadi.This is the group that Kanu, now led by Senator Gideon Moi, is said to be planning to join.Their approach is completely different. There can be no question of all these four or five parties merging into one giant party. The realities of Kenyan opposition politics simply will not allow it. For each of these parties has their own political backyard in which they are very strong: A strength they might easily lose if they appear to have thrown away the party identity that gave them their regional strength.However, keen as the voters out in the villages may be to retain our party as a unique and vibrant political entity, they do understand having the incumbent President presented with half-a-dozen or so opposition presidential candidates to compete with, is no way to defeat the political establishment they despise. So, just as happened in 2013 with both Cord and Jubilee, the opposition is taking the big tent approach.There is to be no single all-powerful opposition party. Instead, there is room for any number of separate political parties, who can field candidates wherever they please, provided they all unite to support the single presidential candidate of the joint opposition.This may not be as neat an arrangement as the JP: But it is precisely the kind of setup which enabled the opposition leaders of 2002 to uproot Kanu from power.
