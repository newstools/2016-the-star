One of Africa's most celebrated music icons Awilo Longomba is headed to Nairobi for a mega concert.The Congolese Lingala maestro will be the headlining act in the 15th edition of Koroga Festival slated for November 27 at the Arboretum Gardens.Awilo, known for his exciting dance moves, gained worldwide fame thanks to his 1998 album Coupe Bibamba, his second after Moto Pamba of 1995.However, he went on a hiatus at around 2008 but resurfaced just over two years ago with new hits.In his latest music, the music legend has collaborated with even younger artistes among them popular Nigerian duo P-Square in the song Enemy Solo."My disappearance has to do with promotional issues," he told Vanguard.He added, "After releasing my hit album (Super-Man), I was wanted all over the world. "I didn&rsquo;t disappear, rather, I was busy touring the whole world and entertaining my fans. Honestly, I think you should inquire from the DJs about me. "Yes, I went underground for some years now, but now, I&rsquo;m back."Awilo started as a drummer in music bands such as Viva la Musica, Stukas, Nouvelle Generation and Loketo. In 1995, however, he finally quit drumming for singing and released Moto Pamba, following it up with Coupe Bibamba three years later.He released Kafou Kafou in 2001, Mondongo (2004) and Super-Man in 2008. Super-Man won the Best Soukous Entertainer Award in the 2009 edition of the International Reggae and World Music Awards.Some of his most popular hits includes Cache Cache, Gate le Coin, Coupe Bibamba, Porokondo and Abidjan Debout.
