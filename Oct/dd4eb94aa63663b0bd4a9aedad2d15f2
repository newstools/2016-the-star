"I didn t disappear, rather, I was busy touring the whole world and entertaining my fans. Honestly, I think you should inquire from the DJs about me. "Yes, I went underground for some years now, but now, I m back."Awilo started as a drummer in music bands such as Viva la Musica, Stukas, Nouvelle Generation and Loketo. In 1995, however, he finally quit drumming for singing and released Moto Pamba, following it up with Coupe Bibamba three years later.He released Kafou Kafou in 2001, Mondongo (2004) and Super-Man in 2008.
