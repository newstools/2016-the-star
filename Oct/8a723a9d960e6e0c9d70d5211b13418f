The Sports Dispute Tribunal has dismissed Moses Mbuthia&rsquo;s petition in its entirety, against Kenya Volleyball Federation, challenging the latter&rsquo;s legality.All prayers desired by Mbuthia and second petitioner Charles Nyaberi were ruled against. In the April 26 2014 elections, Mbuthia lost the KVF&rsquo;s presidency seat to Waithaka Kioni, whereas Nyaberi was defeated by one vote by Martin Makokha in the position of vice chairmanship.In his pleadings, Mbuthia argued that the April 26 2014 elections were flawed with procedural and substantive illegalities and prayed that they be declared a nullity and that the current office holders be declared illegal and that the Tribunal to constitute a caretaker committee for KVF.The Sports Dispute Tribunal employed a single denominator&mdash;whether or not the petitioner (Mbuthia) is entitled to the prayers sought&mdash;in determining the case.Appearing for KVF, counsel Migwi Mungai pleaded with the Tribunal that Mbuthia is not entitled to any of the remedies sought because he has approached the court late&mdash;two years and four months&mdash;since the cause of action arose. Mungai also submitted that &lsquo;Equity does not aid the indolent&rsquo;. Thiophilus Kamwaro, lawyer for Mbuthia argued &ldquo;An illegality is an illegality, unless the action is barred by a statute, it remains a valid action,&rdquo;Tribunal panel of John Ohaga (chairman), members Peter Ochieng and Gabriel Ouko in their ruling noted: &ldquo;A party who wishes to enforce his rights before any tribunal must do so within a reasonable time and must be prompt. On this issue, it is our finding that the delay in filing this petition is inordinate and inexcusable,&rdquo;&ldquo;In addition, it would be in the interest of public administration to adjudicate finally in such matters at the earliest time possible,&rdquo; underscored the ruling.&ldquo;The petitioner has not met the sill of proof required for the tribunal to declare the elections a nullity,&rdquo; determined the panel.
