Nairobi business owners will no longer need to apply for numerous permits as the county is set to launch the Unified Business Permit.Traders were previously required to make separate applications for several permits including fire, signage and health.But the unified permit ensures they only make one application to cover all operational requirements."It is something positive that residents should embrace because it goes a long way in improving their lives," Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said on Friday.Mueke, who was behind the implementation of the county's e-payment system, said the method will ensure business people are not arrested for late or non-payments.He dismissed reports that the county has lost revenue while using the electronic payment platform.Residents will apply for the unified permit through an online payment portal run by JamboPay.It takes less than five minutes to apply for a single business permit.City Hall's revenue department said the system will increase returns by reducing instances where businesses default payments for different permits.The Nairobi county enforcement department has been arresting residents for failing to pay for fire licenses and sign-age.The traders have occasionally been forcefully ferried to City Hall to do so and pay a Sh2,000 fine before being released.In May last year, two officers from the enforcement department were said to have fought over a Sh2,000 bribe from a hair salon attendant arrested at the Mall in Westlands.The officers were later summoned at City Hall to explain why they allegedly demanded the bribe.
