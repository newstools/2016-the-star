It is not clear what she discussed with the man identified as William Kisumo.But the woman representative only managed to irk Kenyans with her act, some saying she was on a vote-hunting mission."This is absolutely raping our morals; it's disgusting and pure lack of common sense for political mileage," said Twitter user Munene Victor.Daniel Kyalo wrote: "This is the biggest hypocrite I have seen in October. Where has she been for four years? The county government has messed Nairobi city and we should vote all these fellows out."Patrick Omondi said: "I can boldly say here that Rachel Shebesh is the worst thing that has ever happened to Nairobi."Owen O'wch noted Shebesh had the power to do much for the people over a period of five years, but was now "pulling a Pauline stunt".Other social media users lodged personal attacks against Shebesh asking her to change her hairstyle."I think it's time for the style to change if people recognise you from your wig," said Galgallo Isacko.The woman representative did not respond to phone calls and messages for comment.
