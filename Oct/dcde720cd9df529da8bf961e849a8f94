Mihango MCA Paul Kados spent Monday night at Kayole police station that he helped construct some years back.The MCA said on Tuesday that he was saddened by the deplorable state of the facility which lacked water for remandees.Kados said he was appalled that even officers did not have the luxury of clean water.The ward representative noted he also helped with the construction of Kibiko and Mihango police posts."But I appeal to the county government and well wishers to even sink a borehole at Kayole police station," he said."Our officers and remandees do not have water. This should not go on."The MCA retired from his AP officer post before joining politics and has served the area for the last 15 years, first as councilor and now as MCA.Residents heaped praise on him as a development-conscious man.The MCA was arrested on Monday for leading protesting against the KDF's closure of Mihango-Kayole link road.Read: MCA arrested for demo against KDF closure of Mihango-Kayole road He was later charged with incitement to violence in a Makadara court on grounds that he uttered words which aimed at bringing injury and destruction to the Kayole community."We will continue to block and burn tyres on this road until midnight. Let the police arrest us. We will go to court and come back to block the road until they listen to us," he reportedly said.Kiguathi was detained at the station until 2pm on Tuesday pending the determination of his bond terms.Governor Evans Kidero said he will instruct his lawyers to secure the MCA's release should he not be granted bond.Kidero told the Star he was saddened by KDF's closure of the road since it has abruptly cut off movement between Kayole and Mihango."Children who live on either side cannot access schools (quickly). They now get to school at 10 am. KDF should have alerted residents to allow them to prepare," the Governor said.He added that the notification would also have allowed the county to seek alternative routes for residents.Kidero said that according to the Nairobi master plan of 1980, the road cutting through a section of the KDF land was to act as a link to the recently constructed Eastern bypass."This is something that had been envisioned. The KDF should allow residents to use the road," he said.
