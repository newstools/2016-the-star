All girls who will be sitting for their KCPE and KCSE exams in Lamu county will be given free sanitary pads.This will ensure the girls do not miss exams due to lack of the sanitary towels.Governor Issa Timamy's wife Hajara El-Busaidy, who initiated the project last year, said she received 3,000 sanitary towels from the LAP Fund.&ldquo;We started this project of sanitary towels to help the girls perform well in their examinations," she said.Speaking in Faza Island when she launched the distribution programme yesterday, El-Busaidy said any extra sanitary towels will be donated to orphanages and children centres for girls.She said she approached donors to give them sanitary towels because girls in the county found it difficult to concentrate in class and during exams when they are their menstruation &ndash; roughly 60 days a year.Some skip classes, El-Busaidy said.&ldquo;We visited all wards in the county and toured both primary and secondary schools, and found there was need to support the girls," she said.El-Busaidy said that when they distribute the pads, they also take along women role models to boost the girls' morale and ensure they work hard for a better future.Among the role models in Lamu are the LAP Fund director and First Woman captain in Lamu Ruweida Mohamed .&ldquo;Our aim is to show the girls that they can be doctors, teachers, captains and all the positions they want in life by working hard," El-Busaidy said.For the boys, there is a programme to give them geometrical sets for exams.Residents thanks El-Busaidy for initiating the sanitary towel programme and asked her to look for more donors to ensure all girls get free pads.
