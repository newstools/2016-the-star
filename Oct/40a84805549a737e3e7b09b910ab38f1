A double-pronged plot is thickening in Parliament to help opposition MPs de-whipped from committees return, contrary to the wishes of their political parties. De-whipped opposition MPs may find their way back to committees after National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale and the Justice Committee launched two attempts to rescue them.Speaker Justin Muturi is expected to give a ruling on the constitutionality of removing members from committees following a request by Duale. Justice committee chairman Samuel Chepkonga has also filed a petition to change the Standing Orders. The petition seeks to take away the powers of political parties to remove their members from committees. Duale said it is undemocratic to deny affected members a fair hearing.
