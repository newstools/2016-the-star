Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday told Kenyans to be wary of leaders who are out to divide them through inflammatory statements.Ruto said that the Jubilee Administration wants the citizens to live in peace and will not engage in divisive politics.He at the same time said that tribal politics will not take the country anywhere in terms of development.The DP said the merger of parties into Jubilee was to deal with negative ethnicity, adding that JP is the only outfit that can unite Kenyans."I am urging you to shun leaders who are out to divide you. Jubilee government wants people to live in peace," Ruto said at Nyabururu Parish, Kisii County.The DP was the chief guest at a funds drive in aid of the church where he urged the Kisii community to overwhelmingly vote for Jubilee. Expressing confidence that JP will win the 2017 poll, he said the ruling coalition has done much in the four years they have been in office."Vote for a party that has your interests at heart," he told the congregation, "In 2013, you voted for ODM but I know that you have changed your minds to be in a winning party,"Those who attended the ceremony included Bishop Joseph Mairura of the Kisii Diocese, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Senator Chris Obure, Mps Richard Onyonka, Zebedeo Opore, Richard Tong&rsquo;i, Stephen Manoti, and Jimmy Angwenyi.Former CIC chairman Charles Nyachae also attended the fundraiser among other guests.The DP scoffed at the opposition as only good at organising protests."The opposition is good in organising protests and attacking the government. So, it is high time that you ignored it," he&nbsp; said.Touching on the conflict at the Kisii-Narok border, Ruto said that the government will not tolerate a few people who are out to make people fight.He said that the government will take serious actions against individuals who engage in cattle rustling, calling such persons 'useless'."Those who will be arrested over cattle rustling should be given a longer sentence to curb the menace in future," Ruto said.The government will not tolerate such useless individuals who are out to make communities that live in peace fight, he added.Maangi and Angwenyi criticised Cord leader Raila Odinga for likening the community with chicken, saying that it a bad insult.The two called on opposition leader to give the community the respect it deserves.
