The Homa Bay government has received eight computers worth Sh1.5 million from the UNDP. They will be used for automation of revenue collection. The UNDP has been helping the county governments embrace change and institutionalise a performance culture in public service. The machines will increase efficiency, especially in data management. Revenue collection and storing health records will be made easier, Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata said. He spoke on Wednesday when he received the computers from chief of staff Isaac Abuya. All the counties are rushing towards achieving this, hence Homa Bay should not be left behind [in the quest for] full economic development, Orata said.
