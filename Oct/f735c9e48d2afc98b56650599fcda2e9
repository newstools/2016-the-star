Boda boda riders have lost a bid to continue operating in the Nairobi central business district.Justice Joseph Onguto said on Monday that they failed to prove to the court that their rights were violated when the county ordered them out of the CBD.Onguto dismissed the case filed by the riders in February. The operators were stopped from operating within the city by Governor Evans Kidero in November 2015.Their operations were banned in line with provisions of the Traffic Act CAP 403 of 2014.They moved to court to block the Governor, arguing they were not informed prior to the decision to bar them from the CBD.Also read: NTSA introduce regulations for bodaboda operators
