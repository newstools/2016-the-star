Mihang o MCA Paul Kados has asked the county government to provide remandees at the Kayole police station with water and essential services.He recently spent the night in the station s cell after he was arrested for allegedly leading residents in protests against the closure of the Mihang o-Kayole link roads by the KDF. Kados was last Monday charged in a Makadara court with incitement to violence.He was released on Sh300,000 bail. The MCA said after spending the night at the Kayole police station, he was saddened by its deplorable condition, since there is no water for remandees and police officers. I helped set up the Kayole police station, the Kibiko police post and the Mihang o police post. I appeal to the county government and well-wishers to help sink a borehole at the Kayole police station. Our officers and the remandees do not have water, he said.
