Mihango MCA Paul Kados yesterday was arrested and locked up at the Embakasi police station for leading residents in a protest against the closure of the Mihango-Kayole road by the Kenya Defence Forces. The road cuts through the barracks land and it is the only link between Mihango and Kayole villages. It was built in 1999.The protest began at 6am. There has never been a problem between us and the soldiers. We were surprised to wake one morning and find the road had been blocked, residents said. Police arrived and dispersed the crowd. They arrested several residents for unlawful assembly.But Kados said police were notified of the protest. It s unfair to arrest us, yet we have the right to protest against the barbaric actions of KDF officers, who dug a trench right across the road. Residents have no alternative, he said on the phone from the police cell.On Friday, residents barricaded the Eastern Bypass. KDF is yet to issue a statement on what informed its closure. Area MP John Omondi said closing the road was in bad faith and will trigger animosity between residents and the soldiers.
