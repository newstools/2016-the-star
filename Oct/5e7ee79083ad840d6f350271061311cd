Mihango MCA Paul Kados yesterday was arrested and locked up at the Embakasi police station for leading residents in a protest against the closure of the Mihango-Kayole road by the Kenya Defence Forces. The road cuts through the barracks&rsquo; land and it is the only link between Mihango and Kayole villages. It was built in 1999.The protest began at 6am. &ldquo;There has never been a problem between us and the soldiers. We were surprised to wake one morning and find the road had been blocked,&rdquo; residents said. Police arrived and dispersed the crowd. They arrested several residents for unlawful assembly.But Kados said police were notified of the protest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to arrest us, yet we have the right to protest against the barbaric actions of KDF officers, who dug a trench right across the road. Residents have no alternative,&rdquo; he said on the phone from the police cell.On Friday, residents barricaded the Eastern Bypass. KDF is yet to issue a statement on what informed its closure. Area MP John Omondi said closing the road was in bad faith and will trigger animosity between residents and the soldiers.
