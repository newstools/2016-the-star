Tana River cotton farmers will benefit from a Sh30 million programme launched last week in Bura.Anthony Mureithi, the interim director of fibre crops under the Agriculture and Food Authority, said Tana River aims at filling gaps in the value chain, equipping farmers with farm inputs, credit, providing extension services and linking them to the market. The initiative is part of the strategies being fast-tracked to revive cotton farming. We are working with the county governments and other players. We expect to reclaim our lost glory in cotton farming, create more wealth and enhance job creation by reviving the agro-industry, he said.The agreement was signed between the Bura Farmers Community-Based Organisation, Meru Ginnery, National Irrigation Board, AFA, Tana River county, Agricultural Finance Corporation, Amiran Kenya, Rivatex EA and the Kenya Agribusiness and Agroindustry Alliance.The value chain players will implement a four-month pilot project before the main season kicks off in February next year. Mureithi said farmers under the programme will receive certified seeds sourced from Israel and other global market segments. Bura MP Ali Wario (pictured) welcomed the initiative, saying farmers will gain, having grappled with a long period of abject poverty. The programme will maximise farmers income, ensure technology transfer and create more wealth, he said.Kenya produces 30,000 bales of cotton annually but needs about 10,000 metric tonnes of lint. Imports bridge the gap.
