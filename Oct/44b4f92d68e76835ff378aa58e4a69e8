In trying to understand the dichotomy between the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) and corruption, one may be tempted to ask Why now?Isn t it curious that these allegations have emerged just days after President Uhuru Kenyatta gave Edward Ouko a very public tongue-lashing, on live TV, over the Eurobond funds?There are scant details about the investigations on the OAG and the accusations being leveled against its head, Ouko.I want to imagine that the OAG, like any other government agency, has a specific department charged with the responsibility of procuring goods and services as required by law.In the same breath, I want to assume the OAG has a tender committee, which is completely divorced from the CEO. On this point, we have not had complaints from its members of undue intrusion by Ouko.On the same score, it is important to know whether, besides Ouko, officials from procurement and members of the tender committee are under investigation.These details are not forthcoming in the attempt by the anti- corruption authorities to prosecute Ouko on allegations of corruption.Yet, it needs no reminder that the OAG, pursuant to the powers conferred on it in the Constitution and the enabling statutes, has lately been dealing with very sensitive matters related to public revenue and expenditure accounts.Right from the Eurobond proceeds, the National Youth Service, etc, the OAG has been investigating and disclosing sensitive matters of a financial nature that have rattled people in high places.Even if, indeed, Ouko has dabbled in corruption as is being alleged, it is not good that he should be berated and subjected to public humiliation, as is the case now.The berating he has been subjected to since Tuesday s Accountability Summit at State House, Nairobi, and the latest accusation by the EACC, demean the office and lower its image before the public.Besides instilling fear, this kind of frontal assault on the OAG s impacts on present and future holders of such office, making them avoid confronting tough decisions that place them in the crosshairs of those who wield raw power.The OAG has been under attack since 2014, when the amendments were effected to the Public Audit Act.The OAG was denied the opportunity to recruit its own staff and it was decreed that any leakage of its reports whatsoever before they reached Parliament would attract a jail term and a fine of about Sh10 million.
