Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said he will ban relief food if elected governor.Kiraitu spoke at Mujwa Catholic Church yesterday. It is shameful that Meru, which is supposed to produce enough food for the entire nation, is starving, he said.Kiraitu said agriculture is a devolved function and resources should be invested to end cycles of poverty. If I become the governor, we are not going to entertain relief food because I know if our people work hard, there will be enough food for all. If we set our priorities right in agriculture and invest enough resources, then nobody will die for lack of food, he said.Kiraitu banned relief food when he was MP for South Imenti constituency in 2002.He, however, said for now, he will talk to Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to send relief food to rescue the starving . Kiraitu urged residents to vote out Governor Peter Munya, alleging his regime has been wasting public resources without promoting development.He lashed out at the county for allegedly spending Sh100 million on hospitality, including buying tea and flowers. I am concerned about the massive waste of resources, Kiraitu said.
