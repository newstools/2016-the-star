Kandara MP Alice Wahome has filed a memorandum seeking the rejection of Justice Philomena Mwilu as the next Deputy Chief Justice. Mwilu will be vetted by MPs today. Wahome claims Mwilu received a Sh3 million bribe to influence the outcome of an election petition filed in 2008. I have credible information that my adversary in the election petition delivered the money to Justice Mwilu at her house at Ridgeways estate to influence the outcome of the election petition, Wahome says in the memorandum dated October 19. The Kandara MP, who says Mwilu lacks the high moral character, integrity and impartiality to be a judge, has asked the Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission to investigate the bribery claim. I m willing to cooperate and supply further information or clarification in the matter for the purposes of investigations, her letter to EACC director Halakhe Waqo dated October 19 reads.
