Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga should be surcharged for spending Sh1.7 million to print mock exam papers with his photo and the slogan &lsquo;Rasanga Tena&rsquo; for standard eight candidates.Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo yesterday said education is under the national government and the counties have no authority to fund exam paper printing.&ldquo;This is misuse of funds and children for campaigns,&rdquo; he said. On Wednesday, Education executive Pamela Akelo defended placing Rasanga&rsquo;s photo on the exam papers.She said, &ldquo;It was meant to prevent parents from being exploited by head teachers who might have wanted to charge children to sit the exam.&rdquo;Akelo said the photos were not a campaign gimmick. On Tuesday, residents criticised the county for the photos. But Akelo said, &ldquo;We realised some head teachers approach organisations to sponsor exam paper printing, only to ask parents and county governments to pay for the same. We printed the photos to distinguish the county mock papers from other documents.&rdquo; She spoke to the Star on the phone on Wednesday.Akelo said the county sponsored exam paper printing to support the education sector because &ldquo;if anything, primary and secondary education are not devolved.&rdquo;
