Kenya s long wait to stage an International Cricket Council (ICC) event will come to an end next month when the country host Hong Kong in the World Cricket League fixture on November 18 and 20 at Nairobi Gymkhana.The two matches will be used as qualifiers for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. This will be the first time Kenya is hosting an ICC event since July 2011 when they hosted United Arab Emirates in the ICC Intercontinental Cup and the World Cricket League matches.Since then, the country has failed to host international matches due to insecurity in the country and to some extent, lack of proper bidding from Kenyan side.But in a statement, Cricket Kenya (CK) chairperson, Jackie Janmohammed, who took over from Samir Inamdar in 2012, said the country was granted the chance to finally host ICC event after joint efforts from the government and CK. The ICC was impressed with the assurance from the Kenya government and the local cricket body that they are able to host a world class event. This is what we have all along been fighting for, which is to have major ICC events in Kenya and top flight cricket matches that will involve the test playing nations. The support that the government gave us helped quite a lot as ICC were impressed with the commitment the government has in developing sports in Kenya, added Janmohammed.The top four countries in the World Cricket League will qualify to play in the 2019 World Cup, whose venue will be decided later. Currently, Kenya are in the 5th position with Hong Kong fourth in the ongoing World Cricket League. Kenya lost their matches against PNG in June this year and won both matches against Namibia . They shared spoils with UAE after winning one mad losing one.
