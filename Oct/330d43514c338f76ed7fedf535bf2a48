There is a plot to remove Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula as Ford Kenya leader, deputy party chief Boni Khalwale said yesterday. He said the &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; will not succeed.Khalwale said activist Ken Wafula &ndash; who says he has been endorsed by some officials and elders to replace Wetang&rsquo;ula &ndash; is not a member of Ford Kenya.&ldquo;From our records, Wafula vied for the Senate seat in Trans Nzoia in 2013 through Safina party. He has never defected to Ford Kenya. He is not a member and should keep off Ford Kenya affairs,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.Khalwale said Wafula is being used by &ldquo;some forces&rdquo; to give the impression Wetang&rsquo;ula is under siege.&ldquo;Let those doubting Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s popularity be patient and they will know the truth, because the elections are just around the corner,&rdquo; he said.Khalwale said no elder has endorsed Wafula.&ldquo;The Council of Elders in Bungoma has a clear structure of leadership and none of those structures or its leaders have said they support Wafula,&rdquo; he said.Wetang&rsquo;ula has been facing what appears to be growing rebellion in his party after 10 branches in the North Rift endorsed a plan to sack him.Officials said they are collecting signatures to sack Wetang&rsquo;ula at a special National Delegates Conference next month.Last week, Wafula met officials and they resolved to sack Wetang&rsquo;ula for allegedly mismanaging the party. The North Rift branches endorsed Wafula to take over as the interim party leader. A group of elders, led by Maruti Wabomba, also met in Webuye and endorsed Wafula.The North Rift officials who denounced Wetang&rsquo;ula include chairmen Caleb Arusei (Nandi), James Cox (Baringo), John Bunyasi (Uasi Gishu), and Elgeyo Marakwet secretary David Kanda.
