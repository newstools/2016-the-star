Sofapaka did their chances of survival no harm at all as they edged 10-man Muhoroni Youth 2-1 to move out of the bottom table with three matches left to the end of the 2016 in a SportPesa Premier League champaign.The match staged at Ruaraka Stadium last evening saw George Maelo power Batoto Ba Mungu in front with ten minutes played. He took advantage of some lax marking from Muhoroni to head in Noah Abich&rsquo;s free kick before Abich. He added a second from the spot soon after the break after goalkeeper Farouk Shikalo had fouled Paul Odhiambo in the box and was sent off for the offence.Substitute Lwamba Bebeto halved the deficit for the newly crowned KPL Top 8 champions but Sofapaka held on to claim all three points to improve their tally to 19 points. David Ouma&rsquo;s men are now just five points off the safety position occupied by Ushuru while Muhoroni&rsquo;s hopes of defending their recently acquired trophy by finishing in the top half of the 16-team table remains up in the air as they are two shy of the eighth position now occupied by Kakamega Homeboyz.The 2009 champions knew the door was first closing on them to retain their top flight status and they got down to business very first, winning a dangerous free-kick after Yusuf Mohammed had fouled Odhiambo.Dead ball specialist, Noah Abich sent in an inviting cross that Maelo rose to nod home and give Sofapka a dream start. Muhoroni were still bogged by the hangovers from their historic triumph over Gor Mahia and soon had to make a change when Samuel Ndungu limped off to be replaced.That change didn&rsquo;t alter the flow of the game with veteran Jaffer GIchuki and Wycliffe Opondo dominating the midfield for Sofapaka. Their situation got even better in the 50th minute when Odhiambo was upended by Shikalo, who was sent off allowing Abich to dispatch the spot-kick and double Sofapaka&rsquo;s advantage after Tom Juma had sent on reserve keeper Timothy Igweta to replace Benjamin Mosha and take Shikalo&rsquo;s place.Lwamba then got in for Moses Arita and with eight minutes left to play, he won and scored from the spot but Sofapaka clung on to the precious three points. Ushuru, who face Thika United tomorrow will now be looking over their shoulders with trepidation, knowing they could be upstaged at any time as the momentum is with the Batoto Ba Mungu.
