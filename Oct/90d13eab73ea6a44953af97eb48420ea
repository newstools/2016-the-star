Nothing at this juncture in a forgettable campaign will please success-starved AFC Leopards fans more than to see their team derail the ambitions of their arch-rivals Gor Mahia to win a record setting fourth consecutive league title.Leopards have been out of the running for the major honours since they were ousted from the GOtv Shield by Ulinzi Stars and with little to show for another lacklustre season, only sinking Gor&rsquo;s aspirations will bring out schadenfreude experience for Ingwe.It&rsquo;s testament to the job new Leopards coach Stewart Hall has on his hands that the country&rsquo;s second most successful club can only be looking on with envy as their rivals fight out for major honours with them reduced to party poppers.Hall, however, from his previous stint in Kenyan football with Sofapaka, will know the importance of winning this fixture. It&rsquo;s one that has made heroes out of players and coaches alike and should he get the win over Gor tomorrow, he will be the second Leopards coach to win this fixture on his debut following his predecessor Ivan Minnaert.Gor come into this encounter knowing that this is the last chance for them to keep the title race open. Sitting six points behind inform Tusker, only victory will keep their hopes of an unprecedented fourth successive league title alive. All eyes will be on striker Kepha Aswani as he continues with his battle for the golden boot. With 12 goals, Aswani is among three players, who are battling for the top scorers award that comes with Sh500,000 prize at the KPL/SJAK Footballer of the Year Awards.His opposite number Rwandese Jacques Tuyisenge with eight goals from the first leg had also been hoping to win the &lsquo;Golden Boot&rsquo; but a barren run of eleven matches has seen those aspirations nipped in the bud unless he finds his scoring boots starting tomorrow.Also tomorrow, Tusker having already won the GOtv Shield go into the weekend with a feel good factor, knowing victory over relegation threatened Nairobi City Stars will put them on the brink of winning the coveted SportPesa Premier League title that has been K&rsquo;Ogalo&rsquo;s for the last three years. The duel brings with it fond memories because it was against City Stars that the brewers claimed their last league title on the last day of the 2012 season. Third-placed Chemelil sugar also have a keen interest in the title race and that will only continue if they get victory over Posta Rangers on Sunday.
