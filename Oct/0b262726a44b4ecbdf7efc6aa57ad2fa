Lamu residents in areas been worst hit by drought have complained of wild animals roaming around their homes, putting their lives at risk.Villagers of Pandanguo, Chalaluma, Maisha masha, Shee Mgambo, Hindi, Bargoni and Basuba have said they are living in constant fear of being attacked by lions and buffaloes who are storming villages in search of food and water.Residents have appealed to the Kenya Wildlife Service officers in Lamu to contain the animals, saying the deaths caused by the animals will soon be inevitable.The hungry wild animals have hindered movement and schooling since people are scared to venture out of their homes for fear of being attacked. We go very far in search of water and on most occasions we have been coming in direct contact with lions, buffaloes and elephants, said Musaddin Shekuwe of Basuba.
