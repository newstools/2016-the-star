Controversial activist Boniface Mwangi has denied defaming Deputy President William Ruto.In a 36-page defence and counter claim affidavit filed at the High Court Friday, Mwangi says the DP is a public officer, therefore subject to scrutiny.He maintains that the Ruto has been adversely mentioned in the matters that are subject to the suit against him.The DP sued the activist for linking him to the death of businessman Jacob Juma, through a tweet published on September 30.Read: Ruto sues Boniface Mwangi for linking him to Jacob Juma deathJuma who was shot dead on May 6 by unknown people while driving past Lenana School on his way home.In addition, Mwangi claims the Deputy President has been mentioned in other scandals and therefore the argument that his reputation has been tarnished does not hold.In the affidavit, the activist mentions the DP's alleged involvement in corrupt land deals notably those bordering on KCAA land."He publicly admitted that he (Ruto) owns Weston Hotel which is built on public land and is in the flight path to Wilson airport," the court document seen by the Star states."The plaintiff was mentioned in the grabbing of prison land and the processional way from State House to Uhuru Park," Mwangi states.Mwangi also mentions the plaintiff s involvement in the Sh103 million maize scandal unearthed in 2010 by an audit firm.He also averred that his accuser was indicted by ICC for charges of crimes against humanity.The DP's case at the Hague was dropped on grounds that it lacked sufficient evidence, therefore a mistrial."In light of the publications against him, Ruto has failed to live by the standards of conduct demanded of him by the leadership and integrity provisions of the constitution leadership and Integrity Act and Public Officers and Ethics Act," Mwangi states.Mwangi also filed a counter claim against Ruto for comments he made in a local station insinuating that he was a perpetual drunk who wakes up late to nurse a hangover.The activists wants, among other things, the court to declare Ruto unfit to hold public office.More on this: See you in court, Boniface Mwangi tells Ruto on defamation suit
