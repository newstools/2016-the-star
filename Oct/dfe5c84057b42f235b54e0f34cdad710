ODM political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi has lashed out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for feigning helplessness in the fight against corruption. It was in extreme bad taste for the President to single out the Auditor General for tongue-lashing in public, he said. Wandayi went on, As ODM, we are calling on the President to resign before we consider impeaching him. Th eUgunja MP said the buck stops with the President. He said Uhuru is feigning helplessness to hoodwink the public . Everyone one knows that with or without the independent institutions or agencies, the war against corruption can never be won without demonstrated political will, he said. Wandayi said the President has all the intelligence briefing about all mega corruption cases, therefore, he does not need the EACC or the police.
