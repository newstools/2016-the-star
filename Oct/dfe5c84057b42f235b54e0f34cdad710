ODM political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi has lashed out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for feigning helplessness in the fight against corruption.&ldquo;It was in extreme bad taste for the President to single out the Auditor General for tongue-lashing in public,&rdquo; he said. Wandayi went on, &ldquo;As ODM, we are calling on the President to resign before we consider impeaching him.&rdquo; Th eUgunja MP said the buck stops with the President. He said Uhuru is feigning helplessness to &ldquo;hoodwink the public&rdquo;. &ldquo;Everyone one knows that with or without the independent institutions or agencies, the war against corruption can never be won without demonstrated political will,&rdquo; he said. Wandayi said the President has all the intelligence briefing about all mega corruption cases, therefore, he does not need the EACC or the police.
