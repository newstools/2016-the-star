Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he stands the best chance, among Cord co-principals, of beating Jubilee Party.Kalonzo asked co-principals Raila Odinga and Moses Wetang'ula to let him take the lead, owing to his 28-years' experience in public service."I am the best person to send Jubilee home. I have worked with retired Presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki as foreign minister and also in other capacities," he said.Cord is expected to name its presidential candidate in January 2017.Kalonzo expressed hope that Raila and Wetang'ula will back him for his second try at the presidency.The Wiper leader said President Uhuru Kenyatta's JP should be sent home for failing to address problems affecting Kenyans, among them runaway corruption, tribalism, nepotism and insecurity."They have failed to unite Kenyans. The country has 42 nationalities but we are only hearing of two," he said.The Wiper boss addressed a leaders meeting at St Vincent Pastoral Center in Kisii town on Monday when he concluded his two-day tour of Nyamira and Kisii countiesHe also addressed rallies at Kisii Bus Park, Daraja Mbili market and Suneka in Bonchari constituency.Read: Cord to pick flagbearer in JanuaryKalonzo slammed Deputy President William Ruto for using "corruptly" acquired money to woo opposition MPs and supporters."I recently handed over five MPs from Ukambani to Jubilee," he said, but added: "We are not swayed by their move.

Ruto is hurling insults at us when he does not even have a party," he said.Museo likened the Jubilee administration to the apartheid regime in South Africa. "The way South Africans removed the apartheid regime is the same way we should send the Jubilee administration packing," she said.Mbalu said Kalonzo has what it takes to take over the reigns"Kalonzo is clean, God-fearing and experienced. That is all we need to lead this country," she said.Kiala told Kenyans to protect devolution saying Kalonzo believes in the system.Read: Reject Jubilee, Kalonzo says as he woos Kisii voters to Cord As the Wiper leader drummed up support for himself, Raila was in Nyacheki ward campaigning for ODM s candidate in Wednesday s polls.He welcomed lawyer Lumumba Nyaberi, who defected from Jubilee, and will vie for the Kisii governor seat against ODM s James Ongwae."Cord and ODM are now equals in Kisii county.
