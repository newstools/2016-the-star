Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka yesterday told Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula to forget the Cord presidential ticket, because he doesn&rsquo;t have the numbers.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula is a minority in Cord and his Ford Kenya party is more of a regional outfit compared to ODM, which is more established and has networks countrywide. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it. Wetang&rsquo;ula has remote or zero chances of getting the Cord ticket. It is a tall order and it is good to be realistic, rather than cheating ourselves,&rdquo; Lusaka said. ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka are Cord co-principals seeking the ticket to face President Uhuru Kenyatta next year. Lusaka said Raila and Kalonzo have better chances than &ldquo;a man whose party&rsquo;s fortunes are dwindling every other day,&rdquo; thanks to the many defections in the party. &ldquo;How many governors does he have? Those are the indicators. It is painful but the truth must be told. The other day he was busy waving to the trees and birds in Kakamega, because people failed to attend his function,&rdquo; he said. However, Ford Kenya MPs and Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s key allies Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren) and Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini), dismissed Lusaka, saying he does not speak for Cord.&ldquo;Let him concentrate on issues affecting the people of Bungoma and Jubilee where he belongs. He has bigger problems to deal with,&rdquo; Simiyu said.Wamalwa said,&ldquo;Tell him we are coming for his seat.&rdquo;Lusaka said being overambitious is dangerous.
