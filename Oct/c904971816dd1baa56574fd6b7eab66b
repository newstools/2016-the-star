Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation chairperson Christine Otieno has declared her interest in running for governor. She spoke on Thursday during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kisumu. No woman was elected governor in the March 4, 2013, election. &ldquo;It is time for women to come out and take leadership and not just be satisfied with the woman representative position,&rdquo; Otieno said. She added that for the county to develop, women have to prove to the world that they are capable of taking control. The governor contest has attracted Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o and businessman Hezron McObewa.
