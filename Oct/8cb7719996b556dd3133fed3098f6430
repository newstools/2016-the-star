I have struggled to get to where I am. Born from a humble background, I have always been taught to respect everyone, despite their differences. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This is what has kept me going in this industry, and the success I have made is embedded in respect for others. One of my primary school teachers always told us when he were on duty that all of us are human beings, creatures of God s design. We must respect all other human beings. It does not mean I have to agree with their choices or opinions, but indeed, I respect them as human beings.0530HRSI always find myself up at around this time. I take a shower and have breakfast that has been prepared by my wife, Jane. I sometimes make breakfast if I wake up earlier than her. I then head out and open my shop, which acts as a side hustle. I ensure before leaving here that everything is in order.1100HRSI go back home and take my two-ear-old daughter out for a walk. I usually refer to it as a snacking break , as she loves to eat. We get back to the house for lunch then head out to the studio for vocal practice.1400HRSI arrive at Music Empire studio, where I start with creating drops for DJs and get to interact with fellow artistes. I find this very good, as I get to learn more from others and also keep myself abreast of the ongoings in the entertainment industry. This helps in music content creation or generation. A lot of ideas come in at this time.1800HRSI head home, but before I get there, I go to the shop and check on the progress. I spend most of my evenings with my family, where I get to know how they have spent their day. Little Miari, my daughter, gives me lots of stories on the games she has played.WEEKENDSThis is when I have shows. I promote my music to different audiences. When free, I visit my family upcountry, and enjoy moments of happiness together. On Sundays, I respect the Sabbath Day, as stipulated in the Bible. God at the end of the day is the key to life.
