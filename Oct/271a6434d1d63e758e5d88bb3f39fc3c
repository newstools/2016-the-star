Global rating agency Standard &amp; Poor s has reviewed KCB Group s credit outlook to stable from negative, underlining its ability to raise capital at favourable rates. S&amp;P Global has affirmed a B+ long-term and B short-term credit ratings on KCB, saying the stable outlook mirrors a similar action taken on the country s sovereign rating last week. We recently revised the outlook on Kenya to stable from negative, reflecting our view that the sovereign s economic performance and growth prospects will remain strong over 2016-19, S&amp;P said in a statement. We believe KCB is well positioned to maintain its business position and stable financial performance, in part thanks to a more supportive economic environment. The ratings are supported by solid profitability metrics, a strong domestic retail and corporate franchise, strong capital buffers, a well-structured deposit-based funding model and high level of liquid assets. S&amp;P said KCB is best placed to weather the storm of the new operating environment in the Kenya s financial sector following the enactment of a law capping interest rates. KCB Group chief executive Joshua Oigara said the lender s future outlook remained positive riding on increased and deliberate strategic investments in digital solutions.
