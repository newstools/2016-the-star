The Garissa government should fast track the employment of nursery school teachers as the budget estimates have been passed, Dertu MCA Abdi Ali has said.MCAs unanimously passed the 2016-17 Sh7 billion budget estimates two weeks ago, four months after rejecting it.They shot it down in June, arguing that the budget did not adhere to the ceiling adopted by the House in the county fiscal strategy paper 2016 as required by the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.Addressing the press in his ward on Thursday, Ali said the ratio of teachers to ECDE pupils is 1:70.The MCA said the county should also increase ECDE centres and classrooms because more children are being enrolled in nursery school. The facilities and learning and teaching materials should match the enrolment, he said.Ali, who chairs the county assembly Committee on Education, urged the executive to enhance the school feeding programme to retain students in school during the dry spell.He urged the county to provide adequate water in the schools through the water tracking system, as the drought has led to shortage in Garissa.
