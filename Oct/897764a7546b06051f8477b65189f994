High Court judge Abida Aroni has disqualified herself from a murder case against a Bungoma businessman.Aroni cited interference from suspect Joseph Waswa and the victim's family."I know who is trying to reach me. I don t want to mention them but just know you can t reach me," Aroni told a packed court in Bungoma on Monday.She asked the parties in the matter to let justice prevail, saying the case is emotive int he region.Abida directed the transfer of the case to the Kakamega High Court but said it was not clear whether further interference would be reported.Waswa was accused of shooting and killing Mitch Kibiti, a student at Technical University of Mombasa, in July 2014.Justice Alfred Mabea was the first to disqualify himself from the matter citing pressure from various quarters.The case against the accused, who has declared interest in the Bungoma senator seat, will be mentioned on January 26.Waswa made an application at the Court of Appeal in Kisumu for the case stopped until their complaint is determined.He wants the appellate court to rule on whether Kibiti's family lawyer George Murunga should be allowed to cross examine witnesses.
