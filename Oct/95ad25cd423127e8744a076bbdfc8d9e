The Kiambu government plans to move a stage on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Kimende, Lari subcounty, to reduce accidents. Subcounty administrator Michael Mutuku said every month, several cases of people being hit by vehicles are reported. He said residents have tried to erect bumps on the highway. Mutuku said the road is maintained and managed by the Kenya National Highways Authority so the county cannot re-design, put up a stage or bumps to reduce cases of people being hit by vehicles while crossing the highway. Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kimende High School on Thursday, he said public service vehicles picking up and dropping passengers will have to divert from the highway into the bus park. &ldquo;We are considering moving the stage from the highway to our bus park, which is next to the highway. Our aim is to remove the passengers from the highway and reduce accidents,&rdquo; Mutuku said.
