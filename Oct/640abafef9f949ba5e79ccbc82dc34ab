Marsabit county will invest heavily in tourism and trade upon the completion of the 500km Trans-Africa highway, which will connect Nairobi to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Speaking yesterday in Merille, Governor Ukur Yatani said the highway will open the county to trade.Marsabit has been unable to tap into its tourism potential and other economic activities, such as livestock trade, due to inaccessible roads, he said. Tourism is one of the biggest revenue generators of the national government and with no doubt Marsabit is also set to reap the same fruits, Yatani said.The road had been delayed due to animal attacks, heavy rain and harsh terrain, but the contractors says it will be completed by December.
