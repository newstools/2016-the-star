Labour party leader Ababu Namwamba has announced that they will declare their preferred presidential candidate before the end of the year.He said that the relaunched LPK, during its national delegates conference later this year, will not necessarily endorse a candidate fronted by Cord or Jubilee.Namwamba said they are yet to decide whether to front their own candidate."Our aim is to identify a person whose ideology is issue-based and one who will deal with matters affecting Kenyans like historical injustices," he said on Saturday.Read: Third force party will not join Jubilee, Ababu says The Budalang'i MP said it must not be dismissed that he also fits the bill to steer the country to greater heights."If delegates feel that am the right person, then who am I to disagree.
