Labour party leader Ababu Namwamba has announced that they will declare their preferred presidential candidate before the end of the year.He said that the relaunched LPK, during its national delegates conference later this year, will not necessarily endorse a candidate fronted by Cord or Jubilee.Namwamba said they are yet to decide whether to front their own candidate."Our aim is to identify a person whose ideology is issue-based and one who will deal with matters affecting Kenyans like historical injustices," he said on Saturday.Read: Third force party will not join Jubilee, Ababu says The Budalang'i MP said it must not be dismissed that he also fits the bill to steer the country to greater heights."If delegates feel that am the right person, then who am I to disagree. But just know we are consulting widely before backing or fronting our own presidential candidate," he said.Namwamba made the comments when he spoke to journalists at Moi International Airport, Mombasa.LPK's announcement comes barely a day after Amani National Congress consented that Musalia Mudavadi engages Cord towards creation of a super alliance.The National Super Alliance (NASA) is likely to bring together Raila Odinga's ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Ford-Kenya as well as Kanu, ANC and Narc-K.Read: Mudavadi, Raila, Gideon kick off 2017 alliance talks The group intends to field a single presidential candidates to fight it out with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto's Jubilee Party.Namwamba said he is not opposed to the formation of the super alliance, saying that every political leader and party is at liberty to engage in conversations that are in the best interest of the country."People are expressing their views on various political formations and that is democracy. We believe in the existing political conversation in western Kenya," he said.Ababu said something major will happen towards ending the stalemate of who should be fronted as the face of the Luhya community in national politics."We need politics that are in the best interest of the nation,' he said, further advising leaders against brewing divisions among citizens.
