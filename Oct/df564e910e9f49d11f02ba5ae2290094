Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga will name a tarmac road under construction after himself because he is a hero, he says.Another will be named after Fidel Odinga, the deceased son of Cord leader Raila Odinga, he added.&ldquo;I have done a lot. Is naming one of the roads leading to my office after myself a problem?&rdquo; Rasanga asked.He spoke on Thursday at the Siaya County Stadium during the Mashujaa Day celebrations that were boycotted by all the six elected MPs from the region, including Senator James Orengo.The celebrations in Siaya were attended by three MCAs from Alego who are pro-Rasanga, as other ward representatives gave them a wide berth.Former Gem MP Joe Donde, who is also the Siaya Public Service Board chairman, attended the function.Rasanga added that upon completion of specific tarmacked roads, they intend to name two after Austin Omwombo and Churchill Odhiambo, who were shot dead by police during the May 23 anti-IEBC demonstrations.He said this will honour them for their bravery in fighting for the exit of the embattled IEBC commissioners.Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango sparked off the debate, saying Rasanga should have been installed a hero because he is the first governor of the county.&ldquo;You cannot write the history of Siaya county without mentioning Rasanga as the first governor of Siaya,&rdquo; Onyango added, to the bewilderment of the few residents who attended the celebrations.The deputy governor took a swipe at President Uhuru Kenyatta for not honouring the doyen of opposition politics, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, and Cord leader Raila Odinga in his speech in Machakos on Thursday.Uhuru attended national celebration of Mashujaa Day in Machakos.Onyango said history cannot be written without recognising Jaramogi and Raila, who fought for the first and second liberations of Kenya.He said Raila stands tall as a nationalist who has advocated equality, including resource allocation to all Kenyans, and should be recognised as a hero.The deputy governor said he and Rasanga will defend their reelection bid based on the projects they have initiated and not mere rhetoric and political infighting.
