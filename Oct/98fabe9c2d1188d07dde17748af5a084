Where shall we get them? he asked.Uhuru said the SGR will have no adverse effects on the Nairobi National Park, contrary to claims being made. All that you are hearing ni upuzi [is silly]. There is nothing like that. Let them stop going to court and inciting locals, he said.The Nairobi-Naivasha section is 120km long, Naivasha-Kisumu is 250km and Kisumu-Malaba 118km.The President also held a two-hour meeting with those working on the project.
