Bethel Church of God and Bethel Church congregants of the two groups traded barbs on Sunday.Bethel Church members came from Ruiru and Nembu, Gatundu South, and stormed Bethel Church of God, Juja subcounty. The 10 members said they own the church and they will reclaim it.They disrupted the service and demanded to conduct Mass. I came in the morning and found two vehicles in the compound. When I got in, I found strange people had occupied the altar, Pastor Stephen Churu said.He said he confronted them. I politely told them to move from the altar and join other believers but they said they have taken over, Churu said.Members of Bethel Church of God then turned rowdy and kicked out the strangers. There is no way we would have allowed them to disrespect the church, Esther Wanjiku said. The church was closed pending investigation.
