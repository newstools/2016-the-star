The ODM party has suspended Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang&rsquo;wara for what it termed &ldquo;gross misconduct and violation of the party constitution&rdquo;.This is after he sponsored a motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero. The announcement was made yesterday by Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa at a Nairobi hotel. He said Nyang&rsquo;wara has joined the Jubilee Party and he is not entitled to transact any business on behalf of ODM.&ldquo;His recent action to impeach our governor has not been taken lightly. We have no option but to suspend him indefinitely from the party. Such uncalled for behaviour will not be tolerated,&rdquo; he said.Last Thursday, Nyang&rsquo;wara was beaten by MCAs at the assembly who termed him &ldquo;a traitor&rdquo;. Nyangwara wanted Kidero impeached, because of the suspicious deals he approved, including a revenue collection contract with JamboPay and an agreement with Chinese car-maker Forton to supply garbage trucks.
