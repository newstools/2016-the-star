First Lady Margaret Kenyatta yesterday presided over the launch of the Beth Mugo Cancer Foundation at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi. Nominated Senator Beth Mugo was present. The event was attended by other cancer survivors in celebrating successes in the war on cancer. “Today, we come together to play our part in changing the narrative around cancer, which, too often and for too long, has been defined by fear, impotence, despair and, at worst, death,” Kenyatta said. “We are here to prove that the narrative is categorically false.” She said the testimonies heard at the ceremony were stories of personal struggle and profound triumph that encourage and remind people that cancer does not have to be an end. “They are reminders that there is life and new beginnings and of the benefits of early detection. They are reminders that when faced with tremendous challenges, we must accept our reality, face it head on, and embrace the support of our closest allies in our personal war — friends and family,” Kenyatta said.
