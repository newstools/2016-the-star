Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi has urged teachers in Meru county to register as members of the Jubilee Party.He said teachers too have a constitutional right to belong a party of their choice.Linturi spoke when he attended the Imarika Promotion Draw organised by Solutions Sacco.&ldquo;I want to recruit you into my party &ndash; Jubilee. Next month we are starting recruitment of the Jubilee Party members,&rdquo; he said.Linturi dismissed Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s programme of constructing ECDE classes, saying the cost of constructing the classes is high and unrealistic.He urged the teachers and schools' boards of management to distance themselves from the projects.Linturi said if they receive the Sh1.2 million to construct the classes, they will not be honest to themselves and residents. He said the average cost of constructing a classroom is Sh550,000.&ldquo;If you are building a class for Sh1.2 million, it will be exorbitant and you are doing wrong. If the governor is lying that you are receiving the money to supervise the construction, then you have a responsibility of calling your parents and say that you don&rsquo;t know how much was used in building the classrooms,&rdquo; he said.Linturi is eyeing the Meru Senate seat.
