Saboti MP David Wafula has said he will defend his seat on the Jubilee Party ticket. Speaking in Kitale Stadium during a funds drive, he said he is optimistic about winning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt my support or regret joining JP. I researched before making a firm decision to remain in the party after New Ford Kenya was dissolved,&rdquo; Wafula said.The MP will face his 2013 closest rivals, Jonus Kuko and Philip Makete, during the JP primaries. Others who have shown their interest in the seat include educationist Joseph Pepela, cleric Robert Makona, former Trans Nzoia Finance executive Ken Simiyu, security officer William Nangulu, businessman Caleb Amisi, teacher Philip Makete, Lawrence Mokusu and businessman Wafula Mutacho.
