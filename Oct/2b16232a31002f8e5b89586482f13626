Regardless of the outcome of this afternoon&rsquo;s GOtv Shield final, history is bound to be made when giants Tusker and Ulinzi Stars go head to head at Nyayo National Stadium.Tusker coach Paul Nkata will be seeking to be the first foreign coach to lead the brewers to the cup, formerly known as the Moi Golden Cup and then the President&rsquo;s Cup while Ulinzi will be looking for their maiden triumph in the sixty-year-old competition.Tusker, the three-time winners are in the final for the first time since 2005, where they were beaten 2-1 by the then World Hope, now re-branded as Nairobi City Stars while Ulinzi are in the final for the first time since 1995 when they went down 2-0 to the now defunct Rivatex.The brewers have not lifted the trophy since their victory in 1993 and will be hoping that winning the shield will be the beginning of what would be historic season even by the brewers lofty standards. Nkata&rsquo;s men are still firm favourites to clinch the top flight league title as they enjoy a sizeable lead going into the final month of the campaign.As usual, the Ugandan tactician will name his strongest available side with striker Allan Wanga set to be paired up-front with Noah Wafula, scorer of the winning goal in their semi-final victory over KCB.To get a chance of winning their maiden cup, Ulinzi will have to put the shackles on the brewers creative force Humphrey Mieno. The lanky play-maker has been enjoying a renaissance of sorts recently and will be crucial to Tusker&rsquo;s aspirations heading towards the pivotal stage of the season.Ulinzi themselves carry a formidable threat in the shape of lethal striker John Makwata. With his three goals, Makwata is the joint leading scorer in the competition. The international forward grabbed a sensational hat-trick in their 4-1 rout of Kariobangi Sharks and having been rested for the first 45 minutes in their league stalemate with AFC Leopards last week, he will be fresh and ready for this afternoon&rsquo;s duel. Losers in the semis Kariobangi Sharks and KCB will curtain raise the big clash at the same venue from 11am this morning and soon after, there will be an exhibition game between a select FKF team and Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) from 9am.The winner of the today&rsquo;s tie will carry home a winner&rsquo;s purse of Sh2 million from sponsors GOtv .
