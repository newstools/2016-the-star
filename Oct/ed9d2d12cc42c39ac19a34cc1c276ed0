Jubilee Party has urged the Makonde people of Kwale and Kilifi counties to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2017 poll.The plea comes in the wake of the state&#39;s efforts to accord the community their right to be registered as citizens by issuing them with IDs.Makonde community chairman Thomas Nguli said their population numbers between 10,000 and 15,000 people.He said those from Mozambique, Tanzania and Rwanda will have received their IDs by November 10. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, who launched the registration, said on Tuesday that their votes should go to Jubilee. &quot;You must be patriotic and loyal to your country now that you are becoming Kenyan citizens,&quot; Nkaissery said at Mvindeni Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Msambweni. &quot;Our officers will be in Kwale for 15 days and three days in Kilifi to register other stateless people,&quot; the CS said.

Why didn&rsquo;t they solve the land issues? If it is I who grabbed land, they should tell people instead of inciting them,&quot; Nkaissery said.
