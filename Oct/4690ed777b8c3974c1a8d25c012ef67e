We will lead women to march naked in the streets if women s representation in the National Assembly is scrapped, Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau has said.She was reacting to a report by the Auditor General that said Kenyans are overrepresented by exorbitantly paid lawmakers and the number of elected leaders should be slashed and their allowances reduced. I am aware the 47 woman representatives will be most targeted. We will strip naked; we will mobilise women and march in the streets, Mwau said.She spoke on Wednesday in Malili, Makueni county, during a workshop for educating women on their role in society.Mwau said the Constitution protects women against discrimination. She said women will protect the positions created for them by law.The Deputy Governor said the current Parliament is unconstitutional since it does not have one third women s representation as envisaged in the Constitution. We want more women in Parliament to make it constitutional, she said.
