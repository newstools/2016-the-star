Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has demanded that President Uhuru Kenyatta account for benefits Kenya has received after his many missions abroad.Mudavadi said the constitution demands that a report on the excursions be presented to Parliament but said this has not been done."At the risk of being nicknamed 'the travelling president', Uhuru has been leading huge foreign delegations where trade agreements are signed," he noted in a statement on Monday."Since Kenya embarked on economic diplomacy, Kenyan government trade delegations have been pouring into foreign capitals with private businessmen accompanying the President."But he observed that the final outcome and beneficiaries of the agreements are never revealed.Read: I have been labelled the 'tourist', Uhuru tells Rio athletesMudavadi urged the government to be transparent about the individual businesses that have benefited.&ldquo;At whose benefit were they ensuing agreements? The government has decided it is better to keep the lid on it. Kenyans have a right to know who is benefiting at their expense," he said."Otherwise we may be creating a business oligarchy the Russian way, with disastrous consequences to our economy in the near future."The President has made numerous foreign trips that have earned him the tourist tag especially among Kenyans on social media.State House has defended the trips saying they are good for the Kenyan economy and development. They said they have brought Sh10 trillion in foreign investments in the form of loans, grants and foreign direct investment for the past three years.
