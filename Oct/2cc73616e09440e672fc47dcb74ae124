A new variety of commercial button mushroom spawn has been introduced by JKUAT.Research scientist Patrick Muchiri (pictured) said the variety grows best in warm and hot weather. He works at the university&rsquo;s Institute of Biotechnology Research. &ldquo;I have for the past two years researched on various soils and found that the months of October and March are ideal for growing this particular mushroom spawn variety because most parts of the country are usually warm,&rdquo; Muchiri said on Saturday.He singled out Mombasa, Kisumu and the Northern parts of Kenya as being ideal places for the plant&rsquo;s growth.Muchiri said the new variety has a superior taste compared to other mushrooms.He said it is resistant to fungal, bacterial and viral mushroom diseases.&ldquo;The new variety has better handling characteristics as it has a longer shelf life and is therefore suitable for small-scale farmers who do not have good facilities for preservation,&rdquo; Muchiri said.The commercial button mushroom spawn is now readily available at the university&rsquo;s Research, Production and Extension Unit. Other types of mushroom spawn available at the university&rsquo;s laboratories include shiitaki and reishi, both of which are grown for medicinal purposes. Last week, Tropikal Brands Africa signed a deal to commercialise yoghurt produced by the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
