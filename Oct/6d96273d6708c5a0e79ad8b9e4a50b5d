The newly formed Kenya Rugby Union second tier Kenya Cup league kicking off on November 5 will be used as a transition into the Kenya Cup season proper. The 12-team league was adopted by KRU to accommodate the regional finalists of the concluded Nationwide league and will run concurrently with the Kenya Cup and Eric Shirley Shield that starts on November 5. The league has adopted the conference format comprising of two conferences, the Eastern and Western Conference. The bottom two teams in the Kenya Cup season, Bungoma Sharks and Thika RFC were relegated to the second-tier league. Nationwide league champions USIU failed to earn promotion last season despite their impressive performance. They have been pitted in the Eastern Conference alongside Kisii RFC, Bungoma Sharks, University of Eldoret and Kisumu RFC. The Western Conference in the other hand has pitted JKUAT, Mombasa RFC, South Coast Pirates, Catholic University, Thika RFC and Kenya Methodist Universityâ€™s Pit Bulls. Thika will host Kenya Methodist University in the Thika Stadium at 4.00pm as Bungoma play Kisumu at Mamboleo Showground in the second match at 4.00pm. Catholic University Monks will host Coastal based side South Coast Pirates in the third match of the day as USIU host Kisii RFC. JKUAT will play former Kenya Cup side Mombasa at JKUAT grounds while Moi University play against University of Eldoret in a repeat of National Wide Rift Valley region final. The second round will take place a week later on October 29 and will also feature six matches. The top two teams will get promoted to the Kenya Cup league replacing the bottom two teams in the senior league.
