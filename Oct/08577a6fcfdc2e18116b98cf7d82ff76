The Kenya Revenue Authority is leveraging on the newly launched five-year Information Communication Technology strategy to tap into the informal sector in bid to widen taxation base.The taxman said it will use analytics on filed returns and avail its services on the mobile platform as part of the strategy to access information and ease the tax returns filing procedures. &ldquo;Application of analytics for tax purposes is an initiative which is already underway. We are doing implementation right now, and we expect to start rolling that before June next year,&rdquo; KRA deputy commissioner for support services Ezekiel Saina said.The analytical strategy will include tax audits on businesses and examining companies&rsquo; general ledger system data, retrieved using a direct data connection. &ldquo;Some of the reasons some have not come on board is because of difficulties in accessing the services, lack of information, and some of the initiatives under this strategy are actually to make sure we have got information available to the taxpayers,&rdquo; he said.
