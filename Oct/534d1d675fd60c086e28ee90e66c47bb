Members of the stateless Makonde community heading to Nairobi to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta were detained on Tuesday for two and a half hours at the Voi police station.Police were said to have been acting on &ldquo;orders from above&rdquo;. The people said it was yet another attempt by Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa to keep them from reaching State House, Nairobi.Marwa&rsquo;s effort to block them in Kwale on Monday failed, as the more than 1,000 people left peacefully.Kenya Human Rights Commission manager Diana Gichengo said the representatives of the national government at the Coast have not been honest with the stateless people in their quest to get citizenship. &ldquo;From what we have encountered, government representatives are the hurdles, as they are asleep on the jobs,&rdquo; she said on the phone.The stateless community includes the Makonde from Mozambique, Tanzania&rsquo;s Wapemba, Rwandese, Burundians and Nubians from Sudan. Gichengo said the people have not broken any law by trekking to Nairobi, but are exercising their right.
