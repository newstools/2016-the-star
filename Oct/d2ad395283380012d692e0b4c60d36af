In yesterday&rsquo;s Corridors of Power, we indicated that Deputy President William Ruto (pictured) has left President Uhuru Kenyatta to woo the Maa community alone. The item insinuated that the DP had missed several functions in the area that were attended by the President. What we failed to mention was that the DP was sent to Zambia by the President during William ole Ntimama&rsquo;s burial and was at the UN General Assembly during Geothermal Development Company MD Johnson ole Nchoe&rsquo;s homecoming.********** A top Jubilee politician said to enjoy protection from the powers-that-be is on the spot after it emerged that he reportedly participated in the award of the Sh15 billion teachers&rsquo; medical cover. The politician has been in total panic mode after a constitutional activist moved to court to challenge the award of the tender to AON Minet, citing irregularities and the integrity of the tender. With fears that details of the top Jubilee politician&rsquo;s intervention in the process could be laid bare in court, the influential and flamboyant politician has been moving from one office to another trying to seek help. Two commissioners at the Teacher&rsquo;s Service Commission have reportedly raised concerns over the handling of a whistle-blower who was allegedly fired for raising issues on the tender.***********An opposition lawmaker from Northern Kenya is in panic over the government&rsquo;s relief food distribution strategy. The MP, who was not among the leaders from the region endorsed by elders to defend his seat, yesterday resorted to the media, accusing a senior Jubilee politician of scheming to send him home in the 2017 polls. Corridors has been informed that the senior Jubilee politician has given the opposition lawmaker sleepless nights in the last few weeks, after the government scaled up relief food distribution in his constituency. The MP alleges that Jubilee is dangling relief food to endear itself to starving locals, but residents are said to have questioned his management of the Constituency Development Fund kitty to alleviate biting hunger.***********Just why has the ambitious Sh300 billion Public-Private partnership housing project failed to kick off at City Hall, more than a year after the contracts were awarded? Corridors is informed that the red tape in the Lands Office, where there is keen interest in kickbacks and favours against the law, has caused delay in processing provisional title deeds and extension-of-lease approvals. The city county government is now planning to go to the highest office in the land to get the Lands Office into action to unlock the commencement of the mega project.
