The state and county should provide an alternative route for Mihango and Kayole residents, since the KDF cut their main link road to secure its land, two Nairobi leaders have said.They are Embakasi East MP John Omondi and Mihango MCA Paul Kados. They called the blockage unfair and barbaric. At the weekend, armed soldiers guarded the bulldozer that dug a trench across the road. Residents were told to seek alternative routes.Residents said the KDF told them that this week it will also demolish the only bridge. They said they have used the road since 1999, and the cut-off is unfair.They protested last Friday and on Monday. Kados was arrested during the Monday protest. The Friday protest began at 6am. There has never been a problem between us and the soldiers. We were surprised to wake one morning and find the road had been blocked, a resident said. Kados was charged at Makadara court and released on Sh300,000 bail. Omondi told the Star cutting off the road will strandthousands of residents. This is a serious matter, not a joke. The Nairobi government and the state should come up with an alternative route to stop the suffering, he said.Residents are forced to use the Manyanja Road and other routes. Schoolchildren who live on either side cannot access schools. They now get to school at 10am, Kados said. The Kenya Defence Forces should have alerted residents so they could prepare and the local authorities seek alternative routes. He said the Nairobi Master Plan of 1980 shows thatathe road, which passes through a section of the KDF land, was to link to the Eastern bypass. This is something that had been envisioned for the future. The KDF should allow residents to use the road, Kados said. The KDF is yet to issue a statement on the matter.
