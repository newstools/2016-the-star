A fundraiser for Thika jua kali artisans who lost their property in a fire last week almost turned chaotic as supporters of rival politicians clashed on Saturday. The rivals exchanged blows and roughed up each other. One group supported Thika Town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a while the other backed her rival Patrick Wainaina. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s supporters attacked three men distributing caps and T-shirts with Wainaina&rsquo;s portrait at the function convened by the MP. &ldquo;We were giving out our items, just like Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s supporters. I don&rsquo;t understand why they beat us up. But we are sure they were acting on orders,&rdquo; Lewis Ngaruiya said. &ldquo;We were there rightfully as Thika residents. It didn&rsquo;t mean that all those present were Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s supporters.&rdquo; Martin Kiruki, a supporter of the MP, accused Wainaina&rsquo;s team of storming the event to cause chaos. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a warned her rivals that she won&rsquo;t be cowed by their intimidation.
