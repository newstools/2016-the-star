Mwingi deputy county commissioner David Rotich has warned offi cials in charge of relief food against selling it.More than 10,000 families in the area face starvation. Speaking at Kiomo on Saturday, Rotich said the national government will ensure the situation does not get out of control.Last week, 100 bags of maize, 150 of rice, 50 of beans and 10 cartons of oil were distributed. Rotich said the number of affected families is higher than the amount of the food dispatched. I urge the government to release more food to save the situation, he said.
