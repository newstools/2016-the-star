Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has threatened to sue the Dominion Company for going against a deal and growing sugarcane in Yala Swamp. He said the company took advantage of the transition to devolution to cultivate sugarcane without consulting his office. Dominion started farming sugarcane a few days after I was sworn in and they never bothered to consult the county government, knowing very well that the MoU never talked of sugarcane, Rasanga said.He spoke on Wednesday at Ratuoro, a few metres from the company s gate. Rasanga commissioned a survey to identify the land the company is supposed to occupy. He said Dominion must stop farming sugarcane. The governor had been accused of leasing 6,000 hectares (14,826 acres) of Yala Swamp to the Godavari Company but stopped the process to pave way for a survey.
