Kenya&rsquo;s political risk guarantee from regional insurer African Trade Insurance is set to reduce on dilution of its stake from 15 to 10 per cent.This is after the entry of Ethiopia and Zimbabwe which have taken a combined five per cent stake after a year-long process with funding from the African Development Bank, ATI chief executive George Otieno said in Nairobi yesterday.&ldquo;We expect the risk exposure from Kenya to come down significantly,&rdquo; he said. ATI was formed in 2001 by 10 East and Central African States as a multilateral insurer of commercial and political risk.
