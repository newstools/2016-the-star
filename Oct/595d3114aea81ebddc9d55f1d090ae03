Cord leader leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s foray into the Jubilee strongholds has generated unease among residents in the South Rift.A section of Kipsigis elders on Monday held a three-hour closed-door meeting with Raila, who was accompanied by Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, on the outskirts of Kericho township.The agenda of the meeting was reportedly the Sh38 billion Itare Dam project which has sparked controversy in Bomet, parts of Nakuru and Narok counties.Although the details of the meeting are scant, Raila is being seen to take advantage of the topical issues raised by locals to woo voters.&ldquo;Raila wants to position himself as a saviour to be seen as solving issues affecting residents in the Jubilee-dominated zones,&rdquo; Peter Kerich, a Kuresoi resident, said.The Council of Kipsigis Elders&rsquo; chairman Isaiah Cheluget said they were forced to reach out to Raila after Jubilee failed to convince them the project would not cause ecological problems. The project, funded by the Italian government, has been marred by disputes following claims there was no public participation.Analysts say the controversial project has divided the Kipsigis community, as the opposition chief aims to capitalise on Jubilee&rsquo;s weaknesses in its strongholds.The elders maintained the project will divert water from the Mau Forest complex, resulting in the Chemosit, Kipsonoi, Ndoinet and Sondu rivers drying up.
