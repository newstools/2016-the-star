President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday called for dialogue to weed out corruption and address tribal conflicts.Through State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu, the president asked Kenyans to take advantage of the available dialogue platforms to address corruption.He said the government was frank to protect public resources as well as offer competent services in the private sector."Dialogue has a premium place in this administration and we are pleased that the last State House corruption and governance summit was successful," Esipisu said in his weekly briefing.He said Kenya was on the right in the fight against corruption going by the latest reports from the IMF, World and the United Nations, "which have described the nation as the best investment destination"."The administration is also pushing dialogue to promote peace and ensure warring communities live in harmony, and are united since 'Uwazi' is one of the pillars of the Jubilee administration," the spokesperson said.He added that the President has always taken up security to safeguard people&rsquo;s lives and property.Read: Break your silence on bandit attacks at Kerio Valley, Raila tells Uhuru "The leaders of the warring communities should always engage dialogue on issues affecting them to save lives and stop destruction of properties," Esipisu said.He also announced that the President will leave the country on Wednesday to attend the Oversight for peace and security cooperation in Africa summit held in Angola."The President, together with other EAC nations will first demand that all groups in Burundi and South Sudan are brought on board as well as warring groups down their tools in the newest nation," Esipisu said.He said the summit is also meant to stop the atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo to ensure the region remains stable."The atrocities continue being perpetrated and the matter is urgent. The region is vital to the stability and security of the continent and should be addressed fast," he said.Esipisu further indicated that the President will also capitalise on the summit to lobby for Kenya&rsquo;s bid for the top post at the African Union.This is in the wake of the nomination of Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohammed for the post of AU commission chair."We will have many heads of states and it will be a good platform to solidify our support since we want the support from all nations," he said.Read: African leaders receptive to Amina's candidature for AU top post "I can assure you that the President called and talked to President John Maghufuli of Tanzanian to lobby for the Foreign Affairs CS since Tanzania has not presented their candidates after they promised," Esipisu said.
