Residents of Utawala barricaded the Eastern bypass on Friday to protest a move by KDF of closing Mihango and Kayole road.They claimed that the road was closed without notice as they only woke up to the sight of caterpillars digging sections of the road.Business through the route was paralysed as matatu drivers plying the road were forced to cut short their business of the day.KDF is yet to issue a statement on the reasons behind the closure of the road, which is said to be passing through their land.The road which links Mihango and Kayole was established in 1999 as the only link between the two villages."There has never been a problem between us and the soldiers. We were surprised to wake this morning to find the road had been blocked," they said.The residents of the two areas are now forced to either use Manyanja road or Kagundo road to access their homes.Area MP John Omondi said the destruction of the road was in bad faith and would trigger animosity between the residents and the uniformed men.Omondi said at least residents should have been briefed on the changes so that they could plan on alternative routes instead of such inconveniences."I have talked to the military chief and the county government to intervene. They have agreed to look into the matter," he said.
