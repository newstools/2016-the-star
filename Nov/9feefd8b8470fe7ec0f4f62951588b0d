Album: Introverted IntuitionArtiste: SkiiiwalkerGenre: Hip HopRelease: October 18TDE is indeed the biggest hip-hop recording label in the game right now. Lance Skiiiwalker's debut album, Introverted Intuition, proves the label produces big artistes who do not subscribe to conventional ways of creating music. Essential songs on the 13- track album include Forbidden Fruit, Stockholm, Sound, All Stops, Advantage and Lovers Lane. Guest appearances include Michael Anthony and Schoolboy Q. The project is a compilation of experimental music with a very unique touch. It might not be best record produced, but we can't deny it is a good attempt.Star Rating: 3.5 out of 5
