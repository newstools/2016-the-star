Kiambu majority leader Patrick Chege, who caused a commotion in the assembly on Tuesday, will be investigated by the county. Speaker Gathii Irungu yesterday said he ordered a probe into Chege s behavior. On Tuesday, MCAs said |Chege was out of control, ranting incoherently against Governor William Kabogo. The MCA, said to be suffering from emotional issues, last week walked three kilometres from Ruiru Prison to Ruiru town in the middle of the night. He went to the Ruiru police station and slept there, claiming his life was in danger. The Gitothua MCA is said to have started behaving strangely after his wife s death in early 2014. At one point, women MCAs complained he threatened to rape them, forcing them to seek security. The majority leader does not have mental illness. He may be depressed. Branding him mentally ill is a ploy to silence him, Sigona ward MCA Hudson Mutonya said.Speaker Irungu yesterday said, Some MCAs stood on a point of order, saying the majority leader was threatening them. Others claimed they were being sexually harassed. Although the incidents did not occur within assembly precincts, I ordered an investigation, Irungu said.In September, Chege was reported missing. He had been admitted at Nairobi s Avenue Hospital. On returning, he told the assembly that men and a police officer kidnapped him after injecting him with a sedative. Chege said when he regained consciousness, he found himself in a hospital. He said he feared for his life and sought refuge at the Ruiru Catholic Church after leaving hospital. I stayed with the parish priest, Chege said.He was elected majority leader in October 2014 after Ndarugo MCA Simon Komu was axed. Chege was a staunch Kabogo supporter, but they fell out. Chege is now Kabogo s fierce critic and he posts online about alleged country graft. In April last year, Ikinu ward MCA Ann Njuruba presented a petition to Irungu, seeking his removal, saying Chege was unable to conduct house business . It was dismissed.
