Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru is expected to face the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly over the Sh1.6 billion million NYS scam.Waiguru was asked to face the MPs after former Devolution PS Peter Mangiti and businesswoman Josephine Kabura adversely mentioned her in the scandal.Though Waiguru has maintained her innocence saying she was a whistleblower, Mangiti told the committee on Wednesday that Waiguru 'illegally' asked for Sh3.5 billion.The money, according to the sacked PS, was to pay companies associated with Kabura, who also implicated the former CS in the scandal through a sworn affidavit.Waiguru will be the last witness to appear before the watchdog committee chaired by Rarieda MP Nicolas Gumbo.The meeting was scheduled to give the ex-CS a fair chance to clear her name on the claims by Mangiti.Mangiti told the probe team that Waiguru used supplementary budgets to get more money even without NYS making requests for the cash.Though Kabura admitted to receiving Sh1.6 billion from NYS, she is yet to produce documents to show how she spent the millions.Read: 10 Kabura revelations that shocked Kenya during NYS scam probe Waiguru, while appearing before the committee early this year, blamed her woes on cartels in government.She said the group pushed her out of her job for the sole reason of wanting to benefit from the NYS money.Waiguru has maintained that her role as a CS does not allow her to approve payments since only the PS has authority to incur expenditure (EIA).Read: Waiguru links Duale, Farouk, Murkomen to NYS
