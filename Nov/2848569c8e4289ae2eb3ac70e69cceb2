President Vladimir Putin has signed an executive order to have Russia withdraw its signature from the International Criminal Court.This comes amid calls for his military to be referred to ICC over air strikes backing President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.Putin instructed Russia's foreign ministry to notify the United Nations of the country's refusal to be subject to the body's activity on Wednesday, following the same move by Gambia, South Africa and Burundi.State media reported that the government was pulling out of the 2002 Rome Statute, which establishes the International Criminal Court's status and powers, although the Kremlin never ratified the agreement it signed in 2000. The International Criminal Court has not justified hopes placed upon it and did not become a truly independent and authoritative judicial body, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry said.A statement claimed that Russia "consistently advocates that people guilty of grave offences must be held accountable" and took part in developing laws against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.Francois Hollande, the President of France, called suggested that Russia should face war crimes charges over its bombardment of rebel-held eastern Aleppo last month. These are people who today are the victims of war crimes, he told French television amid hundreds of reported civilian deaths. Those that commit these acts will have to face up to their responsibility, including in the ICC. Both Russian and Syria have denied deliberately killing civilians or breaking international law in the Syrian civil war, saying they are targeting terrorist groups.
