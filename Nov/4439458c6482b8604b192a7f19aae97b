ODM leader Raila Odinga has denied that Pan Paper mills in Webuye collapsed under the grand coalition government.Raila accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of rejecting the proposal to revive the factory when he served as Finance minister in the government.He said the Jubilee administration sold the mill at a throwaway price to Rai Group of Companies, to "benefit Uhuru", yet the factory was worth more than Sh10 billion."When he says he wants to revive Pan Paper, he wants it to run as he makes profits," said the opposition leader.He added that the sugar industry requires a lasting solution, not the "piecemeal approach" Jubilee has taken.Read: Uhuru to open phase one of Webuye Pan Paper Mills in DecemberAlso read: Uhuru gives cash-strapped Mumias Sugar another Sh1 billionRaila addressed the first ever Western region ODM delegates conference in Kakamega on Friday.The event was held a day after Uhuru presided over a graduation ceremony at Kibabii University in Bungoma.Uhuru said Raila's criticisms of the Jubilee administration were not genuine.He said Raila failed to revive Pan Paper during his tenure as Prime Minister, yet he was criticising Jubilee's efforts to revamp it.But Raila said Jubilee is desperate and trying to tarnish his name by claiming he is benefiting from county government funds.He said the rounds he was making across the country were part of the home stretch for the 2017 general elections."It is going to be a titanic battle to save Kenyans against the forces of the status quo. Jubilee has amassed all the wealth to help them fight opposition," he said.He said he will only keep quiet when Kenya wins the war against corruption.Also read: Cord governors deny 'sponsoring' Raila trips, rallies with county fundsThe conference brought together delegates from Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma, Vihiga and Trans Nzoia counties.They endorsed Raila as the party's sole presidential candidate for the 2017 poll and asked him to consult Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on any negotiations.Among those who attended were Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga and MPs Fred Outa (Nyando), Paul Otuoma (Funyula), Ben Achola (Khwisero), Wilbur Otichillo (Emuhaya) and Florence Mutua (Busia woman representative).
