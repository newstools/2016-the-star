Three senior police officers including Msambweni police boss Benjamin Rotich have been interdicted pending investigation over Shimoni sugar smuggling cartel.According to a source in the Coast regional office the others are Lunga Lunga DCIO and Head of Marine Unit at Shimoni, Kwale county.Matuga OCPD Patrick Oduma on Wednesday took over as the Msambweni boss on an acting capacity.When journalists visited the police station in the morning, Oduma sat on the OCPD s chair while the interdicted officer was signing some documents. The interdiction letters were sent from the regional office and most probably following an order from the National Police Service, the source said.The interdicted officers are accused of working with sugar cartels to smuggle illegal sugar into the country.Their contacts and a series of calls are said to have been found in the suspects' phones. The suspects had been arrested by KDF officers from where investigations that linked the officers were launched.Initial reports were that the total number of interdicted officers was 10, but Kwale county police boss James Akoru said on Tuesday he had "no idea about that number". It is a very serious issue. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet is bitter about the syndicate and cases of cartels colluding with police officers in smuggling business, a source said on Tuesday.Akoru said they managed to arrest two suspects and seize two lorries on Sunday night in collaboration with KDF officers at Shimoni. Police got information from members of the public and laid an ambush in which these suspects were apprehended, Akoru said in his office.He said that the first lorry carrying 247 bags of sugar was seized by the soldiers at Shimoni with the two suspects on board. The police in Msambweni found the other lorry carrying 250 bags of the illegal sugar abandoned at Ibiza in Diani. The driver after realising the police were following him abandoned the vehicle and escaped, he said.A multi-agency team is investigating the matter to get those behind the illicit trade. Msambweni acting police boss Patrick Oduma did not want to comment about the issue.Kwale county commissioner Kutswa Olaka could not be reached for a comment as his phone went unanswered.
