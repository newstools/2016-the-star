Yesterday Josephine Kabura gave evidence to PAC on how her 11 companies received Sh1.3 billion from the National Youth Service.She admitted that the companies were formed solely to win business from the NYS; they never filed tax returns; they received business through LPOs rather than approved tenders. The whole NYS saga stank more than ever as we listened to her testimony.Then amazingly she asked to go into camera as she feared for her life.Parliamentary committees can hear evidence in camera but it should only be when national security is at risk. This was not the case with Kabura. And if she feared for her life, any power broker she exposed would soon find out from friends inside PAC. It did not make any difference whether she testified in public or in private. Asking to testify in camera has become a dodge to avoid being publicly humiliated. MPs should not allow it unless they believe the security of the nation is at risk.Quote of the day: "It is much easier to show compassion to animals.
