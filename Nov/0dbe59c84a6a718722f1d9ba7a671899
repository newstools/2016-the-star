There is overwhelming evidence against former NYS deputy director general Adan Harakhe and former chairman of the Ministerial Tender Committee Hassan Noor, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said yesterday.The anti-graft body urged court to dismiss cases filed by Harakhe and Noor. The two are challenging their prosecution in connection with the NYS scandal, but the EACC says the decision to charge them is based on an independent review of evidence gathered by its investigators.It said the duo have not shown how their intended prosecution is actuated by ulterior motive or an abuse of the legal process. Their intended prosecution has a factual foundation based on evidence, which meets the threshold of a prima facie case, the EACC said.Harakhe and Noor got a temporary reprieve last Thursday after Justice Hedwig Ong udi barred the DPP and the police from arresting and preferring criminal charges against them. The charges are in relation the award of a tender to Blue Stars Limited for the supply and delivery of Sh47.6 million training materials.
