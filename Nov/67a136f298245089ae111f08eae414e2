Cord leader Raila Odinga unceremoniously left Shibale shopping centre,&nbsp;Mumias, on Friday after chaos erupted over who could address the people. Raila had gone to console people allegedly harassed by GSU officers,&nbsp;accompanied&nbsp;by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and MCAs Rocky Omwendo (Mumias North) and Libinus Oduor (Mayoni). He&nbsp; was forced to take off after the crowd turned violent accusing them of neglecting the victims. &nbsp; A witness said the incident, that&nbsp;left the window of Raila&#39;s vehicle shattered,&nbsp; began when he &nbsp;sent the two ward representatives to check if they could address residents. &quot;The MCAs (after being given the go-ahead) went and called Raila and Oparanya. They came and stood where&nbsp; Mumias East MP Benjamin&nbsp; Washiali &nbsp;was standing in readiness to give speeches,&quot; said the resident. But Washiali&nbsp;refused to give Oparanya the microphone.

But former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed asked the Governor why he had neglected the people despite their many votes he got from the Wanga community. &ldquo;Why should it take you two days to move from Kakamega to Mumias, a distance of less than 30km, yet your people were oppressed by security agents?&rdquo; he asked. Washiali and Oparanya reportedly started pushing each other before the latter &nbsp;took the microphone and tried addressing the people. But he was booed and accused of not having the people&#39;s interests at heart.

Why did Oparanya give Sh200 million to a businessman in the name of a grant for Mumias Sugar Company?&rdquo; he also asked. &ldquo;But 2017 is not far. We shall tell these people what your intentions are for them.&quot; The MP further accused Oparanya of double-speak and taking the people for granted.It was at this point that Raila marched to his damaged vehicle and left without addressing the people.
