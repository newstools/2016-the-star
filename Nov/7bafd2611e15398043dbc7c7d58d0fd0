Muslims in Lamu yesterday converged in Twaif Grounds to pray for rains. A drought has hit the county.The residents completed a four-day fast that started on Monday.The prayer, known as Istiqaai, was organised by Wanaharakati Okoa Lamu, an umbrella agency for Muslims and activist groups.Wanaharakati chief organising secretary Ustadh Mohamed Al-Amin said the primary objective of the prayer was to ask for God&rsquo;s forgiveness and appease Him so He can send them rain and save the county from disaster. Al-Amin said they need water to grow food and revive their dying livestock.It is estimated that at least 30,000 households and more than 300,000 head of cattle are in dire need of food and water.Areas that have been hard-hit by the drought include Basuba, Bargoni, Hindi, Kiangwe, Maisha Masha, Mangai, Mararani, Milimani, Moa, Pandanguo, Witu.&ldquo;I thank all the Muslims who have turned up for the Istisqaai prayer. The drought in our county at the moment is worrying. That&rsquo;s why we have decided to go back to Allah in prayer and to fast so that the drought, which seems like a punishment, can come to an end,&rdquo; Al-Amin said.Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya Lamu chairman Abubakar Shekuwe urged all muslims and county and national leaders to turn away from their evil ways and seek God&rsquo;s guidance to solve the problems Kenya faces.
