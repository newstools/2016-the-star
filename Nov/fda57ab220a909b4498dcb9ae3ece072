Former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo yesterday said there is no bad blood between himself, DP William Ruto and Senator Kipchumba Murkomen.This follows claims the two may have contributed to his sacking from the government. Kimaiyo said his recent announcement that he may consider running for President in 2022, does not mean he has a problem with Ruto. I was just expressing my ambitions. I respect all leaders, including the DP, Murkomen and President Uhuru Kenyatta, he told the Star in Eldoret.Kimaiyo said he will in two months announce the party he will use to run for Elgeyo Marakwet senator. I m still consulting with my people before we unveil the party and launch our campaigns, he said.Kimaiyo said he will explain how he left the positions of the IG and of chairman of the Kenya Airports Authority. I served with dedication and integrity. Some people may have fears, because of my political plans, but that is their own problem, he said.Kimaiyo is putting in a place a think-tank team to guide him during his campaigns. He said he will always work with all leaders in Elgeyo Marakwet to resolve the problems that face residents, including banditry attacks.Kimaiyo s announcement two weeks ago that he will vie for the Senate sparked off an exchange with Murkomen. The senator has been accused of undermining him when he was IG.Murkomen has denied the allegations. I was not Kimaiyo s appointing authority and could not thus decide anything to do with him, he said.
