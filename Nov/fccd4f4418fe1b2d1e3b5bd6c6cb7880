A section of leaders in Baringo county have disowned Kanu saying it has no place in the ruling Jubilee party.Led by Baringo central MP Sammy Mwaita, they dismissed claims that Kanu had signed a coalition agreement in 2013 with President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto."Kanu is already dead and at no point signed an agreement with Jubilee," he said on Saturday.He was addressing a fundraiser for women groups in Kapropita Primary School grounds.He was accompanied by Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi and woman rep Grace Kiptui.The leaders said Kanu members should stop pretending to align themselves with the "vibrant and independent" Jubilee party after "burying" their own."Gone are the days of Kanu and I want to tell my people of Baringo to reject them and reelect Jubilee leaders in 2017," Cheboi said.He said Jubilee has fulfilled almost all the projects pledged in 2013 and cited improved healthcare, water projects and the ongoing contruction of the Marigat-Karandi road among others.He also dismissed claims that there were ghost workers in his government after the Auditor General released a report indicating that Sh272 million was irregularly spent in Baringo county.More on this: We are paying staff not Ghost workers, says County Finance OfficerTheir dismissal of Kanu comes after party leader and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi dismissed the possibility of going into an alliance ahead of next year's polls.At a different fundraiser in Marigat on Friday, Gideon linked Jubilee with corrupt leaders and asked them to take action against them.MCAs at the event urged Gideon to run for president in 2022, a move that would likely upset the Deputy President who is eyeing the same seat on a Jubilee ticket.Jubilee is fighting to consolidate votes in the Rift Valley region.
