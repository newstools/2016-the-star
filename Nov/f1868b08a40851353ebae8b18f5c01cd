A section of Mandera leaders have defied the diktat of the Garre Council of Elders, refused to step down and declared they will run for reelection.In a negotiated democracy arrangement, the 21 elders decreed in August that most leaders should step down and make way for those they endorsed.However, several Jubilee leaders on Sunday said a few individuals have no right to make an important political decision on behalf of an entire community.They are Mohamed Noor (Mandera North), Mohamed Mohamud (Mandera West), Mohamed Hajji (Banisa), Mohamed Adan (Mandera South) and several MCAs.Speaking at Kotulu, each dismissed the elders decision on who will run for which seats. They called it an infringement on their democratic, constitutional rights. They said they will support Governor Ali Roba s reelection, despite the elders decision. We have come out to declare that 21 people cannot decide for a whole community. We want those who gave us the mandate to be in office to be the same people who will decide whether we should leave or we should be reelected, Mohamud said. We will be on the ballot to defend our seats on the Jubilee Party ticket.
