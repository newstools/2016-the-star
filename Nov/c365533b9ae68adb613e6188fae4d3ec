After exiting the ongoing Africa Women Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Kenya women s football team, Harambee Starlets have switched focus to International competitions andfriendlies lined up for next year.Harambee Starlets, who were making their debut to the biennial event, lost all their Group B matches against Ghana 3-1, Mali 3-1 and 4-0 to the champions Nigeria last Saturday.Speaking on arrival from Cameroon, Harambee Starlets team manager and former national team player, Doreen Nabwire, said the team has received invitation to play in next year s Turkey Gold City tournament and are scheduled to visit Germany for friendlies with women s Bundesliga sides.Nabwire said team s participation in the AWCON has been a good learning curve for the players and the technical bench at large but was quick to note that for the East African to match their West Africans counterparts in future, a lot still needs to be done. Really, it has to start with the players themselves. The question is are they doing enough on their own and are they on good nutrition? At some point, individual brilliance matters, where teams collectivity has failed, observed the official.She added: Football Kenya Federation continue to support the national teams and going forward, we can only hope for the best. But first things first, we need a competitive women s league. However, it can only be competitive if sponsors come on board and we therefore appeal to companies and well-wishers to join forces and sponsor the league. We want to be in the next edition of AWCON and hopefully, qualify for 2019 World Cup.
