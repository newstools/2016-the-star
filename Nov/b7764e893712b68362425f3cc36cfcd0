Air travel budgets in Africa are expected to rise 24 per cent if the planned pan-African passport is introduced in 2018, a survey by the global travel technology provider Sabre Corporation suggested yesterday. Respondents in the survey said they are willing to spend about $1,100 (Sh112,046) to $1,500 (Sh152,790) more annually on air travel within the continent if the need for a visa is eliminated. Travellers from four countries - South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Egypt were surveyed, with those having flown in the past 24 months saying they would spend 24 per cent more with the introduction of the passport, the firm said.The African Union launched the African passport in July 2016. The goal is to have the document in circulation by 2020 across the 54 member states.The new passport will enable African travellers to visit other countries on the continent without a visa.Sabre said the survey aimed to uncover the opportunities and challenges faced by African travellers today, in a bid to help airlines address these to support their own growth and provide travellers a better journey.
