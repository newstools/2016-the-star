Members of the Knut Thika branch today will take to the streets to protest against the killing of their colleague on Sunday.John Mwangi was shot dead when chaos erupted after a music extravaganza attended by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and Murang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s Mwangi Wairia. He was a maths teacher at Thika Barracks Primary School.&ldquo;The police have 24 hours to say who shot our colleague, whether it&rsquo;s a police officer or a civilian. Else we take to the streets Thursday to demand justice for our fallen colleague,&rdquo; Thika Knut executive secretary Joe Mungai said.He spoke at General Kago Funeral Home after viewing Mwangi&rsquo;s body on Tuesday. Mungai criticised the police for being irresponsible by using live bullets instead of rubber ones to disperse the crowd. Doctors said Mwangi died of a gunshot wound. CARRIED A BIBLE&ldquo;The teacher had some documents and a Bible with him when he was shot, which clearly indicated that he was not a pickpocket. The police&rsquo;s priority was to run after rowdy youth instead of rushing our colleague to hospital to try and save his life,&rdquo; he said. But Thika OCPD Erastus Muthamia defended his officers, saying they did not use live bullets. &ldquo;The whole scenario is under investigation and we&rsquo;ll soon ascertain whether it&rsquo;s the goons who were mugging residents who had a rifle. We&rsquo;ve arrested six culprits,&rdquo; Muthamia said.Mungai urged Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i and TSC to ensure justice is done for the devoted teacher.
