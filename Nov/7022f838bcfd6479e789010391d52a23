Members of the Knut Thika branch today will take to the streets to protest against the killing of their colleague on Sunday.John Mwangi was shot dead when chaos erupted after a music extravaganza attended by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and Murang a s Mwangi Wairia. He was a maths teacher at Thika Barracks Primary School. The police have 24 hours to say who shot our colleague, whether it s a police officer or a civilian. Else we take to the streets Thursday to demand justice for our fallen colleague, Thika Knut executive secretary Joe Mungai said.He spoke at General Kago Funeral Home after viewing Mwangi s body on Tuesday. Mungai criticised the police for being irresponsible by using live bullets instead of rubber ones to disperse the crowd. Doctors said Mwangi died of a gunshot wound. CARRIED A BIBLE The teacher had some documents and a Bible with him when he was shot, which clearly indicated that he was not a pickpocket. The police s priority was to run after rowdy youth instead of rushing our colleague to hospital to try and save his life, he said. But Thika OCPD Erastus Muthamia defended his officers, saying they did not use live bullets. The whole scenario is under investigation and we ll soon ascertain whether it s the goons who were mugging residents who had a rifle. We ve arrested six culprits, Muthamia said.Mungai urged Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i and TSC to ensure justice is done for the devoted teacher.
