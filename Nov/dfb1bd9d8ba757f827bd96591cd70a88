More than 50 Kisumu based journalists took to the streets on Monday in protest against police brutality on their colleagues countrywide.Members of the Kisumu Journalists Network (KJN) said police officers were infringing on media freedom as envisaged in the constitution. We condemn in the strongest term possible the brutality witnessed in Nairobi on journalists who were covering peaceful anti-graft demonstrations last Thursday, said KJN chairman Dickson Odhiambo.The journalists, who marched and shouted through Kisumu streets, asked the government to acknowledge reporters and the work they do and treat them with dignity."We are doing our work like any other person... Officers should give us our space...Aren't journalists human?" asked one of the protesters.Odhiambo said they do their work in line with articles 34 and 35 of the constitution so should not be subjected to harassment by anyone. We are witnessing a scenario where journalists covering high profile cases of corruption, both at the counties and national government, are being targeted by police and some powerful forces who do not want such cases given coverage in the media, he said.Read: Prosecute politicians assaulting journalists, Media Council tells DPPAlso read: Study reveals more women journalists harassed by stalkers onlineOdhiambo added that a group of Kisumu journalists almost got involved in an accident after police hurled tear gas canisters inside their vehicle while they covered anti-IEBC demonstrations in May. We therefore call upon IG Joseph Boinet to carry out speedy investigations and ensure officers involved in harassing Nairobi journalists are held personally responsible for their actions, he said.A member of the group lauded KJN for rejecting a Bill proposed by the Kenya Film Classification Board for media content to be controlled.Kisumu Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada and local politician Richard Ogendo, who joined the demonstrations, called for the protection of the freedom of the press.Ogada said the liberation Kenya achieved also covered the media.He asked senators and MPs to demand proper public participation, where the Bill is concerned, for the sake of getting adequate input.There was a showdown between anti-riot police officers and journalists during an anti-corruption protest by human rights activists in Nairobi. The group turned up at Freedom Corner to demonstrate for action by President Uhuru Kenyatta, in the wake of a probe into the alleged theft of Sh5 billion at the Health ministry.The officers under the command of Kilimani OCS Ronald Ngau, attacked journalists who filmed them as they dispersed the demonstrators.They beat the people with batons and fired volleys of tear gas to disperse them from the location at Uhuru Park.More on this: Kenyan police beat anti-corruption protesters, fire tear gasAlso read: Police, goons turn on journalists in Mafya House protestsOn Sunday, State House accused the media of misrepresenting President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda for the country.Spokesman Manoah Esipisu called for responsible reporting saying it is not a luxury to be undertaken at the whim of reporters.Read: State House scolds media for shoddy reporting after Uhuru attacks Raila
