Professionals from three Kisumu subcounties and non-natives will meet on November 18 to decide who to back for governor. The professionals are from Kisumo (Kisumu West), Kajulu (Kisumu East), Nyakach. The bloc is chaired by lawyer Francis Wasuna and businessmen Jackson Misumi and Victor Maina.The group has met three times to discuss interested candidates and distribution of seats. They include former Nyakach MP Peter Odoyo and former Kisumu county executive for roads Vincent Kodera. Others under consideration are Prof Larry Gumbe and former Kisumu Town MP Ken Nyagudi. We are exploiting available opportunities. If we find no suitable candidate among those who have declared interest, then we will front the person most capable, Kodera said yesterday. As professionals and opinion leaders from various subcounties, we are capable of supporting a candidate financially, morally and politically. Aspirants include Senator Anyang Nyong o, WFP employee Asaka Nyangara, architect Christopher Ondiek, banker David Wayiera, former lecturer Gordon Okumu, businessman Hezron McObewa, surgeon James Obondi and Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga. Kodera said for effective governance, all residents must be engaged in county leadership. The Nyakach parliamentary aspirant said the bloc is purely for development and political inclusion. He said it will culminate in a political agreement that will usher in an inclusive government, unlike the current one. Kodera said the Kisumu County Diaspora group, which has complained of being sidelined by the current leadership, cannot be ignored, as it has 200,000 voters.
