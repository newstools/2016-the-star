Why the reluctance to prosecute individuals implicated in mega corruption scandals? South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya on Sunday said &ldquo;small fish&rdquo; are prosecuted while the &ldquo;big fish&rdquo; who have embezzled billions of shillings are left untouched.&ldquo;The government should take serious steps in fighting graft, which has tainted the country&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; Nyamweya said. &ldquo;We cannot have a situation where people involved in big scandals go scot-free. They must face legal action.&rdquo; He spoke at Nyansakia II Catholic Church in Bomachoge Chache constituency where he presided over a fundraiser for Ogembo Parish. Nyamweya said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration&rsquo;s chest-thumping that it has initiated many development projects across the country is a &ldquo;white lie&rdquo;.&ldquo;The administration should stop cheating Kenyans that it has brought development. Some parts are lagging behind in terms of development,&rdquo; he said. Nyamweya accused the Kisii government of misappropriating funds.
