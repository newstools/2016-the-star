Why the reluctance to prosecute individuals implicated in mega corruption scandals? South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya on Sunday said small fish are prosecuted while the big fish who have embezzled billions of shillings are left untouched. The government should take serious steps in fighting graft, which has tainted the country s image, Nyamweya said. We cannot have a situation where people involved in big scandals go scot-free. They must face legal action. He spoke at Nyansakia II Catholic Church in Bomachoge Chache constituency where he presided over a fundraiser for Ogembo Parish. Nyamweya said President Uhuru Kenyatta s administration s chest-thumping that it has initiated many development projects across the country is a white lie . The administration should stop cheating Kenyans that it has brought development. Some parts are lagging behind in terms of development, he said. Nyamweya accused the Kisii government of misappropriating funds.
