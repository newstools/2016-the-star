A German firm that was contracted by City Hall to set up a Sh28 billion power plant at the Dandora dumpsite withdrew because the county lacks a title deed for the land, a report says.The 2014-15 report by Auditor General Edward Ouko shows the firm Sustainable Environment Management UG had asked the county to provide the title deed for the 30 acres before it invests in the project.The firm was to eliminate the need to relocate the dumpsite by investing in renewable energy using the waste as the raw material to produce as much as 160MW of power daily. The waste is used to generate methane gas in a renewable cycle.The waste yard was declared full more than 20 years ago and attempts to relocate it to Ruai failed. This was after the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority objected on grounds the dumpsite would pose a danger of bird hits and interfere with landing and takeoff at JKIA.Speaking on the sidelines of the sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in August, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero said the firm had failed to raise the required money. At the moment we are looking for another investor to hand over the project to. The earlier firm could not raise the required amount so the project never took off, the governor said.Yesterday, county Lands executive Christopher Khaemba told the Star on the phone they do not have a title deed for the land but they can acquire one if they get a serious investor. He said City Hall conducted an inquiry and realised the investor was unable to raise the money required for the project.The auditor s report also raised issues over the way the Dandora dumpsite is managed, citing lack of standby power backup in case of blackouts and lack of protective clothes for workers.Nairobi generates about 2,400 tonnes of solid waste daily but only about 1,500 tonnes is collected and deposited in Dandora.
