In the end, we got to the final which was good against quality opposition,&rdquo; he noted.The captain admitted that there are a few areas they need to work on before the World Rugby Sevens Series opener in Dubai.&ldquo;We need to tighten up on our defence considering we gave away soft tries to South Africa in the final. We have time on our side to work on those weak points for Dubai and Cape Town next month.&rdquo;Senior players including vice captain and world series top try scorer Collins Injera and Oscar Ouma are slated to return to the team for the two opening tournaments in Dubai and Cape Town after missing out on Namibia due to work commitments and injury. Among the players that impressed at the two-day event included Martin Owila, Derek Mayar, Brian Tanga and Aluda Beda.Competition for places in the squad is expected to be intense with the 12-man squad to Dubai and Cape Town expected to be named in two weeks.
