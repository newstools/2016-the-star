Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has asked members of the Maasai community to shun family planning and have more children in order to increase their numbers.Moi said this during a thanksgiving service on the election of Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson Sapit.The Kanu chairman told Narok, Kajiado, Nakuru and Laikipia county residents that God gave them huge tracts of arable land to enable them to take care of their families.There should be no fear in having more children, like other communities in Kenya, he said at the cleric&rsquo;s Olenteem home in Narok North constituency on Saturday."Members of the Maasai community will increase their bargaining power in national politics if they have more voters just like the larger communities which cannot be underrated when positions are shared," said Moi.He noted that once they have the numbers, whoever ignores them will do at his own peril.Read: Maa community will back Uhuruto in 2017, Wasreb boss Ntimama saysThe Senator called for the revival of the Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu unity caucus, popularly known as KAMATUSA, for pastoralist communities to increase their bargaining power in future governments."During the Kanu era in power, KAMATUSA was a force to be reckoned with and we were able to maintain our position in power due to that unity. We need to come together as pastoralist communities to ensure everybody takes us seriously,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Moi.Kanu secretary general Nick Salat asked Narok North MP Moitalel Kenta to go back to the former ruling party since his deputy secretary general post was still vacant.Salat also said Kenta has been frustrated by Jubilee Party on whose ticket he was elected in 2013."I knew my friend Kenta would be frustrated by the Jubilee government, after he defected from Kanu to TNA before the last general election, since he is a straightforward person," he said."It is good that he has now seen what I told him. He is very welcome to join us and take his position."ODM leader Raila Odinga, Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, former Gataga MP Peter Kenneth and legislators Patrick Ntutu (Narok West), Soipan Tuya (Narok woman representative), Elijah Memusi (Kajiado Central) and Moses Sakuda(Kajiado West) were also present.
