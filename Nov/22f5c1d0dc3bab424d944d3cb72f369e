Trump said.Trump said he is not required by law to alter his relationship with his business, but added: "I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.""Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!" he added.
