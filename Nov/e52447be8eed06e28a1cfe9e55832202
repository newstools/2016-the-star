International Elly Ajowi of Kenya Police &lsquo;Chafua Chafua&rsquo; fought to an emphatic 3-0 victory to be crowned the 2016 Kenya Open champion as action ended at Kaloleni Social Hall, Nairobi over the weekend.Ajowi, who is Kenya&rsquo;s first choice light-heavyweight defeated Kennedy Ogutu 3-0 to be crowned this year&rsquo;s Kenya Open champion.Ajowi, who failed in his bid to make it to Rio Olympic during Yaound&eacute; qualifiers last March, fought his heart out tormenting his opponent with heavy punches on the head.In the latter stages of the bout, the Prisons boxer appeared to fizzle out but went the full distance, losing on points. This year&rsquo;s event, however, turned out to be an anticlimax with several Kenya team mainstays giving it a wide berth.And for the first time in many years, Kenya Defence Forces (formerly Afaba) failed to enter a boxer in the finals after benching six of their first choice boxers. KDF officials couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment but sources indicated that they are preserving them for Inter Brigades Championships slated for early December.KDF boxers, who failed to honour this year&rsquo;s edition included Olympian Nick Okoth (lightweight), welterweight Black Moses Mathenge, super heavyweight Frederick Ramogi, middleweight Edwin Okongo, Victor Odhiambo (light welterweight) and flyweight Simon Mungai. Prison were without Harrison Mathuku and Olympian Aziz Ali, who got injured during last month&rsquo;s national league championship.Police fielded a near full strength team with their light welterweight Joseph Shigali beating Hudson Mwiti of Coast to the Kenya Open title.It was a bitter pill for Jackson Okwiri to swallow after he lost the flyweight final to Dennis Muthama of Nairobi. Jackson, a younger sibling of Olympian and APB star Rayton Okwiri, lost the bout 1-2 but not without a fight. He gave the Nairobi boxer as much as he received in the three-rounder.Final Results:Light flyweight: Abdallah Athumani (Coast) lost to Matayo Kenya (Nairobi) 0-3; Flyweight: Jackson Okwiri (Coast) lost to Dennis Muthama (Nairobi) 1-2; Bantamweight: Joseph Gatambo (Nairobi) lost to Kennedy Okello (Prisons)1-2; Lightweight: Ethan Maina (Police) beat Washington Wandera (Oksa); Light welterweight: Joseph Shigali (Police) beat Hudson Mwiti (Coast); Welterweight: Denzel Onyango (Oksa) beat Boniface Mugunde (Police); Middleweight: Light Heavyweight: Elly Ajowi (Police) beat Kennedy Ogutu (Prisons); Ladies Light flyweight; Christine Ongare (Eddy Musi) beat Veronica Mbithe (Dallas) 3-0; Ladies welterweight: Angela Akotj (Nairobi) lost to Beatrice Akoth (Box Girls)
