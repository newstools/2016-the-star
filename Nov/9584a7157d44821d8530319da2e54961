Cord leader Raila Odinga has urged the Kalenjin community to help him remove Jubilee from power by supporting his presidential bid.He was made a Kalenjin elder and given blessings to run for President when he visited Meibeki Karona trading centre, Uasin Gishu, yesterday. Present were ODM MPs Andrew Toboso (Butere), John Mbadi (Suba), Millie Odhiambo (Mbita) and Simba Arati (Dagoreti North).Raila later went to Tot in the Kerio Valley to address peace rallies. The Valley has been hit by many banditry cases. The region is a Jubilee stronghold and the backyard of Deputy President William Ruto. Raila said he will tour the Rift Valley soon.He said Jubilee has not fulfilled its pledges. Jubilee has presided over graft as most Kenyans suffer in abject poverty. They have stolen left, right and centre from the National Youth Service projects, the Eurobond and other scandals, Raila said. They are yet to tell us where the Eurobond money disappeared to along with all the other theft of public funds. He said Jubilee has not fulfilled its pledge to build 10,000km of road in all parts of the country. If you support me next year, I am capable of streamlining things in the country. I need you to help me remove Jubilee from power in 2017, Raila said.He said he was not responsible for the ICC case against Ruto. Raila said the case was used to campaign against him in the Rift Valley in 2013, yet there was no way I would have betrayed Ruto over the 2007-08 post-election violence when we were both in ODM. You, the people of Rift Valley, denied me votes because of false claims that I fixed Ruto. That was not true at all, he said. Mbadi urged the elders to tell Ruto to work with Raila if he expects to ascend to the country s top leadership . He said Ruto has no chance of succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta through Jubilee.
