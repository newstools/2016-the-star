Senators yesterday directed the office of clerk Jeremiah Nyegeye to write to the Inspector General of Police to arrest the Machakos governor on Monday.The Senate s Public Accounts Committee members want Governor Alfred Mutua brought before it at 2.30pm to answer audit queries raised in the auditor general s 2013-14 report. The committee resolves that the Inspector General of Police should produce Mutua on November 28, vice chairman John Lonyangapuo said at Parliament Buildings. Lonyangapuo was chairing the committee as substantive chairman as Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o was said to be away.Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale moved the motion for Mutua to be arrested and his Kiambu counterpart Kimani Wamatangi seconded it.Khalwale said Mutua has snubbed the committee with impunity.Wamatangi said Mutua is taking the wrong advice and is now emulating Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who has also not appeared before the committee. Somebody has misadvised Mutua, unfortunately he is being given the wrong advice. He has perfected the tactics of dodging this committee by giving flimsy excuses, he said.Nominated Senator Martha Wangari unsuccessfully pushed for Mutua to be arrested and be brought before the committee today, saying he is known to use painkillers by moving to court to block arrest or coming to the Senate .Senators George Khaniri (Vihiga), Amos Wako (Busia), Henry Ndiema (Trans Nzoia ) and Muriuki Karue (Nyandarua) said Mutua must be ready to be held to account for public resources.Wako said residents will soon ask questions regarding Mutua s refusal to appear.Mutua, through a staff member, said he was unable to attend the session as he was preoccupied with the issue of impeachment.His impeachment flopped on Wednesday as some MCAs were away in Tanzania for benchmarking, causing a quorum hitch.Lonyangapuo said Mutua has received several summonses. He was to appear before the committee on October 5, but did not show up, saying he was out of the country.Mutua, through acting county secretary Grace Munguti, wrote to the committee, saying he is unavailable.He suggested that he be represented in the committee by county senior officers . It is practically impossible for him to appear in person, the letter dated October 3 reads.
