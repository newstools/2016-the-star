Nairobi MCAs have threatened to halt county operations if Governor Evans Kidero does not sack acting county secretary Robert Ayisi.They say the powerful official the link between the executive and the assembly has been using his powers to suppress and belittle them.The MCAs said Ayisi has been acting secretary far too long. He was appointed in January but interim positions can only be held for six months.In a motion unanimously approved on Tuesday, the ward representatives said they will not conduct any business with Ayisi nor handle any business from the executive, unless the secretary is fired. The motion was tabled by minority leader Abdi Guyo. The law is very clear, Mr Speaker. There is no way a person can be in an acting capacity for more than six months, he said. The assembly shall consider any business transacted by the acting county secretary null and void and will pay no recognition nor respect to any actions by the aforesaid in dispensing the duty of the county secretary. Ayisi was appointed in an acting capacity by Kidero in January to take over from Lilian Ndegwa, who was sacked after she was charged with defrauding the county of Sh17 million.The county secretary is the head of the County Public Service. He conveys decisions of the executive to individuals and authorities,including the assembly. If the MCAs make good their threat, then most of the county operations will come to a halt.The MCAs criticised Ayisi for attempting to evict the assembly staff from the offices on the South Wing of City Hall, defying summons and delaying answering committee queries.Last week, the county executive obtained a court order stopping the assembly from evicting its staff from the offices in the South Wing.But majority leader Elias Otieno said the wing was gazetted by the IEBC as the assembly precincts in March 2013.
