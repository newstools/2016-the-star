More than 30,000 residents of a settlement scheme in Kuresoi South have given the government one month to connect them to the main electricity grid or face rebellion.Baraget settlement scheme residents said they are uncomfortable that they have not benefited from the last mile connectivity programme yet they have supported Jubilee.The group cried foul that they have been neglected by the government despite their firm support against the rebellion it is facing in most parts of the South Rift.Led by SDA pastor Richard Chepkwony, they said that they want their homes and schools to be connected to the grid.He said that the area's electricity distribution infrastructure was built four years ago but no electricity has been supplied to the region."We have been firmly supporting Jubilee against the tide of Isaac Rutto's CCM and we are tired," Chepkwony said."We voted Jubilee 100 percent in 2013 but we have not gain from any county or national government project," he said at a meeting in Baraget on Wednesday."We get media reports of President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto connecting power in homes but nobody cares about our welfare," Joel Rotich, a resident, said.Rotich said that they are tired of being fooled by politicians who only come and initiate projects during the campaign period only for the same to stall after elections.The electricity posts were installed when Magerer Lagat was an assistant minister in the ministry of energy.The residents claimed that area MP Zakayo Cheruiyot, Keringet MCA Leah Serem and Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua have not visited them since their election in 2013.The group was resettled in the region by former President Daniel Moi after they were displaced by post poll violence of 1992 and 1997 at Lare, Njoro constituency.They asked Energy CS Charles Keter to come to their rescue as soon as possible, further noting that no school in the region has received tablets issued under the digital learning scheme.Read: Cheaper energy still unaffordable to rural households
