Uasin Gishu speaker Isaac Terer will be summoned by MCAs over claims he swindled athlete Daniel Komen out of money and property worth Sh150 million. Terer has denied the accusation.The double World Indoor 1,500m silver medalist has sued Terer to recover his property. Because the matter touches on a member of the assembly, we will discuss it and then hand it over to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the assembly to investigate and bring us a report, majority leader Josphat Lowoi said yesterday. We will hear from both parties before we make any move. Komen has filed the case at the Environment and Lands Court in Eldoret town. He says Terer was his financial adviser and lawyer. Komen says he charged Terer with buying land in Eldoret town worth Sh12 million. He says he paid money requested by Terer but he is yet to have the property transferred to him despite many attempts.Komen accuses Terer of secretly inserting his name in sale agreements to falsely indicate they were partners. But Terer says he and Komen were business partners and he contributed more than Sh5 million towards purchase of the property.Komen has produced documents showing he deposited money as advised by Terer towards the purchase of the land. The hearing will be on November 24. Komen has also filed a complaint at the Advocates Disciplinary Committee.
