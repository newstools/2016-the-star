Heavy rain in Kitui county has washed away bridges, cut off roads and turned some into small rivers, forcing the state to deploy a helicopter to deliver KCSE exam materials to schools. We have taken measures to ensure the exams are not disrupted and deployed a chopper to distribute the materials to the examination centres as we monitor the situation in all areas to ensure fidelity of the exam, Kitui county commissioner Boaz Cherutich told journalists.The KCSE exam is in its last week.Several drifts and bridges constructed across seasonal rivers, ,especially in Mwingi Central, have been swept away, cutting off transport and communication from the interior of the county to Kitui town.Public service vehicle owners and drivers said they have suspended operations on the Kitui-Mutomo road until the rains subside.Meanwhile, two siblings drowned in Mwingi North as they attempted to cross a swollen river on their own.Cherutich has urged chiefs and assistant chiefs to caution residents, especially children, against playing near or walking close to swollen rivers. It is your duty to ensure residents observe safety measures, he told the chiefs.
