A petition has been filed in Parliament seeking the removal of Council of Legal Education CEO Kulundu Bitonye for overstaying beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60.He is 64.Petitioner Anunda Marendi filed the petition on Monday. He says Kulundu, who was appointed in 2004, should be declared unfit to hold public office. Marendi says his continued stay in office is unconstitutional.He says it is against national values and integrity. The continued occupation of office by Kulundu sets a dangerous precedent, Marendi says in his petition.In April 2009, Public Service minister Dalmas Otieno raised the retirement age of civil servants from 55 to 60 years, saying the move would ensure skilled people remain in service longer.The Council of Legal Education trains lawyers after their completion of an undergraduate degree in Law from a recognised university. Students attend the school to be prepared for admission as a practicing lawyer. Marendi in the petition says it is wrong for Kulundu to continue drawing salary from the position. The continued occupation of the office is irregular, irrational and unfair to other Kenyans, Marendi says. The right to transparency and non-discrimination of all public officers and civil servants to retire at 60 years and the rights of Kenyans to benefit from implementation of key policies is likely to be compromised, he said.Yesterday, Kulundu told the Star he is not aware of the petition. He said he can only be dismissed by the Head of Public Service. I don t employ myself. Ask my employer, he said on the phone.Before being appointed the head of KSL, Kulundu served as a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, where he rose to a professor. He also served in Rhodes University.Kulundu is credited with transforming the institution.
