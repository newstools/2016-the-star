The Commission for Revenue Allocation has proposed scrapping off of all nominated MCA slots through constitutional amendments.Chairman Micah Cheserem on Tuesday said that would reduced the heavy burden of wage bill to the taxpayers.Cheresem said the current 777 nominated MCA's have overstretched the wage bill since most of the funds disbursed to county governments under devolution are mainly for salaries.He said in most cases the few amounts that remain after sorting salaries for county staffs end up being diverted to projects that were not intended for."It is an irony that the national government is fighting to have a say in the counties and governors are too fighting to have the same say which in most cases is a duplication of resources," he said.More on this: Kuria raises issues for referendum to scrap Senate, cut MCAs to contain wage billCheserem said forging forward one of the levels should be done away with.He said the county, Senate and National assemblies should slash the nominated positions to ease the burden of wage bill on taxpayers.But he noted that revenue collections at the county levels had increased after implementation of automated revenue collection systems. He said, "The total revenue collection in the 2015-16 financial year increased by 3.5 per cent to Sh35.02 billion, according to a report from the Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo". Cheserem maintained millions of revenue would be saved from disappearing to individuals pockets if all counties effect the automated technology. This program is efficient and also a way of fighting stealing which is becoming rampant in most of our institutes, he said.He said they expect to identify ways to seal revenue leakages in counties which are yet to fully digitise their systems."We have an opportunity to do better if seal some loopholes," he saidAlso read: Audit calls for reduction of MPs, MCAs
