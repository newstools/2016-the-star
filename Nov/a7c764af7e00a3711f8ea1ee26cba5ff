The rich volcanic soils around Mt Kenya could help the world stop the rise of superbugs, the strains of bacteria that have become resistant to most antibiotics commonly used today.Four Kenyan scientists say the soils contain insect-killing roundworms from which they extracted compounds six times more powerful than the two best antibiotics used today. They developed a drug candidate known as Mursamacin. This may herald novel and new potential medicines for treatment of the world s most prevalent antibiotic resistant bacteria, team leader Ryan Awori said on Thursday.He said the encapsulated drug will be ready for the market in the next five years once it gets approval.Awori was feted at the Falling Walls in Berlin, where he made the presentation.He said the drug can be applied on an open wound to fasten healing. The antibiotic is the result of a collaboration between Awori and researchers at Trek Science, a start-up biotech company, in partnership with the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology, the University of Nairobi and the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation.Awori was in September declared the winner at the first Falling Walls Lab of Kenya in Nairobi, for his presentation titled Breaking the Wall of Antimicrobial Resistance .The drug is an important discovery when the world faces a growing number of superbug infections resistant to commonly used antibiotics.Countries are fighting to stop a future where once treatable diseases become pandemic and deadly. Health CS Cleopa Mailu said Kenya has been working to forestall microbial resistance since 1990s. Medics fear that, one day, C-sections and other operations will be too risky to perform with so many drug-resistant bugs lurking.
