Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday urged Chief Justice David Maraga to resist attempts by any arm of government to compromise him as he leads the judiciary.Raila told justice Maraga, who took office 12 days ago, to continue with the tradition of his predecessor Willy Mutunga to protect the independence of the judiciary. Maraga is the second CJ the country has appointed under the current Constitution. His sentiment comes less than two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta said the nation is not ready for another activist CJ , faulting Judicial Service Commission for appointing former CJ Mutunga five years ago.Yesterday the opposition leader, who paid a courtesy call on the CJ, said the new office comes with numerous challenges. He urged Maraga to continue with reforms started by retired CJ Mutunga.Raila s sentiments were echoed by Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka, who told Maraga to be bold and aggressive against attempts to defeat the Constitution.Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula, who was present at the meeting, emphasised on the need to increase the pace of litigation to clear the backlog of cases.Maraga said he will continue with the reform agenda in the judiciary and said he is ready for any election cases. I want to assure the country that the judiciary is prepared to handle any election petitions that may arise next year and I hope Parliament will appropriate sufficient funds to enable us perform this task satisfactorily, said the CJ.He said he wants to build a strong judiciary and restore public confidence in the institution. His priority, he said, will be to reduce case backlog, digitise operations and maintain independence of the judiciary.
