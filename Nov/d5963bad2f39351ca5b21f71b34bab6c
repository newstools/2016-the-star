Barack Obama's downbeat election night message has been compared to a concession today after he told Americans: "No matter what happens, the sun will rise in the morning".The outgoing US President has urged the country to stay calm after the most divisive campaign in living memory.He now looks increasingly likely to be replaced in the White House by Donald Trump, barring a late surge from Hillary Clinton.In video message for Buzzfeed News he said: "Let's face it. This has been an exhausting, stressful and sometimes downright weird election for all of us. "But here's what I want everybody to know: While we've certainly seen some new things this time around, what isn't new is that our democracy has always been rowdy and raucous. We've been through tough and divisive elections before and we've always come out stronger for it. He added: "Remember, no matter what happens, the sun will rise in the morning and America will still be the greatest nation on earth'.His message was downbeat - and in marked contrast with his buoyant mood on the previous night, where he and wife Michelle joined the Clintons and daughter Chelsea on stage at a final glitzy rally in Philadelphia.It came after the most divisive US presidential election in modern history ended last night with long queues outside polling stations in what was forecast to be a record voter turnout.Defying fears that many voters would be so disgusted by the ugliness of the battle and the candidates' obvious failings that they would stay at home, they heeded calls from both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that too much was at stake not to vote.Some pundits hailed the strong turnout as a triumph for democracy, bringing back voters on both sides who had become alienated from the political process. In 2012, just 57 per cent of eligible adults bothered to vote.But it was also a sign of the huge divisions in US politics. Polls show that, whoever wins, they will take over a ferociously polarised country in which half the electorate has vowed not to support whoever wins.
