Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi will also head to Western this weekend, as Cord leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta attend earlier planned functions in the region. The presence of the three political heavy weights wooing voters in the region is an indication of the importance of the Luhya vote to the presidential race. President Uhuru Kenyatta was in Bungoma county yesterday to preside over the first graduation ceremony for Kibabii University and visit the Pan Paper mills in Webuye. “The President will finish his day’s business and fly back to Nairobi. He is planning a full-week development tour of the region soon,” Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe said yesterday. Wangwe is part of the Jubilee Party campaign team in Western. Raila will preside over the ODM Western Delegates’ Convention at Golf Hotel in Kakamega tomorrow. Mudavadi will be in Bungoma and Kakamega counties. He will attend a funds drive for Lwandayi Secondary School in Bungoma tomorrow and another fundraiser for Mting’ong’o Friends’ Church in Malava, Kakamega, on Sunday. Mudavadi is popularising the National Super Alliance, an outfit to unite the opposition to challenge JP. He has said that he is in talks with other opposition leaders to unite. Mudavadi and Raila are selling the need for a united opposition in Western, a region traditionally perceived as divided.
