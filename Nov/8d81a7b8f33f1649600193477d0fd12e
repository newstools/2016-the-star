Wajir residents who own illicit firearms have been urged to surrender them to the government or be charged with illegal possession.County commissioner Michael ole Tialal yesterday said many guns are in the hands of civilians, a situation that poses significant threat to other residents. We urge all those who own firearms illegally to surrender them before we initiate a forcible disarmament programme, he said.The government estimates that about 700 illegal firearms are in the county. Tialal s warning comes barely a week after fighting erupted between rival clans in Wajir.At least six people were killed on Friday last week during a gunfight in Bagala location on the border of Wajir West and Eldas subcounties.Each clan claims ownership of Bagala, the land at the centre of the conflict.Saleh called for calm and urged residents to resolve conflicts through proper mechanisms, such as negotiation, instead of killing each other.
