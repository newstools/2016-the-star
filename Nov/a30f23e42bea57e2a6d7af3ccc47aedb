Two National Police Service Commission employees have been arrested on suspicion of soliciting pre-vetting bribes from traffic police.Secretary Purity Nyaga and clerk Alice Murugi are believed to be members of a cartel seeking bribes from officers for favourable results during vetting.NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi yesterday confirmed the arrests but declined to comment further. The two allegedly promised an officer they would clean up his &ldquo;mess&rdquo; to save his job.The officer is reported to have declined to offer the cash and reported the matter to Kavuludi who called for investigations. Two mobile phone numbers used to call police officers for bribes are alleged to have been traced to the two female staff. The cellphones are, however, not registered in their names.This latest issue has put the spotlight on the NPSC, which has fought allegations by police officers that some of its commissioners and staff had demanded bribes from them. Kavuludi has denied claims some police officer bribed the vetting panel to get favourable verdicts.&ldquo;If there are claims of bribery, let them specify which party exactly was bribed,&rdquo; he said during a vetting session in Eldoret.
