More than 500 women leaders from Nakuru have termed the recently nominated Jubilee campaign team unfit to lead .The leaders were irked by the inclusion of assembly speaker Susan Kihika who was appointed to head the team in Central Rift Valley.Under the Wamama na Jubilee movement, the group which met in Naivasha on Wednesday, said it was ready to campaign for President Uhruu Kenyatta, but not with Kihika as their leaders.Chairperson Esther Nyokabi said the speaker had neither been seen on the ground nor held any public meeting, especially in Naivasha."We shall be supporting one of our own but we won t work with Kihika because she has no support at the grassroots level," she said.Nyokabi, who doubles as the Naivasha branch Maendeleo ya Wanawake chair, asked those wishing to vie for any position in the region to join Jubilee Party.She said the move by Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua to support the President was welcome, but asked her to dissolve her party for the ruling coalition.James Karimi, acting Nakuru county Jubilee coordinator, said the President was misadvised into appointing Kihika to the team.Karimi said time has come for the involvement of the National Intelligence Service when such appointments are made to the will of the people is honoured."She has no support at the grassroots. No one knows her here. We wonder how she made it to the presidential campaign team," he said."We are determined to sell JP to all corners of this county because we know where to go and how to speak to the people so as to fully embrace the party ahead of the elections," he added.Read: Tuju's Jubilee secretariat post will not block Raila Nyanza votes, says MP
