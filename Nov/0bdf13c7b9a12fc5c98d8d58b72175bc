Josephine Kabura, the businesswoman in the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal, may have lied in her testimony before the Public Accounts Committee. Initially, the amount lost in the NYS saga was quoted at Sh791 million but the Auditor General s report showed Sh1.6 billion was missing.When she appeared before the watchdog committee on November 1, Kabura, who is accused of masterminding the theft, denied ever knowing her co-accused Ben Gethi prior to her arrest and appearance in court.The committee is chaired by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo.Gumbo: Have you ever met Ben Gethi? Kabura: (hesitates) We met the first time I was arrested.Gumbo: So that is the first time you met Ben Gethi?Kabura: Yeah.Gumbo: You have never met him before?Kabura: Not at all...She said this even as the team investigating the scandal disputed her testimony, claiming she was telling a lie.But in his submission to the committee after his name was adversely mentioned by former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru, DP William Ruto s aide Farouk Kibet has confirmed what may be a link between Gethi and Kabura.Kibet gives an account appearing to show Kabura and Gethi may not have just been acquaintances, but friends.He says that in January 2015, he had requested Sh2 million from Gethi to assist a patient who was going for treatment in India.A firm associated with Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen Sing oe, Murkomen and Sigei Advocates is said to have also received the NYS cash.But yesterday, Murkomen said, I was never mentioned, the question of being invited does not arise. Though Kibet denied ever knowing Kabura, he told the committee he received Sh500,000 from Kabura as part of the loan, despite making the request to Gethi. In March of the same year, he received Sh1 million from Kabura.When the first deposit was made, the balance in his account read Sh7 million, though he claimed he was in need of the Sh2 million. By the time the second deposit was made, his account was reading Sh12.2 million.Kibet had previously told the DCI during questioning the money he had requested from Gethi was for a harambee. How it turned out that the money was for medication is what the PAC will try to find out. Also, how it turned out that Kabura deposited the money in his account without Kibet questioning the nature of her deposits is also for the committee to establish. If Kabura never knew Gethi, why did she make deposits to Kibet s account when it is Gethi who was requested the loan?
