Residents of Kogello village, Siaya county, are a sad lot after Republican Donald Trump (pictured) trounced Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton in the US polls.The residents said the rapid development they achieved in eight years under President Barack Obama s tenure would be hurt. Faith Owino spoke to the Star shortly after Trump s victory speech. Clinton s loss is a big blow to Kogello residents who enjoyed massive development under Obama.Owino said women had anticipated being inspired by Clinton for elective positions perceived to belong to men. Their disappointment comes barely two days after Kogello residents conducted a mock election that depicted Clinton as the 45th US President.Those who were not keen on the impact of Trump s victory in Kogello urged Clinton to accept the outcome of the elections. Some Kogello residents have accepted the results. Owino said they supported Clinton s candidature and her leadership would have led to the continuous transformation of their lives. The residents urged Obama to use his connections and personally transform his ancestral home Kogello. They said on his last trip to Kenya, Obama promised to engage Kogello residents directly when he leaves office.
