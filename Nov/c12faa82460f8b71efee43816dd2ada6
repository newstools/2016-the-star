Residents of Kaniki in Tana River county yesterday expressed anger over the slow humanitarian response by the national and county governments, despite devastating drought. They told the press the county government brought relief food only once. Its water tracking is inadequate and residents sell their emaciated animals at throwaway prices to buy water at exorbitant prices from private vendors.Sadia Ahmed said they sometimes have to skip cooking meals because there is no water to use.She said residents contribute and buy water from private water tanker vendors who charge up to Sh25,000 per tanker or Sh1,000 per 2,000-litre tank.
