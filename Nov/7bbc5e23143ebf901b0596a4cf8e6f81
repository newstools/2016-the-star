MPs are demanding the prosecution of nine interdicted senior police officers for &ldquo;criminal negligence&rdquo; following last year&rsquo;s April deadly terror attack on Garissa University College.Officers interdicted over the attack include Northeastern regional coordinator Ernest Munyi, Garissa county commissioner Njenga Miiri, Garissa AP Commander Christopher Muthee, Garissa DCI boss Musa Yego and county commander Charles Wambugu.Others are Garissa police boss Benjamin Ong&rsquo;ombe, Anti-Terror Police Unit boss Nicholas Kimanzi and subcounty AP boss John Cheruiyot.The top security commanders were sent packing in April last year. The attack was attributed to leadership failure on their part.But a parliamentary committee report to be tabled today proposes the officers be charged with failing to act on numerous intelligence reports prior to the attack that left 148 people, most of them students, dead.The National Assembly Committee on National Security and Administration recommends the suspended police bosses prosecuted for failing to act on terror alerts from Garissa county Intelligence Security Committee to prevent the attack or limit casualties.&ldquo;The government should ensure the interdicted senior administrative officers and police county commanders prosecuted for criminal negligence,&rdquo; the report says.The National Police Service investigation team headed by Northeastern DCI boss Mohamed Amin last year concluded that the officers be charged with similar offence.The committee chaired by Tiaty MP Asman Kamama wants the Recce Squad, which played a key role in ending the attack, decentralised to county headquarters, especially to vulnerable regions.&ldquo;This will reduce the duration taken by the Unit to respond to serious crimes in areas far from Nairobi,&rdquo; the report reads.Recce Squad from Nairobi delayed to respond to the attack due to the problem in securing a chopper from the Kenya Police Service Air Wing.The committee further recommends that the KDF be the last resort in responding to any rescue operation after exhausting services of other relevant security units.
