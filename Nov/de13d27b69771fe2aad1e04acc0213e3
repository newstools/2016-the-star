Sports betting firm, Betway in collaboration with Kenya Premier League side, Mathare United will conduct a four-day training for 16 top players, who were selected after two weekends of trials in Nairobi.The camp at Goan Institute had attracted a total of 1600 players, who were part of the Betway Talent Search. The squad was later whittled down by West Ham sponsored coaches, Josh Evans and Adam Crossley, assisted by Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi and former Harambee Stars captain Dennis Oliech.The 16 players will undergo a four-day all-inclusive training regime that will set the ground work for them, not only in terms of their skill, but will also put emphasis on all the essential ingredients necessary to develop an elite professional football player.They are set to play Mathare United tomorrow at Kasarani with the top player getting a trip to the United Kingdom for a West Ham United match experience. African players are creative and skilful. They are hard-working and perform well in the English Premier League since they are exceptional. At the end of the camp, we intend to unravel the hidden talent among the players, said Adam Crossley, West Ham training analyst. We will focus on developing football, identifying new talent, and exposing an exciting generation of future stars to the international level of the sport, he added. Activities in the camp will include skills development, physical assessment, life skills workshops and games analysis before concluding with the final player selection.
