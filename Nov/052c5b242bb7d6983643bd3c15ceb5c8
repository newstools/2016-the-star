Deputy President William Ruto made a three-day tour of four counties in the North Rift to market Jubilee ahead of a visit by President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kanu and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s Chama Cha Mashinani appear to have gained ground. The DP s tour was aimed at assessing the political ground before Uhuru s tour.Ruto headed to the region after his arrival from Luanda, Angola, on Friday. He started with Elgeyo Marakwet before heading to West Pokot, then Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu.He focused on marketing Jubilee flagship projects, including the Last Mile rural electrification project, achievements in agriculture, healthcare and infrastructure. We have achieved so much that our opponents are scared. Kenyans will now have a clear choice to make between Jubilee and the opposition, whose agenda is to organise demonstrations, Ruto said.He spoke at St Joseph s Kabyemit Catholic Church in Eldoret town.Ruto said Uhuru would visit this month to launch projects, including the upgrading of key health projects like the Ziwa and Burnt Forest subdistrict hospitals in Uasin Gishu.The tour came amid fears that some Jubilee politicians may be left out during nominations. Many aspirants are worried the primaries may not be fair. The President, myself and Jubilee are committed to uniting the country and that is why we have insisted on coming together through one party, the DP said.The absence of some key Ruto allies sparked speculation that they are uncomfortable with the goings on in Jubilee. In Elgeyo Marakwet, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen skipped the DP s function. He is said to have been in China. Ruto asked residents not to fight Murkomen as he is a national leader.
