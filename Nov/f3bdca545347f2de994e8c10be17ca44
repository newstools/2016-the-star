Housing Finance Group plans to develop innovative products as it targets cross-selling to bolster its revenue in the wake of dwindling profit margins as a result interest rate caps. The stand-alone mortgage financier and property developer said in a statement it is expanding &ldquo;banking channels and launch more innovative products as it seeks to make further inroads in the banking sector&rdquo;. HF's net earnings for nine months through September rose by a modest 7.74 per cent to Sh 837.7 million compared with Sh777.5 million the lender made a year earlier. The firm attributed the growth to a 14.81 per cent increase in interest income from loans and government securities to Sh3.1 billion. &ldquo;Revenues from our subsidiaries have been on the rise and this is seen in the profitability during this period,&rdquo; group managing director Frank Ireri said. Subsidiaries include the commercial banking arm HFC, HF Development and Investment for real estate and HF Insurance Agency. Loans to customers increased to Sh53.9 billion from Sh51.7 billion, an almost flat growth of 4.2 per cent year-on-year.Customer deposits, on the other hand, expanded by Sh4 billion to hit Sh41.6 billion pole, largely helped by a rise in retail outlets. &ldquo;Over the nine months, we have been able to substantially grow our footprint across the country and this has enabled us to recruit more customers and in turn grow the loan book as well as mobilise deposits from a larger customer base,&rdquo; said Ireri. The property development and investment arm, HFDI, plans to launch the Sh5 billion entered into Clay City targeting 1,520 apartments along Thika superhighway through joint venture with Clay Works.
