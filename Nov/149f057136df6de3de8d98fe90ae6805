Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i is to be commended for going the extra mile to ensure that the 2016 national examinations are completely aboveboard. Matiang i is among government officials who have supervised the examinations, occasionally practically playing invigilator.He has overseen the administration of the tests, as have the three Principal Secretaries under him and the chairman of the Kenya National Examinations Council. Dr Matiang i and these top bureaucrats are leading from the front in far-flung regions of the country. Their show of concern and efficiency is highly symbolic, given the national shame and tragedy of the exam-cheating epidemic of the last couple of years. The same zeal should apply to ensuring that the marking of the exams is also devoid of corruption and shortcuts. The KCSE exams in particular are prone to corruption at several levels, particularly marking. The determination to get into university sees some parents and candidates pull out all the stops on a life-and-death basis to ensure success by hook and by crook.
