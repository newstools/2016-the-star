Total revenues rose 5.02 per cent to Sh102.10 billion, meaning the listed firm, owned 40 per cent by UK s Vodafone, earned an average of Sh557.97 million daily over the period. Mobile data services posted the largest growth at 46.72 per cent year-on-year to Sh13.40 billion, helped by a 13.7 per cent growth in active customers to 14.9 million, with each spending an average of Sh143.8 per month a 13.7 per cent rise. Chief executive Bob Collymore said the growth in mobile data revenues was also supported by increased use of smartphones and a 16 per cent reduction in the cost of data bundles.Earnings from its globally-successful M-Pesa, which has 24.8 million subscribers, increased by more than a third, rising 33.70 per cent to Sh25.87 billion. This followed a 12.2 per cent rise in active M-Pesa customers to 17.6 million, transacting Sh247.7 each a month, a 14.6 per cent growth. The 26.6 million-subscriber company scrapped fees for sending money person-to-person and making payment through Lipa Na M-Pesa for transactions of up to Sh100, although withdrawal charges still stands.Chief financal officer Sateesh Kamath said the elimination of the charges will cost Safaricom about Sh500 million a year, which is an equivalent of what it earns from transactions of less than Sh100 in a year.Chief executive of Rich Management Aly-Khan Satchu said shareholders have experienced a golden age since Collymore took over with shares rising from Sh3 a piece to Sh21 on Friday. The returns that shareholders have received is in the top percentile of the world. This is the best performance anywhere in the world, Satchu said on the phone. This is a cash machine, and as we move to data-centric economy. I expect them to leverage on that even further. Revenues from call services, despite growing at slowest pace of 1.1 per cent, is still the single largest source of income for Safaricom at Sh45.77 billion, while short messaging services income grew 8.1 per cent to Sh8.63 billion. One per cent growth on a big revenue base is huge, Kamath said.
