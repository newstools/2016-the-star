Lugari MP Ayub Savula (pictured) has said some Cord MPs are undermining ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi s presidential bid . He said two MPs recently went to Mudavadi s residence in Nairobi and asked him to drop his bid and urged him to run instead for Nairobi governor, but he refused. Without naming the politicians, Savula on Thursday said, Asking him to run for governor amounts to belittling him.
