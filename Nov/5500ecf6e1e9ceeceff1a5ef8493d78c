Lugari MP Ayub Savula (pictured) has said some Cord MPs are undermining ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s presidential bid . He said two MPs recently went to Mudavadi&rsquo;s residence in Nairobi and asked him to drop his bid and urged him to run instead for Nairobi governor, but he refused. Without naming the politicians, Savula on Thursday said, &ldquo;Asking him to run for governor amounts to belittling him.&rdquo;
