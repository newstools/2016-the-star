The government will mount a massive crackdown on non-Kenyans employed as madrassa and Duksi teachers in Northeastern, regional coordinator Mohammud Saleh said.He made the announcement on Thursday when he met imams from Garissa county at a peace-building and conflict-resolution forum at the Government Guesthouse.Saleh said most of the schools unprocedurally employ foreigners from Ethiopia and Somalia to teach children.He said some of the teachers have ulterior motives and the government will not take any chances, given the current security threat posed by militant groups. We can t take everything for granted. We have to address the matters as they are, Saleh said. We need to know how they came to Kenya in the first place and who is keeping and habouring them. We don t have a problem with visitors coming to our country, but they must follow procedures. He said being employed as a madrassa teacher is a job like any other and one needs a work permit.In recent months, there have been sporadic terror attacks by al Shabaab militants in the region. They have mainly targeted non-residents.Employers to be chargedThe regional coordinator warned that those who employ and habour such teachers will be held responsible and charged in court. Those who have no papers should take the earliest opportunity and go back to their country before we catch up with them, Saleh said.He urged the imams and other Muslim clerics to work closely with government security agencies. He said the clerics are respected by residents hence, could help deal with terror problems afflicting the region.Saleh was flanked by top security officers from Northeastern. He urged residents to be patriotic and the imams to preach peace and co-existence among various communities and religious groups.
