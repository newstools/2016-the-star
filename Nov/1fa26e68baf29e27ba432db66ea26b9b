Defending yourself loudly in public rallies will never save you in NYS scandal, former IG David Kimaiyo has told Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen.Kimaiyo asked Murkomen to record a statement with the DCI and EACC instead of trying to get public support on the matter."It is shameful to defend yourself in public barazas when your name has been adversely mentioned in corruption. Why should you try to get public support if you are innocent?" Kimaiyo said.More on this: Murkomen denies NYS hired his law firm, says Waiguru affidavit a diversionary tactic"Wananchi will not help you in any way.
