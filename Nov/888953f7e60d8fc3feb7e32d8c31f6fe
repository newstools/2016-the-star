Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma and Nairobi s Evans Kidero have 30 days to respond to an application seeking to stop them from building houses on the shores of Lake Victoria.The two, alongside Environment ministry secretary Alice Kaudia, have been sued for allegedly encroaching on wetlands around the lake. The hearing failed to take place on Tuesday. The suit is filed at a Kisumu court.Michael Nyaguti went to court in 2013 seeking an injunction to restrain them from implementing or further engaging in an any activity or construction work along the lake. He said construction of the houses would likely harm the environment on the disputed wetlands.Nyaguti said the wetlands are on the verge of destruction, a cause of great concern that needs to be addressed as fast as possible. This application should be certified urgent and be heard forthwith in the first instance, reads his application.He had also asked the court to compel Nema to give to him all the information on the environmental impact assessment and any other restriction orders.But lawyer Taremkwa Darius, representing the two governors, told the court his clients were not served with the application. Nyaguti insisted, however, that the defendants as well as Nema, the fourth defendant in the case, were served with copies of the application.Kisumu Land and Environment judge Stephen Kibunja directed the defendants to file a response to the application within 30 days. But Taremkwa said that would be highly unlikely as they are sitting governors with many duties.The judge dismissed the argument and said they can easily sign an affidavit. Nyaguti was told to serve Nema with the new hearing date, which was set for January 23.
