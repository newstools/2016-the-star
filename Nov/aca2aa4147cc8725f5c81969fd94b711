Ten clerks at the judiciary face the sack after allegedly using forged KCSE exam certificates to get employed.Mid this year, the judiciary employed 916 clerks. Of the number, 10 were found to have presented forged KCSE exam certificates.Judiciary Director of Public Affairs and Communication Naim Bilal told the Star yesterday the Kenya National Examination Council has confirmed the certificates of the 10 are fake. The individuals were hired in July. The affected persons have been notified and have been given an opportunity to respond, he said. Bilal said the judiciary s disciplinary committee will meet this month to discuss the individual cases and make recommendations.The discovery means that the judiciary undertook post-employment verification of the 916 certificates, rather than doing it before hiring. Bilal said the verification and authentication of academic and professional papers is a standard and necessary practice in government to support the principle of merit in public job opportunities.The judiciary is also awaiting a Knec verification report on 10 more pending cases for individuals suspected to have submitted forged certificates to get clerical jobs.The clerical job applicants were supposed to have a qualification of KCSE exam s C- (minus) grade.In April, police in Nairobi raided a cartel that was printing fake certificates in Ndaragwa House, Mfangano Street. Among the documents found at the premises were fake KCSE exam, degree, birth and police clearance certificates.Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome said, An undercover police officer walked into the premises and left with a BA in Criminology and Security Studies after paying Sh20,000. He urged employers to verify the authenticity of certificates presented to them by job-seekersand those applying for admission toinstitutions of higher learning.
