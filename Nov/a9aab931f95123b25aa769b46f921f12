Juja MP Francis Waititu has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to transfer Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich. He said Rotich is an obstacle to development and the Jubilee administration s transformation agenda. Rotich is letting down the President by failing to release development funds on time. There is somebody else he is listening to, not the President, Waititu said. He said Rotich has gone against Uhuru s request to release funds for the construction of additional footbridges on Thika Road. Waititu accused the CS of not releasing funds for the second and third phases of the highway.The two phases would have included the construction of footbridges in urban areas along the highway.Parliament last year approved a petition by the MP seeking funds for the construction of footbridges in Juja town. Waititu said Rotich has let down the President by refusing to comply with Parliament s decision on his petition and a presidential order. He said pedestrians are losing lives on the highway.
