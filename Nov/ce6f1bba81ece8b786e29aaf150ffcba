If the information in the public domain so far concerning the Afya House scandal in the ministry of Health is anything to go by, then it is one of the biggest scams on the Jubilee administration s watch.Conflicting reports from Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri on the one hand and internal auditor Bernard Muchere on the other are worrying. Muchere, a certified fraud examiner, insists the ministry cannot account for Sh5.2 billion. Mailu and Muraguri acknowledge queries on only Sh3.2 billion and assert it s accounted for. He has stood by the findings of his interim audit even before the same committee of Parliament that grilled the CS and PS. The plot thickens: A second investigation by Parliament is now beset by accusations that its chairman and his deputy on the Health committee are out to derail the probe. Parliament, the voice of the people, should not allow itself to be used to cover up a great crime.
