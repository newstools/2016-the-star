A Kiambu legislator yesterday defended President Uhuru Kenyatta s withdrawal of the KDF troops from war-torn South Sudan and its withdrawal from the peace process.Lari MP Mburu Kahangara said the President does not need any political advice to send or withdraw troops on a mission. He said the decision to withdraw the Kenya Defence Force soldiers was made by the National Security Committee. He said Uhuru has not bypassed Parliament, as claimed by opposition leader Raila Odinga and others.The troop withdrawal follows the sacking of Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki. He was dismissed by the UN as head of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan after a UN report said he was responsible for failure to come to the aid of nearby aid workers who were attacked, some killed and raped by soldiers.Speaking in Kimende town, Kahangara told the opposition to stop politicising the withdrawal of troops, since it involves the national security. Even if he is the commander-in-chief, that does not mean he does what he likes. He consults on matters involving the national security, the MP said.Kahangara said the South Sudan issue should not be discussed in public rallies.He said most opposition leaders have at one time or the other held senior government positions and they know the threat of exposing the government security to the enemies. When we discuss such issues publicly and start accusing each other before our enemies, they can take advantage of the situation, which is very dangerous. He called the opposition irresponsible.
