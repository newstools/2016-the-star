Jubileee Party leader Uhuru Kenyatta turned its inaugural NGC meeting into a personal attack on Cord leader Raila Odinga, calling him "backward and petty."The President, who did not call Raila by name in his entire address at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi, said the opposition chief thrives on propaganda and lies. He took issue with Raila's claims on the Sh6.8 billion Northern Water Collector Tunnel project and allegations of a Sh5.3 billion scandal at the Health ministry.The water project funded by the World Bank seeks to divert water from sources in the Aberdares to Thika's Ndakaini Dam for use in Nairobi.Raila said on October 10 that he wanted it stopped as it is a "secret, ridiculous" Jubilee initiative. He also said it will turn counties into deserts.Read: Jubilee's Sh6.8bn secret water project will turn counties to deserts - RailaBut Uhuru gave him a severe tongue-lashing, saying: "You must understand a man and his thinking of his backwardness and pettiness... pettiness... pettiness...""He thrives on division of Kenyans and poverty. Uwanja wake ni wa matope (His field is muddy). We will not divert from our objectives," he further said.The Jubilee Party leader, who seemed angry and irritated by the Cord leader, said his coalition will not be dragged into the mud."Wacha aendelee na matope yake sisi tuendelee na maendeleo (Let him carry on with his mud while we carry on with development).""Hataki (He does not want) competition," he further told a cheering crowd in a mixture of English and Kiswahili.Uhuru further said the project was started while Raila was Prime Minister and that the opposition chief's intention was to win votes in Murang'a but haiwezekani (it is not possible)".,He continued: "Lakini mganga hawezi kuona haya.. yake ni vile ataincite wanainchi ili wakasirike, si kuwapea suluhu, kwa sababu hiyo ndio siasa yake."This loosely translates to: "A wizard has no shame... His goal is to cause citizens to be angry, not to give them solutions, because that is type of politicking."Raila claimed Jubilee conceptualised, commissioned and commenced construction of the water tunnel without establishing its impact on the environment.Read: Athi board says Murang'a project won't reduce water levels in riversHe added that it will be one of the most disastrous initiatives as it will turn Muranga, Garissa, Ukambani and Tana River Delta regions into deserts, within five years of completion.But Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wairia asked Raila to stop using the project as a campaign tool.Read: Raila using water project to gain political points, Wairia says, defends JubileeAlso read: Work on Kenya s biggest water tunnel to begin
