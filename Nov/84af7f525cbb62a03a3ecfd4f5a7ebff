"Upholding the will of the people by giving everybody a chance is the best form of democracy," he said."Despite the dirty campaign bordering on character assassination, the candidates addressed issues dear to Americans."Mudavadi noted that Trump "won from nowhere" despite not being given a chance by "media pundits" across the world."(Trump was given) no chance of electability even as he zoomed through the Republican Party primaries without the support of the party," he said. "Opinion polls equally gave Trump no chance."The bizarre ending to Clinton s political career came after Trump confounded pollsters at every turn, capturing one 'swing' state after another in a line of toppled dominoes that stretched across three time zones and now ends at the White House.Amid cheers from the crowd, Trump gave a speech that left many of his supporters giggling and laughing their hearts out."Ours was not a campaign but a movement. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough!" he said.More on this: I will be president for all Americans, Trump says after election win
