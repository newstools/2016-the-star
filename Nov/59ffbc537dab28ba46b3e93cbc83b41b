Our people suffer due to lack of leadership, it is that missing leadership which I will provide, Ngilu said.She spoke at the Kimangao Catholic Church in Mwingi North, Kitui county, during a funds drive in aid of the Catholic Women Association in Kimangao parish. She was hosted by parish priest Fr Paul Ng oku and area MP John Munuve.Improve agricultureNgilu said as governor she will ensure provision of water for irrigation and homes in all parts of the county.She wants to mechanise agriculture to end the vicious cycle of recurrent famine. The former CS added that she will ensure women are economically empowered and eliminate poverty through job creation. Kitui is also endowed with resources that do not benefit locals. We have fruits like mangoes, farm yields, livestock, honey and others products that benefit outsiders. I will ensure value addition to Kitui products to fetch high prices in the market, Ngilu said.Munuve, who recently defected from Wiper to Jubilee Party, said he will support Ngilu in the race for governor. I have in the past worked with her and I have no doubt she has the interest of the people at heart, he said. Munuve also said he is certain he will be reelected, despite him ditching Wiper the perceived popular party in the region. I have done a lot for the people of Mwingi North. I am sure they will not vote on party lines but re-elect me on the basis of my track record, he said.
