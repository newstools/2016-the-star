There was tension in the air when sworn foes Embu Governor Martin Wambora and Senator Lenny Kivuti met at the University of Embu on Saturday.The two sat side-by-side during the installation of Prof Paul Musili as the chancellor of the new institution. The two did not utter a word to each other, despite sitting together for hours. Kivuti will run for governor.Wambora at times looked in the opposite direction, sometimes buried himself in what appeared to be mobile phone conversations and other times just looked straight ahead. Kivuti conversed with Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi, who was seated to his left. The two would sometimes break into laughter while Wambora just looked straight ahead.Consultant Kithinji Kiragu sat in the second row and remained quiet. He will battle it out for the Jubilee Party ticket with Kivuti and Wambora.The three have not met for months. They have held rallies separately, criticising eachother.The other aspirant &ndash; Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire &ndash; did not attend the event.Musili was a commissioner with the Kenya Law Reform Commission between 2000 and 2005. Musili has served as a member of the task force on performance contracting.During his speech, Wambora promised to give the chancellor a conducive environment to run the university and partner in development projects.Kivuti also said he will support the university. He praised leaders who fought for its establishment including Mbarire, former Manyatta legislator Emilio Kathuri, Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi and Cardinal John Njue.He called for peaceful campaigns for governor and other political positions.
