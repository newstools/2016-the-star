The sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha were dealt a blow on Thursday when their application to stop extradition proceedings was rejected by a Mombasa court. Chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea said the court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. This was the third time the application by Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha was being rejected.The proceedings have gone on for two years now but witnesses are yet to testify.The defence has argued that Kenya lacks jurisdiction to entertain the extradition request and has no agreement with the US on the exchange of crime suspects.The team has also said the country's courts are capable of trying the crimes the suspects are accused of.Baktash and Ibrahim were charged with drug trafficking alongside Indian Vijaygiri Goswami and Pakistani Gulam Hussein."The application made by the four suspected drug traffickers has been dismissed and l hereby order that the matter will be heard and determined in the Kenyan courts in accordance with the constitution," ruled Nang ea.He added that the case will proceed to full trial before the suspects are handed over to the US government.Nang ea warned the suspects against skipping court saying they risked the cancellations of their bonds.Read: Court summons Akasha sons for delaying extradition caseThe four suspects were arrested by Kenyan and US detectives at the Akashas' Nyali home on November 10, 2014, after a New York judge issued a warrant.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti said Kenya was relying on a colonial-era agreement between the United Kingdom and the US to extradite the four, who are facing drug trafficking charges.Muteti argued that the treaty signed in 1931 was binding on the part of Kenya, which was a British colony at the time.But the defence denounced the treaty as redundant and non-binding on independent Kenya. The team said the agreement lapsed after independence and that Kenya has not sought any such deal with the US since 1963.The Akashas and the two others were indicted on drug trafficking charges, for allegedly plotting to import 96kg of heroin and other narcotics. The indictment states that US detectives lured them by posing as customers from South America during a sting operation in Nyali.Baktash and Ibrahim s father Akasha Abdalla was killed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, about 20 years ago in what has been linked to his international drugs deals.
