Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo (pictured) has said he will make sure Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga is not reelected if he does not account for Sh24 million allocated to the county over four years.He said Rasanga does not have a single project to speak of. The amount he has received in the past four years of devolution was never allocated to the former Nyanza province, but there was development, Midiwo said. He spoke at Rembe Primary School, Gem, on Friday.
