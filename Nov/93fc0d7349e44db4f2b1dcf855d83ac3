Opposition leader Raila Odinga has reiterated that he did not 'fix' DP William Ruto at the ICC to cause him to lose Kalenjin's support during elections.The former Prime Minister said the allegations against him were orchestrated so he could lose votes."I didn't take Ruto to Thee Hague... I was shocked when I heard this," he said at Kabiyet Boys High School in Nandi county on Saturday, during the burial ceremony of former North Rift Kanu chairperson Sarah Saina.The Cord leader said there was no way he could frame a member of his own camp."Ruto was my man and everybody knows that violence broke in Nairobi, Kericho, Eldoret and Kisumu. How could have I framed him? asked Raila.He gave the explanations in a bid to clear his name, saying he will seek the region's support in the next general eelction set for August 8, 2017."The one who came up with the propaganda was aiming to discredit me ahead of the elections. It was wrong but here I am again," he said.Raila was criticised by several Jubilee leaders over the DP's case at the International Criminal Court.The President told him off for remarks he issued in France deploring the collapse of the Kenyan ICC cases.Raila, during an interview with France 24 in Paris, said the ICC allowed itself to be blackmailed by Kenya through the African Union, with the idea that states will pull out because of trials against their leaders.More on this: Uhuru tells off Raila over ICC blackmail statementsElgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen siad the collapse of Ruto's case left Raila a "bitter" man."Finally the man speaks his heart...
