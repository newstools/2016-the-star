Chief Justice David Maraga has cautioned magistrates against dragging cases under their jurisdiction.The Supreme Court president said in Mumias on Thursday that the Judiciary will not accept cases to run for more than one year.Maraga made the comments when he made an impromptu visit to Mumias law court. The CJ is on a tour of courts in Western. He said it was unfortunate that some cases have been running for over five years.Maraga made stops at Butere before leaving for Bungoma where he was destined.In Mumias, Maraga was shown around the court compound before he visited both the juvenile and adult cells.He exchanged pleasantries with suspects who were waiting for court proceedings of their cases.The CJ observed that the courts were too small to accommodate members of the public who throng courtrooms for proceedings."The judiciary will be working towards expanding the size of the courtrooms not only in Mumias but across the country," said Maraga.Mumias senior principal magistrate Teresa Odera informed the CJ that civil cases are not moving because of the small number of magistrates."We are only three magistrates in Mumias. We have cases dated back to 2007. The backlog is overwhelming," Odera said. The absence of a lands judge in Kakamega county was highlighted as one of the major contributor to the backlog.The CJ said his intention is to have cases determined within a very short period of time."While the state pushes me to work expeditiously on court cases, I will be pushing magistrates to determine cases within a short period of time," he said."We don t want a scenario where cases run for over 10 years," the CJ said, after he was briefed by the public that cases drag due to missing files.He told court staff to be cautious while handling case files so that suspects don t suffer in custody because of mistakes of the judiciary.Read: Children's cases will be dispensed in 6 months - Martha Koome
