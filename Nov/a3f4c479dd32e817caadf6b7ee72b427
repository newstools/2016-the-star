A night guard was detained following the theft of an ATM and a safe loaded with cash at Equity Bank in Kayole on Saturday.The Jamka Security Services staff member, identified only as Mwangi, was arrested on Monday.He was guarding the premises next to the bank which lost an unknown amount of money in the incident.Police said investigations revealed the burglars gained entry to the bank through the premises "in a well-schemed and perfectly executed theft".They then drilled a hole in the bank's wall without the knowledge of the Wells Fargo security guards manning the premises.The guards reportedly did not know of the incident until 11am on Sunday when detectives from Kayole visited the scene.Neither neighbours nor watchmen around the area heard any commotion at the time of the burglary.Hillary Gatimo, the caretaker of the building next to the bank, said the alarm bell rang that evening but that they did not see the reason why."I was here at around 8pm when the alarm went off. Everyone was here... We did not suspect anything. The guards said they had not noticed anything," said Gatimo."On Sunday, my daughter called at about 11am to tell me there were many police officers outside the premises."The house that borders the bank's wall has been under lock and key since October when a man rented it saying he would open a photocopy shop."Police in the company of the bank manager broke the door into the house only to find that a section of the wall adjacent to the bank's rear wall had been partly demolished," said the caretaker.Gliders, a gas cylinder, mallets and chisels were found at the bank's hall next to the two safes that were shattered."I rented the premises to an optician two years ago. I did not know he subdivided and sublet a section to the man who wanted to run a photocopy shop," said Gatimo.A worker at the optician's shop was among several people questioned by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Kayole.Area police boss Joseph Gichangi said they found the bank's CCTV disabled and the alarm system deactivated.It is not clear whether the bank's staff members or the burglars were responsible for turning off the cameras and alarm bells.Gichangi said Mwangi had not been charged as the bank's official's had not reconciled records to establish how much money was stolen.Read: Robbers break into Kayole Equity Bank, steal ATM machine with cash
