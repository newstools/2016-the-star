Embu Governor Martin Wambora is one difficult person to work with, his former advisers have said. Bosco Kiura, Joe Kamaria and Joshua Kanake said residents should treat Wambora like a spoiled child whose parents gave up and gave birth to another one. In Embu tradition we say that if parents get a child but he is spoiled such that they are unable to correct him, the best thing to do is just to give birth to another one, Kanake said.The three were fired by Wambora in September. Kanake was his political adviser, Kamaria was his economic and planning adviser while Kiura was his personal adviser and liaison officer.On Saturday they joined 2,000 elders in Kairuri grounds in Embu North sub-county to endorse Senator Lenny Kivuti for governor. Kanake and Kamaria said they did their best to advise the governor on governance but he would not listen to them.Kanake apologised for serving Wambora. He said the three of them are very disappointed with him for failing the people of Embu. They urged residents to consider Kivuti the newborn who will replace the spoiled one.The elders were fulfilling a promise to lead the community in endorsing Kivuti. Some 39 Mbeere community subclans endorsed Kivuti at the Kwa Rumbia holy shrine in Mbeere North on October 22.
