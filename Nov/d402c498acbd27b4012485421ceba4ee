Mandera residents will have access to tapped water once the Sh2.8 billion storage project is completed in April next year, county officials have said. The project is a partnership between the Mandera government and the African Development Bank.County water chief Mohamud Issack yesterday said the facility will provide water to more than 69,000 households. The facility will be instrumental in ending the water crisis and the human-animal conflict, he said.Elwak town will be the first county to get water. Many people have died of waterborne diseases for lack of clean water. We are determined to put to an end the agony of waterborne diseases and provide the community with fresh drinking water because the water here is too salty, Mohamud said.He said the county will use tracking technology to identify areas with fresh water.Bulla Haji is one of the towns in Mandera East identified for connection to tapped water. All the other centres from Border Point 1 to Hareri have similar water projects, Mohamud said.He said the county will drill 18 boreholes and construct 27 dams across the county.Mohamud said reverse osmosis will be used in Elwak and Wargadud to end the recurring water problem.Mandera residents have previously had to trek to Elwak 120km away to get clean water. The human-animal crisis has been a huge problem in Mandera, with many residents being injured.
