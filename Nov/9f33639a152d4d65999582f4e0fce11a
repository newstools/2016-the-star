A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate.The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe.A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic.She campaigned on Thursday in the battleground state of Florida, where she was joined in Dade City by former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump had mocked for gaining weight. Chants of Lock her up! from dozens of Trump supporters gathered nearby could be faintly heard while Clinton spoke.Trump and other Republicans have seized on Comey's announcement, which did not indicate any wrongdoing by Clinton, to ratchet up criticism of the Democratic candidate. She leads in most opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election.Trump urged people on Tuesday who voted early for his Democratic rival to cancel their ballots and switch to him."This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and who are having a bad case of buyer's remorse, in other words you want to change your vote," Trump told a Wisconsin rally a week before the Nov. 8 election. So if you live here or in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota, you can change your vote to Donald Trump, he added.Several states, including those cited by Trump, have a process to allow voters who cast early ballots to change their votes, either by submitting new ballots or showing up at their polling place on Election Day.
