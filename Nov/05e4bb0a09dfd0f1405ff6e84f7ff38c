A meeting has been called today to discuss planned demolition of five estates in Starehe constituency to make way for high-rise apartments.The county plans to demolish one-storey houses in various parts of the city and put up multi-storey houses to accommodate more people.The meeting to discuss the planned demolitions was called after residents petitioned area MP Maina Kamanda to intervene and have the project stopped until their concerns are addressed.He told the Star yesterday that he met Governor Evans Kidero and agreed to hold a meeting with the residents representatives to answer their concerns.This follows a meeting with Kamanda on Wednesday, where more than 200 residents said the county has not committed to compensate them and there is no assurance they will be allocated houses once the project is completed.Didn t involve our leadersThey said their leaders, including the area MP and MCA, have not been involved in the negotiations despite the magnitude of the project. Why is the county doing things in secret? I am the area MP and I have not been involved. The other day they signed contracts and none of us, including the representatives of the affected tenants, was invited, Kamanda said.Jeevanjee, Bachelor Quarters, Pangani, Old and New Ngara, all in Starehe constituency, have been identified for demolition to pave way for high-rise buildings.We want written pactResident Patrick Musau said City Hall is reluctant to commit in writing the relocation plans and how they will be compensated. We have never signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the county because every time they call us, we get a different document, he said.Residents said they are panicked, living in fear of eviction.On Tuesday, the county awarded Sh61.5 billion contracts to seven private investors, which included financial institutions and real estate firms, to re-develop the estates.Kidero said residents will be paid for relocation and 24 months rent for the period the projects will be undertaken.In the first phase of the Sh300 billion redevelopment project, 10,200 housing units will be built to accommodate about 100,000 people. It is part of the County Comprehensive Urban Renewal Programme.The five run-down estates have about 200 houses.
