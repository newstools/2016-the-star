Shelter Afrique yesterday launched 5,000 for 5,000 Home Competition aimed at spurring discussions on affordable housing for the urban poor. It seeks to showcase new housing concepts. Participants, of whom winners will take home $100,000 (Sh10.18 million), will be required to propose a design for a one-bedroom unit measuring approximately 45 square metres with a kitchen, bedroom, toilet and living area. It should be made from eco-friendly light-weight materials that are low-cost. Shelter Afrique will finance the 5,000 units using the winning concept.
