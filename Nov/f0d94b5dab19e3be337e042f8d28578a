Jubilee coalition has questioned Cord leader Raila Odinga's stand on the fight against runaway corruption in counties following his decision to defend governors from his coalition.Led by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, the MPs ridiculed Raila's criticism of Jubilee government on corruption while he defended Cord leaders implicated in the loss of millions in counties."His double standards spell doom for citizens in ODM-controlled counties. It is evident that Raila will not only condone corruption there but also spare no effort to defend those participating in it," Duale said on Wednesday.Raila while responding to Sh1.4 billion loss in Kilifi County defended Governor Amason Kingi saying the matter was just audit queries raised from preliminary audit reports."It is immensely difficult to believe that this is the same Raila who has gone hammer and tongs against government institutions on the basis of draft interim audit reports, striving to portray the government in bad light," he said.[VIDEO] Raila defends Cord governors, says corruption audit biasedRaila came out strongly demanding President Uhuru Kenyatta to account for the alleged Sh5.2 billion scandal in Health ministry revealed by an interim audit report."When it comes to his associates, Raila suddenly detects a distinction between preliminary and final audit reports. It is sad indeed that the war on graft has been infiltrated by charlatans, hypocrites and poachers dressed as gamekeepers," Duale said.The legislators maintained that every governor whether from Jubilee or Cord should be held responsible for money lost in counties.More on this: [Statement] Raila 'suspiciously tolerant' of county corruption - State HouseAuditor general Edward Ouko's audit reports for 2014-/5 financial year reveals the shocking loss of millions in taxpayers' money in counties through procurement, irregular salary payments, foreign and local travels, among other suspicious spending.Duale said Raila cannot be trusted to champion the fight against corruption and claimed that the Cord leader is receives a monthly stipend from all ODM bound counties."His innumerable trips, collossal entourages both in Kenya and abroad are funded by county governments led by governors from his party. Even during his current tour in Coast, the hotel he stays, rallies and air tickets are funded by Kingi and Mombasa governor Hassan Joho," he said.Duale added that Raila's Coast tour is due to panic following Jubilee's last weekend successful rally led by Deputy President William Ruto.He said the rally which attracted huge crowd has given Raila "sleepless nights" and affirmed that Coast is no longer the opposition's stronghold.MPs present at the press conference include Naomi Shabaan (Taveta), Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi woman representative), Johnson Sakaja (nominated), Sonia Birdi (nominated), Alice Wahome (Kandara), Bowen Kangogo (Elgeyo Marakwet), Soipan Tuya (Narok woman representative), among others.
