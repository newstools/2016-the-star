The newly elected Kenya Sitting Volleyball Federation has pledged to develop the sport country wide by introducing it in special schools.Polycarp Mboya beat Duncan Karanja and Joseph Ndung u in a federation s presidential re-run a week ago, after the latter s election was nullified by the Sports Dispute Tribunal. The former national team player said that this will be a good platform to spot talent for the future amongst children living with disability of the legs. There is so much that persons living with disabilities can offer this country and through sports, we can participate in building the nation. During my first term in office, and together with my administration, we want to put up proper development structures starting from the age-group levels. As it stands, there are no development structures for nurturing talents, said Mboya, who is already in talks with the administrations of few special schools around the country.Acknowledging that it is a tough task, Mboya who has previously played with the Muthurua Sitting Volleyball club added: Introducing para-volley in primary and secondary schools will be a big leap for the sport. We want to have players learn the basics of the game and be used to the conditions in the play field such that by the time the boys and girls attain the senior ranks, they are well polished, Currently, 90 per cent of the para-volley clubs are funded by county governments and have no structured feeder programs.
