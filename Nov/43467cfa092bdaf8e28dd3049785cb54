The Isiolo government is encouraging the digging of latrines and using them appropriately to ensure the county is an open defecation-free area by February next year, Governor Godana Doyo has said.This will prevent the spread of diseases caused by poor hygiene and faecal-oral transmission.He spoke on Saturday during a function to mark the World Toilet Day. The event was briefly disrupted by heavy rain and officials were forced a change the venue from the stadium to a social hall.Unicef Chief of Wash for Kenya Andrew Trevett said more than 9,000 children in Kenya die before reaching the age of five years every year because of diarrhoea.In 2009-10, at least 18 children died in Isiolo due to diarrhoea, he said.It is unacceptable to lose such a high number of lives to diarrhoea and other related causes even after 160 years of knowledge of the adverse effects of poor sanitation, Trevett said.He said defecation in the open promotes poor sanitation and can lead to the spread of diseases.Trevett lauded the Isiolo government for launching the 100-day rapid result initiative to ensure that the county is declared an open defecation-free environment by February.Doyo said poor sanitation greatly contributes to the overall health situation in the county. It is important to work with communities to ensure that they are protected from avoidable diseases, he said.Sanitation is a priority for the county government, Doyo said, adding that only one per cent of the population in Isiolo town are connected to the sewerage system.
