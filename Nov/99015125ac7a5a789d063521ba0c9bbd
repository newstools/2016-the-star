ANC deputy party leader Abdi Yarre yesterday accused the Jubilee administration of abetting corruption by failing to prosecute those implicated.He said the blamegame and rhetoric by top Jubilee leaders will not help in the war on corruption. Yarre spoke in Garissa town while popularising his run for Garissa Township MP.He said it s only President Uhuru Kenyatta who has the powers to end corruption. The people of Garissa and Kenyans are sending a very strong message to the President and Deputy President William Ruto. We are tired of this blamegame over corruption. Kenyans cannot stand this merger of corruption and inefficiencies in all public institutions, Yarre said.He said the Jubilee administration has failed to tackle corruption in major institutions and Kenyans have the chance to choose leaders, who are ready and bold enough to fight corruption. If the President fails to walk the talk, then Kenyans have no option but to vote his government out, Yarre said.
