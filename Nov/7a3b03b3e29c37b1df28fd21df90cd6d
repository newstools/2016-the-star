US President-elect Donald Trump has said he will deport or jail up to three million illegal migrants initially.Those targeted would be migrants with criminal records, such as gang members and drug dealers, he told US broadcaster CBS in an interview.He also confirmed that another election promise, to build a wall with Mexico, still stood but could include fencing.The Republican defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential vote.His victory shocked many who had expected Mrs Clinton to win following favourable opinion polls.Trump is due to take over at the White House on 20 January, when Barack Obama steps down after two terms in office.Both houses of Congress are also under Republican control. The US-Mexico border is about 1,900 miles (3,100 km) long and traverses all sorts of terrain from empty, dusty desert to the lush and rugged surroundings of the Rio Grande.It is one of the busiest borders in the world, with at least one million people using it each day, as well as 400,000 cars and 15,000 lorries, according to Mexico's El Universal newspaper.Some 650 miles are covered already by a non-continuous series of fences, concrete slabs and other structures.Trump has previously said his wall would cover 1,000 miles and natural obstacles would take care of the rest.
