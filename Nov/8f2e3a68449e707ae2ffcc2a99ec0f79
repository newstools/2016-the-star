The Central Bank s Monetary Policy Committee has retained its key lending rate at 10 per cent.During its bimonthly meeting yesterday, the MPC said the rate needed no further action, as inflation is expected to remain within the government s target range of between 2.5 and 7 per cent. Given the prevailing domestic and global economic uncertainties and the need for more conclusive information on development, the MPC decided to retain the Central Bank Rate, chairman Patrick Njoroge said in a statement.The CBR is the reference rate for pricing loans under the new law. The MPC meets every two months to determine Kenya s fiscal policy. The MPC set the rate, technically known as the Central Bank Rate, at 10 per cent in September, after effecting a 50 basis points cut from 10.5 per cent, which had prevailed since May.The MPC, which met for the second time after the enactment of the Banking Act Amendment Bill, 2015, said it was not possible to determine the impact of interest rate capping on monetary policy and the overall economy. The committee observed that private sector credit growth stabilised at 4.6 per cent in October. The slower growth witnessed over the past several months was found to be largely an outcome of structural factors in the banking sector, rather than monetary policy. There is no evidence this is having a negative impact on economic growth, it said.
