Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero was for the second time in three months put to task over the poor business environment in the city.The Kenya Private Sector Alliance complained to the city boss about traffic congestion, double taxation, street urchins, garbage, hawkers and illegal structures.Businessman Chris Kirubi and Kepsa chief executive Carole Kariuki engaged the governor in a heated debate after the city boss blamed political interests for the problems businesses face.Kirubi asked Kidero not to use politics to justify failure but to work to make the city conducive for business."Do your work and stop blaming politics, there is no politics in cleaning the city," he said.The businessman asked the governor to explain the county's failure to expand existing markets and establish new ones to accommodate the growing number of street vendors.When Trade executive Anne Othoro rose to answer him, Kirubi demanded that he only be answered by the governor.&ldquo;I have been engaging you many times and nothing has changed,&rdquo; he said.In August, the Nairobi Business Membership Organisations Coalition complained to the governor against the poor business environment in the cityKidero said the county in partnership with the World Bank is renovating and constructing new markets at a cost of Sh6 billion."Westlands Market will be complete in eight weeks. We are re-constructing City Park Market, which will accommodate many traders, and we are also working on Muthurwa, Karandini market on Jogoo Road, Dagoretti Market and City Market," he said.Kidero said political interference is to blame for traffic jams in Nairobi. He said the President gave an order allowing 14-seater matatus in the city and they are the leading cause of traffic congestion in the CBD.Police have also refused to move stop controlling traffic despite traffic control being devolved, the governor said. Wanjiku Manyara of the Petroleum Institute of East Africa said illegal structures erected next to business premises pose a security threat and businesspeople are spending a lot of money to hire security personnel. The county&rsquo;s failure to harmonise taxes has led to double taxation which lead to losses, she said.&ldquo;For example, we pay the county for billboard ads at the same time we pay Kenha. The same is happening in branding," Manyara added.
