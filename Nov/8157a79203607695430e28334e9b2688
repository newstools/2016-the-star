Tharaka Nithi nurses have vowed not to relent as their strike entered its second week. On Tuesday they held peaceful demonstrations in Chuka town, where they marched from the town centre to the Chuka General Hospital. Patients visiting public facilities were turned away as there was nobody to attend to them. Chuka Hospital remained closed.
