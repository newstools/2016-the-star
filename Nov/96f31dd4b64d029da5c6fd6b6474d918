The people of Turkana and West Pokot knew that both the President his deputy were visiting Turkana and West Pokot and that is why they came out in big numbers to receive them, she said.&ldquo;The governor mobilised ODM MCAs to attend the launch of road construction in Kainuk. Some of his MCAs were on a mission to disrupt the event but failed,&rdquo; Emanikor said.She said Ruto did not incite residents against the county government. &ldquo;The DP only asked if the people knew where county funds go and the acclamation was a big no.&rdquo;
