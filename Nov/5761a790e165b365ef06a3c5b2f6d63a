Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said no one owes him a debt for teaming up with President Uhuru Kenyatta to form the Jubilee government. He told Jubilee supporters to concentrate on the general election and ensure the Jubilee Party wins more than 70 per cent of the votes.Ruto said his 2022 presidential bid should not distract Jubilee supporters from the objective of winning the election by a landslide. He said God will decide who wins the 2022 election. The important thing for us is to win the 2017 election, Ruto said. He said Kenyans owe each other the responsibility to foster unity and friendship. It is not you who owes me a debt. It is all of us Kenyans who owe each other the debt of friendship, unity and brotherhood, Ruto said. He spoke at a church function on Nairobi s Zimmerman Estate.Ruto was responding after MPs said Central Kenya will vote for him in 2022 as payback for teaming up with Uhuru in the March 4, 2013, general election. What we want is a united and prosperous Kenya, he said. Ruto said the Jubilee government and its supporters are proud of the administration s achievements in three years. The work we have done as Jubilee is work we are proud of and we are focused on delivering on the agreement we have with Kenyans based on the Jubilee manifesto, he said.
