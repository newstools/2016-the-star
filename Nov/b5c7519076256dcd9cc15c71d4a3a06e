Narc- Kenya party leader Martha Karua has claimed that there is a scheme by the government to cover up the Sh5 billion scandal at the ministry of health.Addressing the media at the party offices in Nairobi, the former justice minister demanded the immediate resignation of Health CS Cleopa Mailu and his PS Nicholas Muraguri, and called for a forensic audit of the scandal and the ministry's expenditures since 2014. We find the conflicting statements by the CS disappointing, inconsistent and symptomatic of grand cover up including his indication to hire at the public expense, a private external audit of the monies in question, Karua said.She added; the auditor general has only one client- the government of Kenya. The Narc- Kenya party leader demanded the full disclosure on when and by whom the decision to procure mobile clinics in this grand heist was made as well as the tendering process including valuation report, decision making and non- successful bids.Karua also noted that the discovery of the scandal is not new, but it is the amounts that indicate a deteriorating and deepening of the crisis of integrity in the country's top most leadership.The remarks by the former justice minister comes as Information, Communication and Technology Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru filed a complaint with the Media Council of Kenya saying that reporting of the matter depicted the government as corrupt.However, Karua warned against attempts to silence the whistle blowers among them the media. The theft is heartless abuse of public monies meant to improve the health of Kenyans especially the pregnant women, young children and other disadvantaged Kenyans. She also proposed online publication of wealth declaration forms of all state officers and the review of strategies in key institutions of the criminal justice system- investigative, prosecution and judiciary.She also wants procurement information in all government agencies and departments at the national and county levels be made public and accessible if to curb the vice.
