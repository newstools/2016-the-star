Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi (pictured) has asked the Law Society of Kenya to join the opposition in removing President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee administration from power. He spoke during an LSK dinner in Nakuru.Mudavadi told the lawyers to stop sitting on the fence and instead join Kenyans in agitating for meaningful change. &ldquo;If you live in Kenya, you cannot plead ignorance of what is the greatest rip-off of people by this administration,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi said the ballooning public debt, rising youth unemployment and Jubilee&rsquo;s misplaced priorities will lead the country to socioeconomic destruction.&ldquo;At the national level, we are missing it when this administration embarks on a reckless borrowing spree for turnkey projects that have increased government borrowing to unsustainable levels. We each carry a debt of Sh79,000 courtesy of a government of rent seekers,&rdquo; he said.The ANC leader is pushing for the creation of the National Super Alliance &ndash; an coalition of all opposition parties, among them Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Wiper and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s Ford Kenya &ndash; to effectively remove Jubilee from power.On Sunday, the Amani leader was among a group of leaders who attended a thanksgiving rally for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, who fell out with Jubilee and formed his Chama Cha Mashinani party. Mudavadi said runaway corruption &ldquo;is intolerable&rdquo;.&ldquo;The law charges LSK with the fate of the Constitution of Kenya. You are the Sentinels, and it will be interesting to know how you fare on this national duty,&rdquo; he added.
