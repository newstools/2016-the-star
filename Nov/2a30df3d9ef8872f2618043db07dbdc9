Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi (pictured) has asked the Law Society of Kenya to join the opposition in removing President Uhuru Kenyatta s Jubilee administration from power. He spoke during an LSK dinner in Nakuru.Mudavadi told the lawyers to stop sitting on the fence and instead join Kenyans in agitating for meaningful change. If you live in Kenya, you cannot plead ignorance of what is the greatest rip-off of people by this administration, he said.Mudavadi said the ballooning public debt, rising youth unemployment and Jubilee s misplaced priorities will lead the country to socioeconomic destruction. At the national level, we are missing it when this administration embarks on a reckless borrowing spree for turnkey projects that have increased government borrowing to unsustainable levels. We each carry a debt of Sh79,000 courtesy of a government of rent seekers, he said.The ANC leader is pushing for the creation of the National Super Alliance an coalition of all opposition parties, among them Raila Odinga s ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka s Wiper and Moses Wetang ula s Ford Kenya to effectively remove Jubilee from power.On Sunday, the Amani leader was among a group of leaders who attended a thanksgiving rally for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, who fell out with Jubilee and formed his Chama Cha Mashinani party. Mudavadi said runaway corruption is intolerable . The law charges LSK with the fate of the Constitution of Kenya. You are the Sentinels, and it will be interesting to know how you fare on this national duty, he added.
