Those involved in the alleged misspending of Sh105 million Kisumu Ward Development Fund should be surcharged, new fund committee chairman Edwin Anayo has said.He was sworn in on Thursday. Anayo said a changing of the guard is necessary to restore public confidence. A lot of expectations await me, but I want to ensure I oversee the executive without influence and restore the committee s image, Anayo said.Anayo was elected after the assembly on Tuesday reconstituted the Ward Development Fund Committee following the alleged misuse of Sh105 million.The committee is comprised of 11 members, down from 17. The members are Aggrey Ogosi (East Seme), Gabriel Ochieng (Kondele), Maurice Aloo (Ahero), Jane Omollo (nominated), Samuel Ong ow (Masogo Nyang oma), Maina Koko (North Nyakach), Nereah Okombo (Manyatta B), Samuel Ombogo (North West Kisumu), Bob Ndolo (nominated), Philip Anayo (Milimani-Market) and Caroline Owen (Kisumu North). The report containing the list of new members was tabled by majority leader Marlin Olero on Tuesday and adopted. Speaker Ann Adul directed the reconstitution on October 25 after MCAs raised the flag about the bloated panel.The fund is still under investigation by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.Last month, four of the five signatories to the ward fund account from the executive were quizzed for hours by graft investigators. Ten MCAs and a senior county assembly officer were also questioned.The investigations were preceded by a unanimous voting by the members to invite the EACC and the Auditor General to conduct a forensic audit of the books.
