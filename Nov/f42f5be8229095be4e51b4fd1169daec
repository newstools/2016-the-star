Cord leader Raila Odinga is politicising the Itare water project in the Rift Valley to hoodwink the Kalenjin into voting for him, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said. Raila is out to paint the Jubilee administration in bad light to win the community s votes just because he believes DP William Ruto deserted him at the time of need in 2007, Muturi said. Raila is desperate and busy looking for loopholes to win the vote-rich Rift Valley ahead of 2017 by maligning Jubilee s governance at all costs. Otherwise, why would one want to stop a project meant to benefit thousands of residents? he asked.The Speaker said intimidation will not stop Jubilee from implementing projects. He spoke at the weekend at Sotik Stadium during a fundraiser. Muturi also drummed up support for the Jubilee Party, President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto and for Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, who wants to run for Bomet governor.
