GSU and AP officers yesterday were warned against beating, torturing, raping and terrorising innocent Mumias citizens in their efforts to recover stolen guns.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights condemned widespread reports of police brutality.

Thugs broke in on Tuesday night.Police ransacked homes and businesses and residents said cops beat and tortured them, damaging property, setting fires and causing burn injuries. Rapes were reported.KNHCR vice chairman George Morara urged police to work with residents in intelligence-led operations, not collective punishment.Commissioner Shatikha Chivusia said use of force to recover weapons may be unsuccessful, as in Kapedo in October 2014, unless the public is involved. Police should be preemptive, not reactive. Innocent mothers and children are victims of the operation. The operation is more of a revenge mission on the wrong target to recover the weapons, Chivusia said. Moraga said, The raid on Booker post points to gaps in the security system. It s a reminder national and county governments should work together and swiftly set up County Policing Authorities. The raid by security agencies in Mumias town has violated constitutional human rights provisions, Morara said. He asked the police IG to order the release of impounded motorcycles and ensure residents continue with their normal lives.
