The party has written to acting Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung u to expunge their names from its members register.On Tuesday Achani said she is ready to take over. Those who think there will be a by-election should read what the law says. If [the governor] vacates office, I will definitely take over [for the remainder of the term], she said.Achani said she is an ODM member and so there should be no cause for alarm in case Mvurya is kicked out of office. She made the remarks while flagging off Sh13 million medical equipment donated by the Kenya Red Cross Society to 86 facilities.Mvurya refused to comment on his expulsion. I can only speak about what has brought us here. If you have something else, I m sorry I can t comment, he said.Achani said she still supports Mvurya, who defected to the Jubilee Party last month, although she remains in ODM. She urged residents to elect leaders who have their interest at heart.If the expulsion is effected, the IEBC would be expected to organise by-elections in the areas represented by the expelled MCAs and MPs members of the National Assembly, senators and woman representatives. Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga was among those expelled from ODM. While distributing food in Lunga Lunga, she said she remains woman rep as she was elected by residents. I have been working according to the ODM manifesto, which mainly focuses on serving the people. I exercise my democratic right to freedom of expression and association, she said. Chidzuga said ODM has not served her with a letter of expulsion. She dismissed the decision, saying she will not work with dictators, who do not want to be criticised. In the case of governor, the Constitution provides that the deputy governor assumes office as governor for the remainder of the term.
