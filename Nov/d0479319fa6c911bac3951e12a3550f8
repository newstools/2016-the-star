A Kisii-based salesman, who works for a local micro finance institution has been named the winner of an Isuzu double-cab valued at KSh4.5 million. He was awarded the grand prize as a part of the recently-concluded Betway customer reward promotion dubbed 30,000 Prizes in 30 Days. Geoffrey Koech, the 32-year old salesman, was beaming with joy when the brand new double-cab was handed over to him yesterday in Nairobi by Betway Kenya country manager, Wanja Gikonyo. During the session, an evidently elated Koech made public his plans to venture into maize farming in the near future, especially now that he has a sturdy truck to transport farm inputs and harvested produce to the market. This win has come at the right time; the truck will come in handy especially now that I am seriously considering venturing into agriculture on a full-time basis, he said.Koech is also interested in the building and construction industry, a dream well-substantiated considering his seemingly unending streak of success. He is clearly a man blessed with luck, having won a television and smart phone earlier this year in a similar Betway customer reward promotion. His biggest betting win before this was Sh305,000, which he won after placing a multiple bet last year. The month-long 30,000 Prizes in 30 Days promotion offered sports betting fans the chance to win 30,000 prizes in 30 days.
