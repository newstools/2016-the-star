Presidential hopeful Abduba Dida yesterday said he is best placed to end corruption. The former presidential candidate said Kenya s biggest problem is corruption. Dida spoke on Monday in Mumias town after opening the Alliance for Real Change office at Bulimbo in Matungu, Kakamega county.Dida is a former teacher of English literature and religion. He plans to tour the country to drum up support. The country lacks divine leadership. Those entrusted with leadership do not value humanity and lack capacity to adjust to the thinking envisioned in the Constitution. They don t understand what God wants from them, Dida said.He said money meant to benefit all Kenyans is stolen under the purview of highly connected individuals. It is shameful people still die for lack of medication and equipment in health facilities, Dida said.
