A section of Nairobi taxi operators on Wednesday endorsed ODM leader Raila Odinga's 2017 presidential bid.The group accused the Jubilee administration of failing to protect the sector from external forces that have affected the business.George Kanja, taxi operators union interim chairperson, said the Jubilee government has only protected businesses associated with elites at their expense."Despite having worked closely with Jubilee in the last campaigns, we have seen the police intimidate and extort from us," Kanja said. Kanja added the government s failure to develop a policy for the sector has also led to loss of hundreds of jobs. The group accused the said foreign companies of remitting taxes to their countries of origin."On security matters, anytime we try to seek the intervention of government officials, they dismiss us as useless people," Kanja said.Kanja said that many taxi operators are now finding it hard to operate and pay loans for the cars they acquired."We are all suffering irrespective of the area of operation, company or technology being used and we came to Raila since he is the only one who listens to people," Kanja said.He was accompanied by more than one thousand taxi operators who sought ODM leader's attention on the matters at Orange house.The operators asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop lying to Kikuyus that they have to fight Raila following his "personal differences" with the opposition chief.Read: Angry Uhuru turns Jubilee meet into Raila attack arena "Kikuyus don t have a war with Raila. We actually support his ideals and we are totally behind him in the fight against corruption that is rampant with this Jubilee regime," David Mutero, digital taxi operators secretary general, said. ODM executive director Oduor Ong wen, speaking on behalf of Raila who was away, told the taxi drivers ODM will craft a policy to protect the sector if elected to power."Raila will have a meeting with you in two weeks so that we can exploit available opportunities together," said Ong wen.Mutero said the Jubilee government was pushing them out of business through cartels. He said that interests charged on bank loans are still high while the environment of doing business was not good."We cannot be claiming that the Presidency is ours because we come from Kiambu and yet we are suffering. We no longer fear Raila after we found out the truth," said Mutero.He added that Uber has reduced the prices as well as payments to their drivers who earn was little as Sh 26 per kilometer."We have tried to access government officials but they keep snubbing us," said Mutero.
