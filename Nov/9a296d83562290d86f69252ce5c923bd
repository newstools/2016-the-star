The Nairobi government has said it will stop hawkers from creeping back into the city centre.Governor Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said they are determined to end the menace, irrespective of whether they will be voted in again.The county also targets boda boda operators, street children, premises with loud music, matatus and illegal car wash joints. We are changing this narrative by offering genuine leadership. We do not care that it is an election year. We must defend and restore the dignity of walking, living and doing business in this city. And we will do this at every cost, Mueke said. We are already into this matter. We are done with Eastleigh and we are pushing on with other areas. People in Buruburu can now breathe. A committee chaired by Mueke recently resolved that hawkers be expelled from Eastleigh s central business district after a conflict between them and other businesspeople.
