The Nairobi government has started piping water to Spring Valley-Matopeni ward in Kayole. Area MCA Abdi Guyo told the Star the project was initiated by the now-defunct Nairobi City Council and has been stalled for years because of the previous contractor s improper strategic planning. The tender was cancelled and awarded to another contractor.
