President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again lashed out at opposition leaders for "misleading wananchi with retrogressive politics".He said the country will never move ahead with leaders spreading hatred, lies and propaganda about his administration.Uhuru spoke in Kanduyi, Bungoma town, when he made a stopover on his way to the first graduation ceremony at Kibabii University College.He said the Jubilee administration has been trying to improve the lives of Kenyans since 2013."I'm shocked and surprised to see today in the papers someone saying that [Chief of Staff Joseph] Kinyua went home because we gave Bungoma county Sh100 million meant for the health sector," Uhuru said.''I'm asking, is the money supposed to come to Bungoma hospitals for residents to acquire proper healthcare or is it supposed to go back to Nairobi?''He said there are some elected leaders who "specialise in making noise every time the government does a good thing for the citizens".Uhuru told the opposition leaders to tell Kenyans what they have achieved in the years they have served in the government.He said Bungoma has received a charter for Kibabii University College, which they had been denied for many years.The President also said Pan Paper Mills is being revived and many roads are being constructed in the area. Uhuru said some leaders are constantly nagging the government with politics that might divide the country."Anyone who cannot see anything good for his country is not supposed to be in the country or alive," he said. "I want to ask my fellow opposition leaders to put our differences aside and work together for the sake of our country.'' Uhuru said the Jubilee administration wants a country where people should not worry about someone's tribe, religion or status.He promised to pump Sh300 million to enable Kibabii University complete buildings.Present were Education CS Fred Matiang'i, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, Senator Moses Wetang'ula and several MPs.
