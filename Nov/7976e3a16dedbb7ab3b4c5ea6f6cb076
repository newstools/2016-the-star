It is imperative that we devise tactics to vanquish al Shabaab in Kenya and Boko Haram in Nigeria,&rdquo; he said when he met Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria yesterday.Buhari promised to support Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed in her quest for the position of African Union Commission chairperson.The DP said AU should embrace intra-African trade and investment, which he termed as a precursor to prosperity.&ldquo;As a continent, we should encourage trade and commerce among ourselves before venturing into outside markets. That way, we will buy Africa and build Africa,&rdquo; Ruto said.The latest endorsement comes in the wake of a similar seal of approval from Ivory Coast, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Algeria.In Algeria, Senate President Ben Saleh Abdalkader told Ruto his country will back Mohamed.&ldquo;We know Aminas&rsquo; potential based on her experience and we assure you we will give her full support,&rdquo; Saleh said when he met the Deputy President in Algiers.
