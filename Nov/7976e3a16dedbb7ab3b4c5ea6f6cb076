Deputy President William Ruto has said terrorism remains a big threat to international peace and security. Ruto said extremists take advantage of vulnerable youth to recruit them to al Shabaab, Boko Haram, ISIS and al Qaeda. We must remain vigilant and face terrorists. It is imperative that we devise tactics to vanquish al Shabaab in Kenya and Boko Haram in Nigeria, he said when he met Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria yesterday.Buhari promised to support Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed in her quest for the position of African Union Commission chairperson.The DP said AU should embrace intra-African trade and investment, which he termed as a precursor to prosperity. As a continent, we should encourage trade and commerce among ourselves before venturing into outside markets. That way, we will buy Africa and build Africa, Ruto said.The latest endorsement comes in the wake of a similar seal of approval from Ivory Coast, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Algeria.In Algeria, Senate President Ben Saleh Abdalkader told Ruto his country will back Mohamed. We know Aminas potential based on her experience and we assure you we will give her full support, Saleh said when he met the Deputy President in Algiers. On his part, Sierra Leone President Ernest Koroma pledged his country s support. We know we have a candidate from an Ecowas member state but we know Amina has what it takes to steer the commission and the Africa agenda within the AU, said President Koroma during a meeting with Ruto in Free Town. Ruto is touring west and northern African states to campaign for Amina.
