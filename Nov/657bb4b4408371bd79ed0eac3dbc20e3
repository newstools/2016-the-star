Nyandarua needs a serious leader who understands and wants to solve the problems in the county, former KU lecturer Wilfred Murioga has said.The ideal leader, he said, should not only address the county s problems, but should also have the capacity to unite residents regardless of which region of the county they belong to or their origins. I am that leader. We should have the best candidate to manage and run Nyandarua, Murioga said.He spoke at Happy Valley Centre, Kipipiri, where he announced he will run for Nyandarua governor.Murioga contested in 2013, but lost. Many people have asked me, and I have said yes. I have the relevant experience and academic qualifications, he said.
