An incitement case against URP MPs Alfred Keter and Sonia Birdi is set to be concluded before the 2017 general elections.Naivasha chief magistrate Peter Gesora said it would be difficult dealing with the case in the election period since the MPs and key witnesses are "deeply involved in politics".Gesora directed the prosecution to take two days so that all State witnesses could testify.Assistant DPP Njagi Nderitu is set to question five more witnesses when the matter is heard next on March 30 and 31, 2017.Keter and Birdi are jointly charged with incitement to disobedience of the law, and intimidating public officers.They also face different counts, including creating disturbance at the Gilgil weighbridge on January 24, 2015.The charge sheet states that the MPs used 'unprintable words' while demanding the release of a trailer that had been impounded for exceeding the set axle-load limit and lacking correct paperwork.A video of the MPs harassing staff at the weighbridge went viral.Read: Keter, Birdi lose bid to stop prosecutionAlso read: State House Comptroller ordered to testfy in MPs Keter, Birdi case
