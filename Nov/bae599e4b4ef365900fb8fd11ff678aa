The Nation has been closely following allegations of massive corruption at the counties. Our worst fears that bad manners might be devolved in the new dispensation now appear prophetic.These allegations are serious, and they will be processed and dealt with as we have on all other matters of corruptionWe will continue demonstrating our commitment to maintaining high standards of governance at all levels of government.Interestingly, Raila Odinga has come out wearing a new hat: that of the chief advocate, spokesman and defender of besieged governors in ODM- controlled counties.He wants a different standard to be applied in addressing county theft.As a national leader, it would serve Odinga well to attempt to be seen as consistent and even-handed.Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, he is not addressing the county corruption allegations with the sort of attitude that demonstrates zero-tolerance. Indeed, he is defensive, collusive and suspiciously tolerant.[VIDEO] Raila defends Cord governors, says corruption audit biasedTo Hon. Raila Odinga, the war against corruption is just politics. he wants it prosecuted on a political platform and that explains his latest statements.In the journey of integrity, transparency, accountability and good governance, we can only ever choose one side.There is no option to accept, tolerate or defend some acts of corruption while condemning others.Odinga does not have the luxury of hunting with the hounds and running with the hares.His current confusion and double standards betrays a deep conflict of interests that strongly suggests complicity in graft.We do hope that when the lawfully mandated Anti-corruption agencies come calling, Odinga will be at hand to tell Kenyans what he knows about Wizi Mashinani.Unedited
