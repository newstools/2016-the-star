Fifty hotel operators in Kabarnet town, Baringo county, were arrested in a swoop on Wednesday and charged with selling food in unhygienic conditions.They were fined Sh1,500 to Sh50,000. They were charged with displaying and selling food and substances without a licence and handling food without protective clothing and staff medical certificates.John Rono, proprietor of Sinkoro Hotel, said the allegations were unfair and discriminatory as some people were fined more than others. He was fined Sh50,000 for operating in a dirty kitchen and not having a medical certificate.In May last year, the public health department had sued the county government for failing to improve hygiene in the town, build a drainage system and put up a dump site.In August last year, 14 hoteliers were also charged and fined in the same court.
