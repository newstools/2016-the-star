The National Assembly is this morning expected to approve Lt Col (Rtd) Julius Githiria as Nacada chairman, taking over from former Naivasha MP John Mututho. Githiria is currently the director of the Institute of Professional Security Studies. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated him on October 18. The National Assembly Security and National Administration Committee, which was vetting the nomination, will table its report for approval. Githiria will succeed Mututho, who was appointed the chairman of the Transport Licensing Appeals Tribunal. Mututho sued Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery for sacking him, saying this was because of his fight against corruption at the authority. &ldquo;My retirement is in bad faith since I have been at the forefront of fighting corruption at the agency, where Sh500 million has been lost,&rdquo; he said. The High Court temporarily stopped Nkaissery from retiring Mututho, saying he had an arguable case.
