Technical University of Kenya are sparing no effort as they seek to become the first team to win the SportPesa Super 8 Champions League when they face Jericho All Stars in the final at Nyayo stadium next weekend.Tuk needed the lottery of penalties to edge Melta Kabiria in the semi-final and will hope to atone for missing out on defending the SportPesa Super 8 Premier League crown. It will be a very delicate match for us. The players have been on a short school holiday before the Champions League and they are trying to get their minds in correct frame for the competition but they are willing to go an extra mile to see that we win it. They (Jericho) are not just any other team, they are good and we are taking this match with the seriousness it deserves, said Tuk coach Luke Oluoch. We played well against Melta and the fact that we beat them, has really given the team the morale and motivation to even do better. We learnt from our mistakes and we will be aiming for victory. We know it will not be easy because they want us to win as much as we do but we are preparing well because our goal is to make it to the final and possibly win the tournament, added Oluoch.The university lads who train at the Railways Training Institute in South B will once again look up to inspirational forward Jeconiah Uyoga, who missed out on the golden boot award as well as Stephen Odhiambo. Tuk, formerly known as Kenya Polytechnic, represents Starehe Constituency and will be keen to make their fellow college lads proud come November 13.
