The Kisumu government unlawfully paid the CoG an extra Sh3.2 million and millions more to suppliers and contractors for incomplete projects, the Auditor General has shown.The Council of Governors had asked for Sh7.9 million for 2014-15. The CoG has a fund into which all the counties contribute a specified amount. The money is meant for intergovernmental relations and other expenses.The Kisumu government paid Sh11.1 million instead of the Sh7.9 million demanded in a statement dated October 9, 2014. The audit report shows the county paid the money from its recurrent vote to the CoG between January and June 2015.Auditor General Edward Ouko has queried the overpayment. Ouko said the contributions totalling Sh11.1 million were unlawful.The county further paid Panesars Kenya Ltd Sh3.7 million for furniture procured by the CoG office through LPO No 568 dated September 23, 2014. The audit report indicates that the furniture was received by the council s procurement department on September 25, 2014. Ouko said it remains unclear why the supplier was paid by the Kisumu government. Ouko took the county to task over the incomplete Forems-Lolwe road. A physical verification of the project on August 25, 2015, showed that the supply and installation of concrete, pipes, culverts and installations worth Sh718,500 was incomplete.The AG said the county government may not have received value for money for the road, which was worth Sh2.9million. The county is also on the spot for a stalled ward project at Lumumba Health Centre, where a contractor vanished after he was paid Sh6.7 million. Ouko said no opening tender minutes and technical evaluation reports were provided for audit.
