Two parliamentary committees are sitting on a petition to probe cases of mob justice and extrajudicial killings, a concerned citizen has said. They are the Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Foreign Relations and the National Assembly Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunity.David Gesicho says they have not processed the petition five months since it was filed. Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro committed the petition to the committee on June 7 while National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi forwarded it on June 28.Gesicho, in a letter to the two speakers dated November 14, requested them to reconsider committing the petition to the committees. He urged the two speakers to set up a joint select committee, with an extended mandate to prove rising incidences of police brutality and mob justice.Gesicho said while the committees continue to delay the petition instances of police and mob violence continue to be reported in the media . He said, The latest incidents of police violence involve an incident where Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto was injured by a tear gas canister lobbed by police. This took place on November 6 at Silibwet Stadium. Police have, however, denied that the governor was hit by a tear gas canister. Rutto was flown to South Africa for nose surgery. He jetted back on Friday.Gesicho also refered to the November 3 incident where journalists covering anti-graft demonstrations in Uhuru Park were assaulted by police officers.Gesicho wants the committees to update him on the progress of the matter after he failed to avail additional information sought by the Senate committee in a letter on July 26. The committee had asked him to provide accurate statistics on police brutality and mob justice from relevant authorities by August 9. The petitioner tried to get more information and data but was handicapped by lack of resources and mandate to request for such information from relevant authorities and organisations, Gesicho writes.The Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Foreign Relations is chaired by Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji while the National Assembly Committee on Cohesion and Equal Opportunity is chaired by nominated MP Johnson Sakaja. The petitioner is humbly requesting that the Senate and the National Assembly reconsiders establishing a Joint Parliamentary Committee to inquire into and investigate the disturbing trend of occurrences of police and mob violence in the Republic of Kenya, Gesicho wrote in his letter.Standing Orders require parliamentary committees to investigate any matter and report back to the House within in months.Records in the National Assembly show that the 11th Parliament was sitting on 120 public appeals from citizens, with Kenyans seeking justice from Parliament left wondering what happened to their petitions, which have not been acted upon for years.In what could raise questions on the weight MPs place on public petitions, the teams are yet to conclude almost half of such requests, some dating as far back as 2013 and 2014.This is in express violation of House Standing Orders which state that public petitions must be concluded within 60 days and reports expeditiously tabled before the National Assembly.In February this year, the Independent Medico Legal Unit said that about 126 people were killed by police in 2015 alone.Imlu s executive director Peter Kiama said 97 out of the 126 were summarily executed.He also said that 20 people were shot dead as officers tried to protect their lives while nine others were shot under unclear circumstances.Kiama also said that Nairobi is tops with 61 executions, followed by Nakuru with seven.Isiolo recorded six, Kirinyaga (5); Turkana, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Homa Bay had four each while Narok and Nyeri had three.The highest number of killings were recorded in January 23.
