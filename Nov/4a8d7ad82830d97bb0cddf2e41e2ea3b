Reigning national women s league champions Nairobi Water jetted back into the country yesterday morning from the 34th edition of the Africa Championships in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso where they finished fifth overall.This was the highest performance ever and an improvement in the annual competition. They finished two places higher than their previous outing. The team fell to Cameroon s FAP Yaound in their quarter-final and had to compete in the 5-8th classification matches where they edged out Mikish from Democratic Republic of Congo 29-28. Head coach Jack Ochieng said: That was good performance for the club and country bearing in mind that most teams were strong and experienced than us. We only get a shot at these championships once each year, and this year things worked out for us. The tactician now aims at retaining the local league title for the fourth time running as retaining the East and Central Africa Federation Senior Club Championship title at the Nyayo Stadium this month. The regional show has attracted teams from Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, DR Congo, and Kenya.
