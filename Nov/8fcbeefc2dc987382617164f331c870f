Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama was conspicuously absent at a media briefing led by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Tuesday.Muthama attended Cord press conference at Capitol Hill, days after Kalonzo publicly gave him a dressing down, accusing him of causing political division in the region.Muthama who is part of Cord Management Committee was accompanied by co chairmen Siaya Senator James Orengo and Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu.Kalonzo rebuked Muthama after he warned Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana of a fierce political battle if he did not fold up his Muungano Party to Join Wiper.The remarks did not go down well with the Wiper leader who immediately took Muthama head-on, accusing him of using wrong language to woo the party s support.More on this: Why Kalonzo gave Muthama a dress downBut Wiper leaders said there was no fallout between Muthama and Kalonzo, and that problems concerning them were manufactured by unknown forces."He is addressing another presser... We realised the movement at the Wiper and Cord levels must move froward," said Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar."Stick to what Muthama already said; somebody somewhere is manufacturing stories. We are not aware of the fall-out."Omar accused the media of escalating the matter saying: "We will not allow you to put words into our mouths. There is no fall-out."Amid rumours about the Ukambani affairs, reports indicate Muthama will defend his seat on an ODM ticket.He has been accused by a majority of 2013 Wiper defectors of being the reason behind the loss of some assured parliamentary and ward seats in the region.Kalonzo is said to be bitter with the Senator for doing very little to push for his candidature for the presidency under the Cord coalition.This is said to be despite Muthama's appointment as co-chairman of the coalition's executive management committee, alongside Orengo.
