Fresh from winning the Masters Junior title at the Africa Nations Cup on Sunday, Sneha Kotecha is now plotting to win the ITF/CAT junior tournament slated for next week at the Nairobi Club.Kotecha was in fine form as she trounced South Africa s Delien Kleinhans 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 in a tough three set final. Kotecha said the win has inspired her to seek more titles. I m happy to have won the title. It was grueling week and sometimes I had to fight from a set down to win some matches but I believe I have the momentum to go all the way and win the crown, she said.Kotecha had upset top seed and highly fancied Aisha Niyonkuru of Burundi in the semi-finals. I was encouraged by the win over Niyonkuru considering she is tough competitor. I am now more inspired to go for the next ITF event and I hope I can go all the way, added Kotecha.Ryan Randiek, who reached the quarter-finals of the under-14 category during the Africa Nations Championship, is also optimistic of improved results in the continental showpiece. This was good tournament in terms of preparations and playing with the best players on the continent has sharpened my game. I look forward to the next event and I hope I can go further than I did, he added.Kenya will be represented by eight players, who will have to come through a qualifying round in order to get to the main draw. They include Samuel Urasa, David Ominde, Suhail Hooker, Alex Osodo and Moses Mwaura (boys) and Natalie Otieno, Faith Nyabera and Esther Wahome (girls).
