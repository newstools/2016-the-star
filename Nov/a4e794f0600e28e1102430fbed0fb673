An al Shabaab returnee who surrendered to the government two years ago was found dead on Tuesday morning.The body of Abdulkarim Mzee had multiple knife wounds and was dumped along the Mombasa-Malindi highway.Witnesses allege he was suffocated with a plastic bag by unknown people a few days ago before being dumped along the highway.Mzee was among seven suspected al Shabaab returnees sought by authorities for engaging in terrorism activities before they surrendered after the State issued an amnesty.The returnees were interrogated by officers from different security agencies, including ATPU and the National Intelligence Service.He surrendered together with Swaleh Ramadhan, Kayuni Khamisi and Farah Abdi after DCI Ndegwa Muhoro released their names and photos.Tension in Majengo remains high as residents fear retaliation from Mzee's associates.Malindi police boss Matawa Mchangi said they will issue a statement over the killing after conducting preliminary investigations.Security and counter-terror agents have been on the spot for carrying out extrajudicial killings of terror suspects.Muslims for Human Rights has called for independent investigations into Mzee's murder."We will hold the government accountable for failure to protect Abdul who had voluntarily surrendered to the authority. The regional coordinator Nelson Marwa should bring to book those responsible," field officer Fahad Changi said.Changi had accompanied Mzee to Marwa's office when he surrendered on November 19, 2014.Mzee has been on the same wanted list as slain terror suspect Ismael Shosi.Shosi had a Sh2 million bounty on his head.He was killed by anti-terror police officers in September during a gunfight at Kishada area, Kisauni.Shosi was linked with a militant group operating from Boni Forest in Lamu county.Read: Ismael Shosi was no terrorist, family says at burialRecently, police issued a terror alert after a leaked intelligence report showed al Shabaab militants could be planning an attack in the Coastal region.The report warned of possible attacks in Kilifi, Tana River and Kitui, but did not give details.It said four terror suspects arrived in Malindi on November 7 and were using a Toyota Prado to coordinate the attacks.They are Shamid Ahmed, leader Abdula Alhdi and Aisha Alhadi, and two identified only as Mohammed and Rashid.It is not clear if Mzee was among the five who were planning the attack.More on this: Al Shabaab terror alert issued in Coast after leaked intelligence reportThe National Counter-Terrorism Centre says terrorist incidents have gone down even further this year, with most of them taking place in towns bordering Somalia.The government has extended the amnesty period indefinitely for Kenyan youth who joined al Shabaab to surrender.
