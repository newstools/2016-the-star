Kaya elders from the Malindi Cultural District Association concluded their seventh annual peace walk yesterday after covering 350km in Kilifi county.They described this year s walk as the most hectic, with lots of challenges due to famine and drought . The elders looked tired after trekking in the scorching sun. Secretary general Joseph Karisa Mwarandu said their peace messages were well received by residents.They expressed concern at the rate at which elderly men are butchered. Mwarandu said they got reports that some youths eat the flesh of their murder victims. Even though this report has not been confirmed, cases of people being killed have been rampant, he said.The elders left Malindi on October 21 to preach peace and walked through three constituencies. They passed through Jilore, Adimaye in Chakama, Shakahola, and Bofu in Malindi constituency, before proceeding to Mrima wa Ndege, Ganze, and Mtondia in Kilifi North.Mrima wa Ndege has a shelter for elderly men accused of practising witchcraft. We found out that youths also kill suspects stealing motorbikes, burn them, then drink palm wine, Mwarandu said.
