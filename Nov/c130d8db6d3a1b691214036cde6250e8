My rivals use the fact that I m married to an MP to discredit my bid because they are scared, Migori governor aspirant Anne Anyanga has said. She is married to Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga.In 2013 Anyanga was chosen to fly ODM s flag in the Migori governor race, but was prevailed upon by the party leadership to deputise Prof Edward Oyugi. They lost to Okoth Obado and Hamilton Orata of PDP. Anne and Edick plan to run again next year.She said her rivals have used this to constantly attack her after finding no problem with my academic credentials, party loyalty and grassroots support. Anyanga accused her rivals of using chauvinist and old propaganda by always bringing up her marriage.She said it was by God s grace that she married into a leader s home and learnt about leadership, just like Moses and Joseph in the Bible, who lived in the homes of leaders before they themselves led the Israelites.Anyanga spoke on Wednesday during the Budho Mokwe show on Mayienga FM. Residents should assess me on my campaign pledges and leadership record. Women vying in forthcoming elections need to be given an equal chance instead of dwelling on minor issues like marriages, she said.
