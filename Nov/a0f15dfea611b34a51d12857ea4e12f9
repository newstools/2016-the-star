The 99 container clinics sold to the government at Sh10 million each had items including portable toilets and office materials.The containers seen by the Star also had consignments of executive chairs, patient chairs and clinical devices.Other items found in them were hospital beds, weighing machines, table units, computers, air conditioners, sinks, syringes and items for visitor waiting bays.The 40-foot furnished containers are said to have been sourced from China at a cost of Sh1 billion, a figure that has been disputed by many factions.They have been under storage at the National Youth Service yard in Miritini, Mombasa, since their importation in two batches in December 2015 and June.Read: Afya House scam calls for full disclosureAlso read: Uhuru sister, cousin were paid Sh200m Health cashTaita Taveta MP Naomi Shaban said they should be taken to designated areas.This will result in assistance for the many suffering Kenyans, she said, and asked leaders to stop politicising the matter."There is need for mobile clinics to be out of Mirirtini. Kenyans are really suffering. We were in Malindi... Our people are in danger," she said."Health is important for everyone. That is why First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has been at the forefront on this."Auditor general Edward Ouko raised questions on whether Estama Limited was qualified to win government tenders for the supply of the containers.Ouko said the company did not supply Kenya Revenue Authority Personal Identification Numbers and Value Added Tax receipts suggesting it did not pay taxes.The Senate Health Committee was sharply divided on the value of container clinics that are the subject of the probe into the Sh3.2 billion Afya House scandal.Chairperson Rachel Nyamai (MP Kitui South) said there was no problem with the consignment, to the fury of other members who walked away during the committee's media briefing.Most of the members questioned how the Sh10 million value for each container was reached, and why the supplier was paid Sh800 million before delivery.The government has been trying to clarify that money was not lost but some MPs still argue that a clinic should cost Kenyans Sh3 million at most.Read: Internal audit on Afya House 'a gross exaggeration of figures', CS Mailu saysThe scandal at the ministry of health was first reported by the Business Daily newspaper two weeks ago.
