The 99 furnished container clinics sold to the government at Sh10 million each had items that may not add up to the bill.The 40-foot containers seen by the Star had consignments of executive chairs, patient chair, portable toilet and clinical devices.Other items found in the container is a hospital bed, weighing machine, table unit, a computer, air conditioner, sink, syringes and well-designed visitor waiting bay.But even this assortment of items could not have resulted in the cost of Sh1 billion to the government.Kenya Revenue Authority documents, referred to in an NTV report, show each container together with contents and cost of shipment, reached a value of Sh1,461,388, yet Sh10 million was spent acquiring each.The cost could have been about Sh146 million as opposed to the Sh1 billion charged.Estama Limited exclusively won the deal to supply the containers.The containers, sourced from China, are said to be vital, and include kits for improving child and maternal care. Speaking to the Star on phone on Wednesday, Duncan Mutua, head of Sales Container Kenya, said the average cost of one-bedroom containers is Sh800,000 while that of those with three bedrooms is Sh1.8 million.In some retail shops, a 20-foot standard container costs Sh210,000, a 40-foot high-cube container goes for Sh350,000 while a reefer (refrigerated) container costs Sh 1 million.Read: Afya House scam calls for full disclosureAlso read: Uhuru sister, cousin were paid Sh200m Health cashThe containers have been in storage for more than a year, at the National Youth Service yard in Miritini, Mombasa, since their importation in two batches in December 2015 and June.Amid the investigations, Taita Taveta MP Naomi Shaban said the contianers should be taken to designated areas.This will result in assistance for the many suffering Kenyans, she said, and asked leaders to stop politicising the matter."There is need for mobile clinics to be out of Mirirtini. Kenyans are really suffering. We were in Malindi... Our people are in danger," she said."Health is important for everyone. That is why First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has been at the forefront on this."Police, the EACC and Parliament are looking into allegations that the cost of the containers was inflated but Health ministry officials, including Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu have defended the transaction.Auditor general Edward Ouko raised questions on whether Estama was qualified to win government tenders for the supply of the containers.Ouko said the company did not supply KRA with Personal Identification Numbers and Value Added Tax receipts, suggesting it did not pay taxes.The Senate Health Committee was sharply divided on the value of container clinics that are the subject of the probe into the Sh3.2 billion Afya House scandal.Chairperson Rachel Nyamai (MP Kitui South) said there was no problem with the consignment, to the fury of other members who walked away during the committee's media briefing.Most of the members questioned how the Sh10 million value for each container was reached, and why the supplier was paid Sh800 million before delivery.The government has been trying to clarify that money was not lost but some MPs still argue that a clinic should cost Kenyans Sh3 million at most.The scandal at the ministry of health was first reported by the Business Daily newspaper two weeks ago.Read: Internal audit on Afya House 'a gross exaggeration of figures', CS Mailu says
