Last year s East and Central Africa Handball Federation tournament, men s runners up Black Mamba are hoping to go a step higher when the event kicks off this Sunday at the Nyayo Stadium. Black Mamba finished second in a three team tournament behind champions and hosts Police of Rwanda while Patriotic Army of Rwanda finished last.Black Mamba coach Martin Abunde said this year s event will be competitive since many teams have confirmed participation, a development he says will push them to go the extramile and perform even better. Truth be told, few teams graced the last edition and therefore it didn t come with stiff competition that we would have wanted . But I am glad this edition has attracted many teams and will no doubt be competitive, he said.He, however, admitted that they have not had the best of training sessions both for the ongoing Kenya Handball Federation national league and the forthcoming event as sometimes they are forced to share the Kaloleni ground with various football teams. But all in all, the morale is high in the playing unit and our objective is to improve on our last year s performance, said Abunde.Black Mamba, who are placed fourth in KHF national league standing with 22 points will come up against Rwanda teams (Police and APR), Zanzibar s Nyuki, Tanzania s and Jeshi la Kujenga Taifa among the international teams.
