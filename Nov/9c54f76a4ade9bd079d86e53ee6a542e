Eight terror suspects have been arrested in Mandera over two al Shabaab attacks that claimed 18 lives, county commissioner Fredrick Shisia said yesterday. Five were arrested after six people were killed at a residential building on October 6, while three others were held after 12 people were slain at Bishaaro Lodge on October 25. Our intelligence forces have established that the suspects have been aiding attackers, while others are among the hit squad. We will bring all of them to justice, Shisia said. He addressed the press yesterday. Shisia said security agents are making progress in rounding up the suspects.On Thursday last week, Mandera anti-terror police received a court order to detain a man suspected of aiding the Tuesday morning terror attack at Bishaaro. The officers told the court they believe Abdirahman, 21, gave the attackers information about the number of hotel occupants and security arrangements of the police and KDF.The court heard that Abdirahman, the hotel s caretaker, did not sleep at the premises on the night of the attack. Prosecution said this is a pointer that he was aware that the attackers would strike but did not warn security agents.Prosecution counsel Alene Mulama told the court the investigations are wide in scope and involve a team from the National Intelligence Service and the Criminal Investigations Department.
