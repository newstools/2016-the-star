The Qatar government has issued stiffer penalties for Miraa traders who fail to follow due process, which may include a death sentence.Director general of Narcotics Control in Qatar Colonel Abdu Rahim Qassim Al Farsi said miraa smugglers may face life sentences or death penalty if they are caught by the Royal Oman police. In 2014 June, miraa exports into the United Kingdom were banned by the then Interior Secretary and the current Prime Minister Teresa May. It is reported the stimulant is still smuggled into the country.In October last year, Nassin Badhi was sentenced to 18 months in prison after she pleaded guilty to smuggling 81kgs of miraa worth Sh3.12 million through Heathrow Airport from Johannesburg.Khat use in the Arab Gulf states, other than Yemen, is illegal and a senior official of the ROP said there has been an increase in miraa smuggling in Qatar which led to the latest warning. According to ROP, 27 cases were reported in which 58 people were involved and 10,240 bundles of khat seized between January and October.During the same period 18 smuggling attempts were foiled and 2,560 kilograms seized.The numbers are up as compared to last year&rsquo;s prompting the renewed warning and the death penalty.Under the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances law by the Royal Oman Police, miraa smugglers and traders could suffer severe punishments which could go as far as being sentenced to life in prison or execution. Anybody found consuming miraa will be fined.Al Farsi said chewing khat is a health hazard and it is no less dangerous than any other drug which affects mental and physical health.
