Western Stima coach Henry Omino says he will welcome the idea of working with winger Baron Oketch again.Oketch left Stima for the 15-time champions Gor Mahia but has found the going tough, as he has been limited to substitute cameos. Omino said he felt he was not ready for the move and had advised him against joining the Ze Maria coached side. Oketch is a good player, and a talented one. I will always work with him when another chance comes by. I had warned him against joining Gor Mahia because I wanted him for at least one more year but he chose to go there, Omino said.The veteran tactician added, He has learnt, and my sources have revealed to me that he wants to re-join us. I have no problem at all, he is our player, and like a prodigal son, we will welcome him. But that depends with his current employers, if they release him, good, if they do not, there are many ways to work it out. Western Stima will complete the season with a home match against Kakamega Homeboyz.
