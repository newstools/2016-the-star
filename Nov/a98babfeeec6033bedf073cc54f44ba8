This is because once we find grabbed land the grabbers quickly move to court and block any demolitio," he said."We all know one cannot do anything about a court order. The courts need to stop giving orders because this slows down any good intent."He added that most politicians are involved in land matters and that they sometimes influence the decisions in their favour.Read: Funding slowed land reforms in past 4 yearsLands CS Jacob Kaimenyi called on Kenyans not to rush to courts over land disputes but explore traditional means of solving cases."Courts will always take longer to conclude a land case; that is why we have thousands of cases in courts across the country.
