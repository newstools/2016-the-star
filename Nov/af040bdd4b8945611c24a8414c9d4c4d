Representatives drawn from over 60 Gor Mahia branches will today hold a demonstration in the Nairobi Central Business District to press the club officials to heed to their demands for involvement in the election process that begins with registration of voters. Led by the chairman of the Council of Branch chairmen Carolus Onyango, the fans’ representatives, said they had on several occasions sought audience with the incumbent office but their grievances have gone unheard. “We have exhausted the avenues for dialogue and so today we will be holding a peaceful demonstration from the Tom Mboya statue and we will head to petition the Gor chairman (Ambrose Rachier) and our club patron (former premier Raila Odinga) to tell us the way forward in regard to the involvement of our branches in organising the upcoming election,” said Onyango. The branches, just like a section of the aspirants earlier this month, took particular issues with the online registration which they said was prone to be misused and could lock out members, who are not tech savvy. “Gor Mahia is a club that has members up to the villages and it is upon the branches who know their genuine members to be involved in the registration so that the elections can be free and fair. We don’t support any particular candidate but we want the next leadership to have the legitimacy to govern the club on behalf of the members,” remarked Peter Ouma, the organising secretary of the council of Gor branches. Aspiring chairman Dan Oketch, who led similar calls with other candidates last week, supported the calls for demonstration, pointing out that the issues raised including reducing the registration fees to Sh100 as per the constitution were pertinent and could not be wished away. “In as much as some of the current officials are chest thumping, the stakeholders are now very clear in demanding for what they deem is their right as regard the club. As an aspiring chairman, I will support the issue and join them in the demonstration if it will force the office to involve all of us in the election process,” said Okech. Gor are set to hold elections next month.
