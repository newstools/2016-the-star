Fishermen in Lake Naivasha want recently introduced Chinese crayfish traps banned.The move comes a few days after the lake s four beach management units kicked out a Chinese investor involved in harvesting crayfish.The fishermen said the traps are easily available in the market but they pick everything in the lake.Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo said the traps net fingerlings and other fish.He said when introduced, the traps were meant for crayfish, but this was no longer the case. We have seen an increase in the use of the crayfish traps from China and they are wiping out all species, Kilo said.He warned that if it s not stopped, the fishing method could wipe out all the gains made in 12 years by fishermen and the government. Kilo said members of the BMU agreed that they would not allow the Chinese back on the lake for unfair practice.
