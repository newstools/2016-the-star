The conjoined twins who were separated by a team of KNH doctors, in a Sh160 million surgery, will be discharged from ICU&nbsp;in two weeks.Blessing and Favour were separated on Tuesday in a intricate 23-hour surgery, making Kenyan the first sub-Saharan Africa nation to&nbsp;to successfully separate sarcophagus twinsRead: KNH surgeons successfully separate conjoined twinsPaediatric surgery head Fred Kabuni told journalists of the estimated cost of the operation saying the&nbsp; National Hospital Insurance Fund will foot the bill. &nbsp; &ldquo;We had to import three anaesthetic machines. The hospital had two but we bought the extra in case one failed," Kabuni tld the media at the hospital on Friday."We also had to buy tissue expanders from the manufacturer in Minneapolis. These are implants which allow specialists to expand the skin so that when they close it they do not have deficiencies.&rdquo; He added that the children were placed on a special diet and also got&nbsp;medications, dressing and toys.The twins, who were born on September 4, 2014, shared the anal canal. They were conjoined in the lower region of the spine.They also shared the cerebral spinal fluid, pelvic and pelvic organs, and the bowel.&ldquo;After the separation no child got a lesser organ than the other. But we will have to create the anal canal for them because they are now passing stool through the abdomen," said Kabuni.He added that they will undergo four more&nbsp;reconstructive surgeries after their wounds heal. Their skin, genitalia and bowels will be reconstructed in these operations.Joel Lesan, head of&nbsp; specialised surgical services, said a mock surgery was carried out after the team went through 3D images&nbsp;that gave a detailed picture of how the babies were conjoined. &ldquo;During the first year while studying the kids, we did some dry-runs that helped us prepare for the actual day," he said."We even held&nbsp;daily&nbsp;meetings, that would last two or three hours, which were aimed at ensuring everything would go as planned." Blessing and Favour are yet to meet following the surgery performed by&nbsp;nine paediatric surgeons, nine neurosurgeons, 10 plastic surgeons, 11 anesthetics and more than 30 nurses. Their mother Caroline Mokiri thanked the doctors and added: "Those two years were not easy for me but I thank God for everything."
