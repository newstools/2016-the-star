Nairobi businesswoman Esther Passaris will on Thursday next week know whether her &lsquo;Harambee&rsquo; party will be registered.High Court judge Lucy Njuguna issued the date after parties in the case made their final submissions.Initially, the tribunal had dismissed Passaris&rsquo; appeal, in which she sought to compel the Registrar of Political parties to register her party.The tribunal ruled that the registrar was within her right to decline to register Harambee Democratic Party and that the registrar did not violate any rights as claimed.Passaris appealed against that decision. Yesterday, she told Njuguna the registrar has failed to comply with the political parties act by declining to register her party.Through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, Passaris said the registrar failed to state what provisions of the Political Parties Act she is relying on in refusing to register her party.Imanyara said the delay in the registration of her party will prevent her from taking part in the elections and any other political activities. &ldquo;The suggested name is in compliance with Section 8 of the Political Parties Act,&rdquo; Imanyara said.Passaris said the tribunal was unfair in dismissing her petition because she has a right to register her party.The registrar denied being influenced in declining to register Passaris&rsquo;s Harambee party.
