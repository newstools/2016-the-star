Relegated Ushuru coach Ken Kenyatta says he is not to blame for the exit of the tax men from the SportPesa Premier League.Speaking for the first time about the Kenya Revenue Authority s disastrous league campaign this season, Kenyatta was quoted on the KPL official portal as saying it was his players lethargy and not his tactics that caused them to drop out of the top flight league after three years. I have no excuses to make. The truth is that the players under-performed and that is why we got ourselves in this situation. It is such a shame even for the club management because they have provided everything possible so that the players can stay motivated, yet they couldn t stay dedicated enough to avoid relegation. That is very bad. I haven t really sat the players down for a heart-to-heart talk yet and when I do, I will just ask them whether they want to continue playing for this club or not. Those who want to stay can stay but those who don t can leave as soon as now. The ones, who stay must be ready to do the hard work because we must get ourselves back to the top flight. That mission begins immediately, he said.Ushuru dropped to the red zone on the final day of the league, losing 3-1 to Posta Rangers when all they needed to survive was a draw of any kind. Their final day defeat saw Sofapaka leapfrog them to safety in position 14.Although it was dramatic, the manner in which they were tossed out. Ushuru had flirted dangerously with relegation twice in their three years in the Kenyan Premier League.In their debut season in 2014, they failed to win any of their 15 second leg matches and endured a nine-match losing streak, to just end up finishing 12th. This year was the same, as they went on free fall again in the second leg, recording 14 win-less games that set the stage for their fall from top tier football in Kenya.
