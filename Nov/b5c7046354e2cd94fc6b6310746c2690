Elgeyo Marakwet leaders have condemned Thursday s killing of one person and the theft of at least 100 cattle in Marakwet.Led by county assembly speaker Albert Kochei, they said the recent killing has reversed gains in restoring peace in the Kerio Valley after two weeks of calm.The attack came six days after Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki launched construction of roads on the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties to curb banditry attacks.Kochei urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to offer a lasting solution to insecurity after several attempts to end hostilities between the Pokot and the Marakwet communities in the Kerio Valley failed. Dear Mr President, our peaceful Kerio Valley is turning to be a valley of death. Please listen to the painful voices of residents of the Kerio Valley, he said on Friday in Iten.Kochei said the grassroots leaders have done everything in their power to end the skirmishes, but bandits continue to wreak havoc. As a county leadership, we have done all that is expected of us, though knowing quite well that security is a national function, he said.Police officers said the middle-aged man was shot dead by bandits suspected to be from Tiaty, Baringo East.The recent killing brings the death toll in the Kerio Valley attacks to 18 since March this year. Area leaders led by Endo MCA Festus Kirop have urged traders to go to the area and buy farm produce that is rotting on the farms.Kirop said fruits, including mangoes, bananas, oranges and tomatoes, are rotting as traders fear to go to the area due to banditry attacks. West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo on Sunday said lack of education in Baringo East is to blame for the rising cases of banditry attacks as a majority of Pokot youth in Baringo East are idle.
