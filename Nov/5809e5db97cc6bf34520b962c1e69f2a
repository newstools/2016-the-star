Police to detain Olympic official for three daysThe police were yesterday allowed to detain National Olympics Committee-Kenya (Noc-k) second vice-chairman, Bernard Ekumbo for three days to allow them complete investigations. The prosecution wanted to detain Ekumbo for seven days but senior principal magistrate Theresa Nyangena said three days was enough. Ekumbo was also the Deputy Chef-de-Mission for Team Kenya for the Rio 2016 Olympics. Close to Sh80 million is said to have been squandered during the Olympic Games. Ekumbo was not required to plead to any charges.The court heard police are still following crucial leads and will require more time before charges are preferred against the suspect.The prosecutor Eddy Kadebe said Ekumbo, who is also chairperson of Kenya Swimming Federation is being investigated for theft, abuse of office and neglect of official duty.Ekumbo will become the fifth Nock official to be arrested and charged over the Rio 2016 Games scandal. "From the time he was arrested and the time within which to conduct and conclude investigation had not been adequate and requires more time,&rdquo; said Kadebe. The lawyer said it will be just and fair if the court allows Police hold the official for a week to complete investigations. Among the items the prosecution claims Ekumbo was found with includes Olympic sweaters, tracksuits, Tusker Jackets, swimming googles, swimming jackets and other kits some of which were allegedly stolen way back in 2010.Ekumbo however, opposed the DPP&rsquo;S application arguing that his constitutional right to be released on bail will be breached. Ekumbo, through his lawyer told Senior Principal Magistrate Theresa Nyangena that he was willing to abide by any condition set by the court.His lawyer further stated that Ekumbo was leading a delegation to FINA international swimming games since he was the chairperson Kenya Swimming Federation and detaining him will interfere with his official duties.However, Kadebe said another person can lead the Kenya delegation.
