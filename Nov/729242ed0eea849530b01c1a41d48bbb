The Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation and the Coast Interfaith Council of Clerics are complaining for lack of drugs and poor services at the Coast Provincial General Hospital.They have criticised negligence, which they say has reached plumbed new depths.Despite the county pumping billions of shillings into renovation of the facility, the two groups say only one wing of the hospital is in good condition. The rest, they said, is in a &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; state.They said most of patients sleep on the floor for lack of beds.&ldquo;The floors are dirty as they are not regularly cleaned,&rdquo; MYWO chairperson Afia Rahma said.She said accident victims who need emergency treatment can spend up to three hours on arrival before being attended to.&ldquo;The available doctors concentrate on a few. Above that, nurses and doctors in the facility have poor attitude,&rdquo; Rahma said.CICC board member Bishop Dena Jonathan said it is difficult to have a transfusion as the hospital&rsquo;s blood bank is always dry.They spoke on Friday at the Mombasa Beach Hotel when they met with African Peer Review Mechanism officials.Regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said he will visit the facility.&ldquo;If it turns out to be true, I will ask Governor Hassan Joho to sort out the mess,&rdquo; he said.Marwa, however, said the biggest hospital at the Coast has undergone robust improvement, with installation of vital medical equipment.
