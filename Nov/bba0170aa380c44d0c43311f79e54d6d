Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago wants a plan to install a spokesman for the Kikuyu community in Eldoret stopped.This was after the move sparked a row among Kikuyu political leaders wrangling over 2017 politics.Mandago said the leaders should agree before the ceremony takes place, suggesting it be postponed to a date after next year&rsquo;s elections.&ldquo;The security committee should look into the issues raised and then decide to either allow or stop the function. But I think it should be put off,&rdquo; Mandago said.One group led by businessman Joseph Wainaina wants the installation on December 3 cancelled. However, MCAs Peter Chomba (Huruma) and Francis Muya (Langas) are in favour of the event. Deputy President William Ruto has been invited to attend the event at 64 Stadium. Gema national organising secretary Paul Kinyanjui said they are opposed to the installation.&ldquo;We do not see the need for a ceremony especially at this time when the country is headed for elections,&rdquo; Kinyanjui said. Stephen Gathuo, an elder, said the function will send a wrong signal to other communities in the region.
