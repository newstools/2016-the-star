Deputy President William Ruto, campaigning at the Coast, has urged Cord leader Raila Odinga to stop opposing development projects that improve lives. Raila and his family are using tap water, yet he is opposing water projects meant to quench the thirst of Kenyans. You tell us you are seeking leadership, yet you oppose development projects that are set to benefit poor Kenyans. Don t be cheated by this man, Ruto said at Werugha on Friday.Raila has opposed the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang a, the Ndakaini and Itare dam projects. He and others say they will cost catastrophic enviormental damage. The government says there are no major adverse impacts, just benefits. He is opposing all development projects by the government and soon, he will come here to oppose the Mzima 2 water project that will cost the government Sh42 billion. I wonder whether a man with a right mind can oppose projects that will benefit the people, Ruto said.The DP said the government has set aside Sh50 billion for Coast water projects. Ruto said Jubilee is the only government that has set aside so much money to end water shortage.He said no previous government set aside half as much money to deal with water problems. Ruto urged the community to join the government. A person does not vote to be in the opposition, you vote to be in government, he said. Ruto said the Coast will be in government next year. You will not be in the opposition. We shall not leave you out. You have seen the development we have undertaken in this region. We have brought electricity, water, constructed roads and paid examination fees for candidates, he said.The DP urged residents not to follow follow people who have not decided who will be their presidential candidate. All they do best is leading protests, he said.
