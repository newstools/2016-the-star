Kenyan taxpayers have a right to know how much the shuttle diplomacy blitz and charm offensive on behalf of Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed is costing them. Mohamed is Kenya s candidate for the next chairperson of the African Union Commission. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have gone out of their way to campaign for her among fellow AU members.Deputy President Ruto has been flying from capital to capital in West Africa, accompanied by CS Mohamed. Since they are not using Air Force One but commercial airliners they and their considerable retinues must be spending literally hundreds of millions of shillings.Kenyans recall with distaste the Sh100 million used on the so-called Hustler Jet on yet another round of shuttle diplomacy involving DP Ruto, when he was campaigning against the Kenyan cases including his and Uhuru s then at the ICC in The Hague.What is the Amina campaign costing us and what is the return on that investment likely to be?
