Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula should be patient for the opposition ticket as what matters is which candidate is most popular and can beat President Uhuru Kenyatta, a leader has said.ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega governor) said, &ldquo;At the moment, [Cord principal] Raila Odinga is the most popular candidate for the opposition and people like Wetang&rsquo;ula should be patient because a competitor cannot disqualify others.&rdquo; He said the delay in naming the coalition flagbearer is deliberate &ldquo;as opposition was still expanding&rdquo;.Oparanya said Wetang&rsquo;ula should first put his house in order before setting his eyes on the Cord ticket.In an interview with a local daily yesterday, Wetang&rsquo;ula said Raila and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka should disqualify themselves from contesting the presidential ticket as they have run for President before and lost. The Bungoma senator said he is the best suited to deliver victory because he has not been tested before.Raila has expressed confidence that a technical team picked to come up with modalities of picking the opposition&rsquo;s presidential candidate will come up with an agreeable formula. Raila, Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kalonzo are angling for the Cord ticket, with each declaring himself the best bet.Wetang&rsquo;ula is battling rebels within his Ford Kenya party who want to expel him over what they term &ldquo;mismanagement of the party&rdquo;.A faction led by activist Ken Wafula has called for a special National Governing Council meeting in Thika tomorrow, whose agenda includes review and replacement of party leadership and a decision on the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate.
