ODM has demanded the electoral agency halts the Sh2.5 billion tender award for printing of ballot papers to a Dubai-based company. It wants the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to initiate transparent, foolproof and properly secured tendering. The tender was awarded to Al Ghurair printing firm.The Orange party alleged that state-sponsored mercenaries are being recruited to join the ICT department at the IEBC secretariat to manipulate election results in next year s polls.In a statement signed by director of elections Junet Mohamed, ODM questioned why the IEBC is in a hurry to procure 130 million ballot papers, election declaration forms and poll registers, for an election only expected a year later .The party said it is surprised that the IEBC has already started procuring ballot papers before voter registration is completed and the actual number of registered voters published.According to the contract terms, Al Ghurair is to supply the ballot papers within 21 days after the window for political parties to nominate their candidates closes on May 8, three months to the August 8 elections.The Dubai printer was the only one out of nine bidders that went past the technical evaluation stage and was thus picked automatically. The party demanded full disclosure of the directors of the company, including names of the local agents.
