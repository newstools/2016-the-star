A case to block the construction of a megacity in Vipingo, Kilifi county, was yesterday withdrawn under unclear circumstances by some residents.The residents from Mtwapa, Junju and Mavueni filed the case at the High Court in Malindi.They sought a permanent injunction refraining Rea Vipingo and Vipingo Estates from selling more than 11,000 acres earmarked for the project.Residents who arrived in their numbers for the ruling were surprised to hear there was no case because those who filed the petition were unwilling to continue with the case.Angry residents engaged Nicholas Wanyepe, one of those who spearheaded the withdrawal of the case, in a heated debate outside the Malindi law courts, accusing him of interfering with the case. Wanyepe had a hard time explaining why the case was withdrawn. The residents accused him of colluding with tycoons and powerful politicians who bribed him to withdraw the case at the expense of the poor.Kilifi Deputy Governor Kennedy Kamto calmed the situation and urged parties to stop fighting among themselves.He urged them to meet and come up with a solution. There is no need of fighting. Let's stick to our agenda of seeking justice to reclaim the land, he said.The residents moved to court to compel the National Land Commission, the Kilifi government and the Lands ministry to nullify and revoke tittle deeds issued to Centum and other investors. This was after lease agreements issued to Rea Vipingo Plantation and Vipingo Estates expired.In an affidavit, residents said they were not consulted when land was sold to Centum, saying they fear being displaced once the project starts.They also want Vipingo Estates to stop selling their land or donating it to any person other than the local communities.Confusion started when Mujuma, an umbrella body of residents from Mtwapa, Junju and Mavueni who filed the case felt that the affidavit had some shortcomings as advised by their lawyers.Kamto urged the community refile the case as advised by legal experts.He said Rea Vipingo should not have allocated the land to Centum.The residents later held a meeting in Junju ward and urged the President to intervene for residents to be settled.They also want Vipingo Ridge to open all the closed roads connecting Malindi to Mombasa Highway and bring down a perimeter wall stopping them from accessing a water point.The residents plan to sign a petition to reclaim their land.
