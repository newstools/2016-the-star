The 2013 world 3000m steeplechase champion Milka Chemos has revealed she will be upgrading to the 5000m and 10000m instead of the water and barrier race she is best known for.Chemos, who was yesterday appointed the Athletics Kenya athletes representative, has been out of competition with a spinal injury, which forced her out of the 2015 Worlds and 2016 Olympic Games. The injury affected me so much and it is such a great thing that I can even afford to smile again, said Chemos, who had to seek treatment abroad. I am now fully recovered and my focus is on the 2017 World Championships. I am yet to know which among the two races to put emphasis on but I will make the decision with time. The decorated National Police Service runner boosts of a number of medals including 2012 Olympic Games bronze, another bronze at the 2009 Berlin and 2011 Daegu world championships, 2013 (gold) and 2014 (silver) Commonwealth Games and 2010 Continental Cup silver. I wouldn t wish to endure the kind of pain that I went through, again, and that is why I have opted to do flat races as opposed to the steeple where I had to jump a lot, she observed. Chemos absence has seen the rise of world champion Hyvin Kiyeng and IAAF Diamond League trophy winner for 2016.
