We wanted to be in the semis. The game was a simple analysis,&rdquo; said Ouma on the CAF online.He added: &ldquo;We got a chance and failed to score. Mali got the same chance and they scored. We got good chances to score but fantastic goal-keeping from Mali denied us. Sometimes you need luck in a game. Our aim is to take the most from every game. We still have a game against Nigeria and there is nothing like resting key players. The players who are fit will play against Nigeria. We have to throw in what we have in the last game.&rdquo;Both teams went into Wednesday match having lost their opening matches and both needed to win to resurrect their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals but it was Mali who had the last laugh with a 3-1 win against the Kenyans, who were debuting in the event.Mali were humiliated 6-0 by title holders Nigeria and will now need to win against Ghana in the final Group &lsquo;B&rsquo; match tomorrow to be assured of a slot in the last four.Sebe Coulibaly scored a brace in the 37th and 62nd minute while Bassira Toure netted the third goal for the Malians in the 50th minute. Cheris Avilia scored the consolation goal for the Kenya in the 77th minute .Kenya, who displayed good performance against Ghana despite losing, were a pale shadow of themselves against their West Africa opponents on Wednesday. Mali on the other hand, showed huge improvement and came into the match with a lot of confidence. Kenya were unsettled throughout the match and had an open chance barely six minutes into the match but Mary Kinuthia failed to utilise it. Mali continued with their bright start and could have scored in the 24th minute through Toure but her efforts were cleared by Carolyne Anyango.Mali&rsquo;s continued to pile pressure and their efforts paid off in the 37th minute when Coulibaly lifted the ball over the line to score with Kenyan keeper Samantha Akinyi well beaten heading into the breather.
