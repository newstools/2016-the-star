The Northeastern regional coordinator yesterday directed the Garissa county security committee to arrest a businessman who fenced off a water supply area.Speaking to the press in Garissa town, Mohamud Saleh directed the security committee headed by county commissioner James Kianda to pull down the wall.He said the main tanks are a public utility that supply water to the entire Garissa town and nobody should interfere.Sources told the Star the county commissioner has written to the Garissa Water and Sewerage Company, but there has not been any response.The security agencies are looking into the possibility of county officials colluding with the private developer. It s impossible for anyone to fence off main water supply tanks without the knowledge of county officials, the source said.Efforts to get comments from Abdi Hussein, the acting Gawasco MD, were unsuccessful.Calls did not go through, and he did not respond to messages. In November, the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Programme launched the excavation of three water pans in Fafi and Ijara subcounties, two areas worst hit by drought, to reduce shortage.Coordinator Jelle Ibrahim said it would take at least a month for the three pans to fill with water. He urged the community to fence the water pans to keep away animals. The programme is meant to build the resilience of the people so that they can develop their own coping mechanisms and utilise natural resources, he said.
