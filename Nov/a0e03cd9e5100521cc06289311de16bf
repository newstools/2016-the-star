Leaders from Kilifi have criticised the government for taking advantage of residents hunger and using relief food as a campaign tool.Led by Governor Amason Kingi, they said Cabinet Secretaries who visit the county to distribute relief food have been campaigning for Jubilee, urging residents to support the government if they want to get development projects. Speaking at Tsangatsini trading centre on Saturday, where he distributed food, Kingi said Jubilee is using relief food as bait.He was accompanied by Senator Stewart Madzayo, Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga and Rabai MP William Kamoti. They criticised Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and his Devolution counterpart Mwangi Kiunjuri for hiring two helicopters to distribute water and relief food.On Friday, the two visited Tana River and Jaribuni to launch the drought mitigation programme. They donated 1,200 bags of maize and six trucks of water. The food was distributed by youths dresses in T-shirts labelled Vijana na Jubilee. It is shameful for CSs to purport to be distributing food and then turn it into a campaign rally. The government should feed its people without giving any conditions, Kingi said.
