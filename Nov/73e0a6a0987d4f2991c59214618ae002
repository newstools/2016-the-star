That legacy has greatly strengthened the relationship between our countries and underpinned excellent political relationships over many years.The Irish have a long tradition of travel, from the missionaries of the 6th and the 7th centuries, who journeyed to Europe (and reputedly to the Americas), up to later times when famine and poverty forced people to emigrate. Today an estimated 70 million people worldwide claim Irish ancestry.Many Irish people migrated to Kenya. Some were missionaries. Some were driven by a sense of adventure. Others saw business opportunities.Others volunteered or worked with international organisations. Many Irish people stayed and made their home here.The Irish community in Kenya at a 1916 commemorative event earlier this year. /COURTESYAnd that&rsquo;s not surprising. There is a lot that brings us together. Kenya and Ireland are both endowed with great natural beauty and wealth. We both have had painful histories of colonisation.We both value a rich tradition and respect community and culture. Over the past 100 years we have struggled to build free and democratic societies.In Ireland, the year 1916 was an important milestone in that struggle when a group of like-minded poets, teachers and socialists staged a rebellion for independence.The Easter Rising was a military failure but, even as its leaders were being executed, it served to accelerate the process of gaining Irish independence in 1922.One hundred years later, the Embassy of Ireland in Kenya decided to commemorate that pivotal moment by capturing the dimensions of the Irish presence in Kenya since 1916.We have worked very closely with the Irish community in Kenya and many Kenyan friends, to gather letters, documents, photographs and stories that faithfully represent the contribution and engagement of the Irish in Kenya over this time.Some of the earliest Irish missionaries to Kenya (1920s). /COURTESYThe Exhibition 100 Years &ndash; the Irish in Kenya is being launched in the National Museum, Nairobi today.The Exhibition takes the form of 15 banner presentations.
