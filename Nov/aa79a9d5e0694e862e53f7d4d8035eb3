Sixty KNH specialists have successfully separated Siamese twins born two years ago, in a 23-hour operation that was the first in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa.The sarcophagus twins born at a Meru hospital were joined at the sacral region of the lower spine.Head of pediatric surgery Fred Kabuni said on Wednesday that the main aim of the procedure was to separate the babies, close their wounds and create stomachs for them.He said they will undergo four more reconstructive surgeries after their wounds heal."I am very proud of my team. The journey had been long but successful," he said. "The twins will be checked after one month."Kabuni said they waited two years to perform the surgery to allow the development of key organs, and muscle strong enough for surgery.The twins are recovering at the hospital's intensive care unit.Among those involved in the surgery were plastic surgeons, anaesthetists, neurosurgeons and nurses.They said they will reconstruct the children's skins, genitalia, anal canal and bowel in subsequent operations.
