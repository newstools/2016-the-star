DP William Ruto's spokesman David Mugonyi on Wednesday filed a complaint with the police against Suna East MP Junet Mohamed.Mugonyi told police that Junet had told a friend that he was going to deal with him personally for crafting a press statement linking his family to the Sh1.6 billion NYS scam.Mugonyi said Junet made the allegations during a live interview on Citizen Television's Big Question on Tuesday night.The spokesman denied authoring the statement, which was read by Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa showing that Junet was a beneficiary at the height of the NYS scam.But Junet told the Star on phone that he issued no such threat.The MP said on Wedneday that he has never met Mugonyi and has no contacts with him."He must be a mad man speaking on behalf of his masters who sent him to craft the malicious statement," Junet said."I do not know him and have never met him. He should provide evidence that I made such threats," he added.On Tuesday, Ichung'wa said two companies linked to Junet received Sh129 million from the National Youth Service.He was accompanied by other Jubilee MPs in Parliament.They tabled documents showing that Zeighma Enterprises Limited, linked to Junet, and Faraza Ltd, linked to his sister Hafsa Nur, received Sh70,780,000 and Sh58,300,300 respectively.More on this: Junet Mohamed received Sh129 million from NYS - Jubilee MPsThey said the two companies were paid for various dubious contracts, most which were smuggled into the country from Pakistan through the port of Kisimayu.
