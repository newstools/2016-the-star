Nairobi governor Evans Kidero on Saturday donated 23 water tanks of 10,000litrescapacity to various youth and women groups in Kibera slums.The governor presided over the handing over at Undugu grounds in Kibera.The tanks were purchased by the County Government for use in slum areas to harvest water. "Today I have come to give you water tanks. These tanks will help you store water for future use so that you can have clean water. Please store them and maintain them well so that they can be of help to you and your children," Kidero said.The event, however, ended in disarray after youths turned violent as they opposed their local MCA Maurice Akuk.Akuk did not manage to deliver his speech."We want Akuk to go. Akuk must go because he has let us down. Even in today's event, no local leader was consulted and that's an insult to us," the youths chanted.Over the past years, provision of water in the slum areas of Nairobi has been problematic due to illegal connections.Kidero also promised the area residents that he will organize for a mass Harambee for the different women groups in the area so that they can get money for income generating activities.The governor did not get a chance to hand over all the tanks to different groups as the session turned chaotic due to the heckling of Akuk.This forced the Governor to take over the microphone and be the MC as well as the guest.However, as soon as he finished delivering his speech, Kidero was whisked away by his guards into his car and drove away.The Kibera youth then carted away all the tanks by rolling them.In the process, some of the tanks were destroyed and several cars damaged after being hit by the tanks.
