Nominated Senator Paul Njoroge is the latest candidate to declare in interest in the Nakuru governor's seat.Njoroge said he is ready to battle it out with veteran politicians who have declared interest in the seat in next year's election.The Senator, who is representing People Living with Disabilities, challenged Governor Kinuthia Mbugua to list his development track record."There is nothing we can pinpoint that stands out as being done by Mbugua. He does not have a clear track record of the development he brought about since he was elected four years ago," Njoroge said on Monday.He promised to offer transparent leadership to the county. I feel that I am better suited to lead the county. Our development record under the current leadership has been poor yet we boast of being one of the most resource filled county," he said."We have a vast tourism industry, we generate enough power to feed the nation and we have the best human resource and yet we have millions of people still languishing in poverty, he added.Among those Njoroge will be up against are NTSA chair and one time Nakuru MP Lee Kinyanjui, former Nacada chair John Mututho, and Nakuru Senator James Mungai.Njoroge also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to compel DP William Ruto to step down over the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal.Njoroge has been at loggerheads with the DP after his pronouncement that Central region would not automatically back Ruto in the 2022 general election.He accused Ruto of attempting to blackmail Kikuyus to support his presidential bid.More on this: Protesters 'burn senator' for telling Ruto to stop blackmailing CentralFollowing the remarks, TNA disowned the senator, saying he had no authority to speak on Ruto's bid.In April, Njoroge skipped an event celebrating the end of the DP's cases at the International Criminal Court.He travelled to Kakamega for Ford Kenya Moses Wetang'ula's presidential bid launch.
