Kenya Pipeline&rsquo;s middle blocker Triza Atuka and Kenya Prisons&rsquo; men&rsquo;s team left attacker Jairus Bett are the 2016 Kenya Volleyball Federation league play-offs Most Valuable Players. The two were outstanding for their respective clubs during the just ended play-off which ended over the weekend at the Makande Hall, Mombasa. Atuka played key role forthe Pipeline as they retained the trophy for the third year running while Bett helped his side to reclaim the title from their local nemesis General Service Unit.Pipeline who are coached by Japheth Munala, scooped the title from their domestic rival Kenya Prisons in 2013 and they have since won it back-to-back. Atuka, a national women&rsquo;s team player, said the award goes along way to show that hard work pays.She said: &ldquo;I am humbled. I have always put my best foot forward during training and I am happy the hard work and my efforts have paid off. Of course, all this might not havehappened if it wasn&rsquo;t for the support I received from my team-mates.&rdquo; She continued: &ldquo;Retaining the trophy a record three times in a row is something to be proud of. Our focus shifts to next year&rsquo;s Africa Club Championship. This year, we dropped to third we hope to bounce back.&rdquo;On the other hand, Prisons&rsquo; men last won the KVF title in 2014 before GSU dethroned them last season.Other winners in the KVF award gala night saw Prisons&rsquo; Jane Wacu bag the best setter award. Team-mate Edith Wisa scooped the best blocker, while Nairobi Water&rsquo;s Ruth Chelangat was feted best attacker.
