Police have launched an operation in Mombasa targeting women accomplices of drugs barons.In a recent Likoni crackdown, four dealers, including two women, escaped by swimming across shallow water.This comes as residents allege only five Likoni officers are fighting drugs, while others pocket bribes.Residents did not name them.An infuriated Mombasa county commissioner Evens Achoki yesterday said women are used as drug peddlers because they are least suspected. He said drug hauls are stored in their homes before being distributed to other peddlers and users. The drugs are cut and placed into small packs. Most of the women live in congested neighbourhoods, making it difficult to detect their activities, he said.Achoki led heavily armed officers to search drug dens in the Likoni area and they set ablaze two makeshift homes.Four drug dealers, including two women, escaped the dragnet by swimming away. Expect regular crackdowns. We ll flush them out, he said. Achoki said.
