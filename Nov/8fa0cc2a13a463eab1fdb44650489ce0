Machakos residents have been warned against reelecting the 31 MCAs who went for a trip to Tanzania during Governor Alfred Mutua&rsquo;s impeachment motion, making the bid flop. Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti (pictured)said the MCAs have failed to represent the electorate due to personal interests. She spoke during a thanksgiving ceremony in Mavoko on Saturday.
