You are all much more important than those animals your parents seek as they marry you off,&rdquo; she said. She asked men to allow their girls to go to school and women to stop being ignorant by agreeing to everything their husbands say. &ldquo;Women please stand firm and protect your daughters,&rdquo; she reiterated.Photo caption: Anti FGM Board Chair Linah Jebii Kilimo presents a certificate to Belinda Chepkasi who was among the 96 Pokot girls who graduated with different courses from St. Elizabeth Girls Centre in West Pokot after they were rescued from FGM and early marriages .
