President Uhuru Kenyatta has said contractors who fail to complete work on time will be blacklisted from all government tenders.He said the government would not compromise on lazy contractors who intend to take advantage of public projects to enrich themselves."It is time contractors uphold high quality workmanship or be blacklisted from carrying out projects in Kenya. There is no need for contractors to ask for jobs if they know well they will abandon the work halfway," he said on Tuesday.He said such delays undermine efforts to improve the lives of citizens and create opportunities for employing the youth.He said the government was paying special attention to the implementation and completion of projects "that create a direct positive impact on the lives of Kenyans".He said the government will not relent in its commitment to open up interior parts of the county for development."The upgrading and improvement of roads in all parts of our country will spur development and improve economic status of our people," he said. Uhuru was speaking after commissioning the Kangema-Gacharage road in Kiharu constituency, Murang'a county. He said the 33-kilometre road, which was constructed at a cost of Sh4.1 bilion, will boost marketing of farm produce including coffee and livestock products among others. "My government has at the same time set aside Sh2.4billion as bailout for coffee farmers in the region in the current financial year," he said. "This bailout has been injected into the coffee sector to help farmers pay their loans and get title deeds for their lands," he added.More on this: Uhuru writes off Sh2bn coffee debt owed to financial institutions
