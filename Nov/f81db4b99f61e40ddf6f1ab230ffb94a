Communication solutions provider Safaricom is looking to leverage on discounted prices for select Huawei flagships and budged devices to increase the reach of its 4G network.This comes as Huawei announced a 10 percent discount on some of its devices retailing in Safaricom shops countrywide during celebrations to mark 14 years of partnership between the two companies.Safaricom's Head of Department, Enterprise Sales &amp; Retention for the Nairobi West region Victor Ngumo, said despite a progressive improvement of 4G uptake, its roll-out has been affected by low availability of affordable 4G devices.Ngumo however noted that with Huawei releasing more affordable 4G enabled devices, the gap will be bridged.Speaking during the celebration Huawei's Senior Director of Service Function Chaining Bob Wang Tie, said the company is keen on ensuring that more customers access smartphones and will offer competitive prices in the market. Huawei s core value is putting the customers at the apex of everything we do as a business, which translates to ensuring that Safaricom gets the best state of the art equipment and software, services, quick deployment time and operational flexibility, Tie said.Wang added that the two companies will continue to strengthen their existing partnership by innovating more on devices and networks respectively to address consumer challenges at the market place.Some of the devices that will be selling at discounted rates include Huawei GR3, Mate 8, P9, Y3II and Y360.
