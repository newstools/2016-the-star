Agricultural production is likely to drop in the coming months owing to uneven rainfall in the country, a monthly survey by Stanbic Bank suggested yesterday.Purchasing Managers Index indicates bad weather has badly hit the key food growing counties of Bungoma, Busia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kakamega, Nakuru, Nandi, Narok, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu and Migori. Moreover, the slowdown in credit growth also poses as a downside risk to the promise of the private sector, Stanbic Bank s regional economist Jibran Qureishi (pictured) said yesterday citing the index.The index shows business conditions improved modestly in October, with output and new orders rising at relatively subdued rates. The pace of growth in new work, however, remained robust overall, helping both employment and input.
