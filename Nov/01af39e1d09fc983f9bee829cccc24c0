AS we head towards the general election it is expected that while the Opposition uses its mobilisation skills and local networks around the country to spread the word on its behalf, the incumbent shall, as is the tradition, rely heavily on the State machine and structures to popularise its reelection agenda.Main story: Jubilee using civil servants to prepare for 2017As the hunt for votes gears up as we approach the election year, the role of the National Government Administrative Officers will rear its ugly head yet again, exposing the feeble underbelly of the relationship between the National and County governments. The constitutional mantra of interdependence between these two levels of government will be tested.It is at this stage that a restructured provincial administration will either show proof that it can, intends to and has shaken off its former, post-colonial public image, or will, as is widely expected, take up its traditional monster-like, authoritarian role and push the government s political agenda. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 re-ordered the nature of Kenya s post-colonial state, it deconstructed the logic of state power and rule, deconstructed the imperial presidency and its arm of authoritarian rule the provincial administration.In the actualisation of self-governance administratively, the Constitution vested all county Executive authority in the County Executive Committee headed by an elected Governor and deputy.As representatives of the President at the grassroots, the provincial administration exercised upward accountability, being answerable to and serving at the pleasure of the President.Local leadership in the form of the CEC is accountable to the people; is the provincial administration, in addition to being answerable to the President, also answerable to the people as it purports to shake off its operational history?President Uhuru Kenyatta s action in 2014 to increase and delegate powers to the 47 county commissioners faced harsh criticism for its attempt to create two centres of power at the county level, pitting County Commissioner against Governor most notably in Mombasa county, where Nelson Marwa is perpetually at loggerheads with Governor Hassan Joho.It would, for instance, be fundamentally wrong for a county commissioner to go around saying, You need to join this government as it is the only one that will guarantee you development . There is no development you will get when you remain outside government. A statement such as this by a public officer meant to serve the citizenry impartially would be detrimental to the sensitive and delicate process of promoting interdependence.
