The wife of a school principal, who was found dead a week after going missing, is the prime suspect in the case, police have said.Police are holding Jane Muthoni, wife of the late Solomon Mwangi, who was the principal of Kiru Secondary School.Murang a county commissioner John Elungata said Muthoni, a principal at Ichachiri Boys' High School, was being held at Murang a police station.Elungata said the woman had taken Mwangi from their home near her school to Witeithie shopping centre on Saturday, a day before he was found dead.He noted on Monday that Karuntuma coffee estate where Mwangi's body was found is near the shopping centre.The commissioner further said Muthoni picked her husband from his school in Mathioya using a hired car.Elungata said people at the school said the car the woman had on that day was not the one she normally used. We are also holding the car becauset it may have been used by the suspect and other people to carry out the heinous crime, he said.The commissioner said they believed Muthoni took her husband to unknown people at Witeithie.The commissioner said a watchman found the body at the coffee estate and notified officers at Juja police station.Elungata noted the body was found severely mutilated; Mwangi's hand were tied, his face badly bruised and some of his teeth missing."From the state of the body, the principal was strangled and suffered serious assault before losing his life, he said.Read: Missing Kiru school principal found dead after week of frantic searchElunga said it was also suspicious that the woman, who lives at Gatundu, wanted to record a statement at Kasarani police station when her husband was reported missing.He said she did so despite knowing a case had been opened at the Murang a station.Some sources claimed Muthoni had been having an affair with a CID officer attached to Kasarani police station.Another source she suspected that her husband was cheating on her with a woman who operates an M-Pesa shop at Kiriaini shopping center near his school. So many other people suspected to have participated in the murder, and who have been repeatedly mentioned during our investigations, including the police officer, are being investigated, said Elungata.He said the couple had a rocky relationship but were trying to work on their marriage.The commissioner said they were also looking into claims that Mwangi s daughter was violently robbed of her phone by a knife-wielding man, a few days after he went missing.It is alleged that the daughter was in constant communication with a teacher at Kiru secondary school and that the phone may have had vital information concerning the case.Elungata said police will file a request at Murang'a law courts so they can hold the suspect until they complete investigations. I am appealing to all Murang a principals and the public to give any information they have to help us arrest other suspects, he added.
