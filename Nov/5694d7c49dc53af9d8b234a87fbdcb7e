Cord leader Raila Odinga loves Kenya and will not allow it to be plunged into an economic crisis, that&rsquo;s why he persistently criticises the state when it does not fight graft, his brother has said.Nominated MP Oburu Oginga told President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to fight corruption in their administration.Oburu spoke at Nyawita Secondary School in Bondo during a funds drive at the weekend.&ldquo;Kenyans would have not known about the numerous scandals in this country were it not for Raila, who has constantly unearthed the ill deeds of the government,&rdquo; the lawmaker said.Uhuru and Ruto should listen when the former PM speaks on corruption, because his claims are true, he said. Oburu added that Raila&rsquo;s comments should not warrant insults.&ldquo;Raila has only been raising mistakes on issues of national importance and those which the President could rectify,&rdquo; he said. Oburu urged Uhuru to crack the whip on corrupt officials in his administration.
