President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Tanzania counterpart John Magufuli yesterday launched the Southern bypass terming it an "economic and social road".The two presidents spoke at the Ngong Road/Lenana interchange as Magufuli concluded his two-day first state visit to Kenya.Uhuru and Magufuli said the 28.6 kilometre Nairobi Southern by-pass constructed at a cost of Sh18 billion will help decongest the Kenyan city."It used to take transporters on the Northern Corridor over three hours driving through Nairobi. With the completion of this road, the journey has been reduced to half an hour," Uhuru said.Terming the Nairobi Southern by-pass road as both an &ldquo;economic and social road&rdquo;, Magufuli said its completion is a major boost to road users and residents living along it.The Tanzanian leader said designated areas should be set aside along the road for small traders to do business.&ldquo;I look forward to the day when I will make a stopover along the Southern by-pass to buy food from hawkers instead of going to a big hotel for the same. This will promote and improve the welfare of the ordinary citizens,&rdquo; Magufuli said.He reassured that Tanzania will continue working with Kenya to improve lives of the people of the two countries.Uhuru said his administration has also embarked on expanding other roads in the city to address traffic congestion in the city, saying the main aim is to benefit ordinary citizens.The Kenyan leader also praised his Tanzanian counterpart for supporting infrastructure projects that will boost the fraternal ties between the two countries.He cited the Arusha &ndash; Holili &ndash; Taveta road that the two leaders launched last year as an example of the infrastructure projects that are geared towards promoting the cooperation between Kenya and Tanzania.&ldquo;We also expect that next year we will launch the construction of the Malindi &ndash; Lunga Lunga road on the Kenya side and the Horohoro &ndash; Tanga &ndash; Bagamoyo &ndash; Dar es Salaam road on the Tanzanian side,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Saying Kenya and Tanzania are more than just neighbours, President Kenyatta said it was the responsibility of the leaders to unite the people of the two countries.&ldquo;I believe in President Magufuli, Kenya has a brother and a friend who is ready to support the joint development of our two countries,&rdquo; Uhuru said.Recalling the close relations between Kenya and Tanzania that was initiated by the two countries founding fathers, Magufuli emphasized the need for the two countries to uphold their unity.Deputy President William Ruto, several Cabinet Secretaries, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Dagoreti South Member of Parliament Dennis Waweru also attended the launch.
