The Kenya Forestry Research institute is developing a masterplan to enable sustainable utilisation of mangrove trees.This follows the massive loss of mangroves along the Coastal line that forced the government to ban cutting of the trees.Authorities have revealed that the drought being experienced now could be as a result of the destruction, though research is year to prove that.Kefri board chairman Dr Sammy Latema said that since 1985, the nation has lost 18 per cent of mangrove cover due to destruction.Speaking in Lamu after paying a courtesy call to the governor Issa Timammy last week, the chairman said every year the county loses 0.8 per cent of the mangrove forest. The rate of replacement is not as big as what we are losing. That s why we are developing a plan to enable sustainable utilisation, he said.SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONSDr Latema their aim is to use a scientific way of managing the mangroves to prevent the loss.He said even though climate change and global warming are a global problem, the effects from such destructions are being felt locally. There are increased incidents of drought in Lamu and the Coastal area. We are doing research and in three months will have the facts on the cause of change of climate, he said.The chairman said their aim is climate adaptation. They want to determine how to increase forest cover using the right trees and technology. We want to plant trees that will boost the socio economic activity of the areas, he said.Dr Latema said following devolution, they need to work with the devolved units in areas with mangroves to ensure they conserve the trees.TOTAL BAN BASELESS He said the total ban on mangroves is not based on facts and figures. That is why the plan will be able to inform the government on the need to have a partial ban.Most of the mangrove forest cover, he said, are in private land or communal land.The KefrI chairman said they are setting up a five-acre plot for research purposes in Lamu.Governor Issa Timamy said he was delighted to receive the Kefri delegation and welcomed the setting up of its regional offices in Lamu.He said 60 per cent of the mangrove forest cover in the Coast region is in Lamu, and assured the board of maximum cooperation. If all government institutions were like Kefri, who moved so fast to set up regional headquarters in Lamu, it would be wonderful, he said.
