Nairobi deputy speaker Ken Ng ondi yesterday requested the EACC to question him next week over a fistfight and melee during the failed bid to impeach Governor Evans Kidero.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission summoned Ng ondi and 12 MCAs in a letter dated October 1. He presided over the stormy session on September 29. The EACC asked MCAs to appear before its detectives between November 4 and November 10. The commission is investigating the allegations of unethical conduct at the Nairobi county assembly chamber ... the commission would like you to shed light on the matter and record a statement, reads the letter.The ward representatives traded blows, threw furniture, splashed water and tore clothing during tabling of the motion sponsored by ODM s Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang wara to impeach Kidero.Although many MCAs supported the motion, they suddenly fell silent and stayed away, so there was no quorum.Nominated MCAs Alexina Mudi and Kayole South s Elizabeth Manyala will appear at Integrity Centre on Monday. On Tuesday it will be the turn of Catherine Okoth, Florence Athembo and Joyce Nabwire, all nominated.On November 9, Peter Imwatok (Makongeni), Rose Kula and Tabitha Ngigirigi (nominated) will appear. Those who will appear before the EACC on November 10 are Maurice Gari (Nairobi West), Peter Oluoch (Huruma) and Wilfred Odalo (Mabatini).Speaker Alex Magelo and Clerk Jacob Ngwele were questioned by investigators Derrick Kaisha and Jackson Agai last month. Ngwele provided CCTV footage and video clip. I have told them to ask my deputy what happened because I was not the chair on that particular day, Magelo told journalists afterwards. In the motion, Nyang wara accused Kidero of incompetence and failure of leadership.
