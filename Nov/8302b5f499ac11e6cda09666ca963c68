I can confirm that this report was handed to the President. I can also confirm that the President had some questions he wanted to be answered, and some clarifications he wanted to be made in respect of the report, Esipisu said.He added that State House expects the Ministry to return the report to the President when these matters have been dealt with to enable him to reflect on the actions required.In August, chairman of the disbanded National Olympic Committee Kenya Kipchoge Keino said he wants the law to take its course on the Rio Olympics scandal. Addressing the press at Eldoret International Airport from Rio, Keino said the government should get to the bottom of the matter by applying the rule of law. Sports CS Hassan Wario disbanded the committee and transferred its operations to Sports Kenya following controversial issues surrounding the Team Kenya for the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil.
