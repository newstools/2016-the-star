Yatta MP Francis Mwangagi wants Parliament to probe the forcible eviction of a community from a disputed land in his constituency.In a petition to the National Assembly, the MP yesterday called for investigations that include the National Land Commission, the Ministry of Lands and the House Lands Committee.Unidentified people have been raiding Kivingoni sub-location in Ndalani ward to intimidate residents into leaving the land.The parcels of land have no title deeds, but residents have lived on the property for more than 40 years. These people have not only been chasing residents from their land but have also been destroying homes in the process, reads the petition in part.Mwangangi said the raids have increased tension between the two neighbouring communities and this could lead to ethnic violence. He wants title deeds issued.
