Homa Bay County Referral Hospital is on the spot over negligence following the death of an expectant woman last month.Kasipul MP Oyugi Mgwanga decried massive corruption at the county which has led to poor service delivery to residents.Magwanga took issue with the county government leadership for reneging on their core responsibility as provided for in the constitution and were busy enjoying public resources as people suffer. It is unfortunate and sad that residents are dying of preventable diseases or complication yet money meant for drugs in hospitals are being looted by few selfish individuals, he said.Magwanga, while reacting over the alleged fight that broke out last Friday among 40 elected Homa Bay MCAs over a cash handout of Sh4million, faulted the leaders for pursuing personal gains at the expense of public good.The legislator said those looting public funds should be investigated and charged. He added that the fight over looted money shows that those involved are being haunted for dirty deals. Bloods money will always haunt them and wreck havoc. Just watch this space, Magwanga told the Star on the phone.He accused the county government led by governor Cyprian Awiti over massive corruption instead of fostering development growth to improve the lives of residents.Wangchieng MCA Peter Kaula confirmed that there was a fight following sharp differences among MCAs on who is best suited to be the governor in the next year s elections not sharing the handouts. It was all about who is supporting who for the governor s seat and not over handouts from the executive as alleged. Some MCAs were even drunk and could not sustain the argument which required sobriety prompting the fight as others hurled expletives, Kaula said.He said some MCAs were in support of governor aspirant Sam Wakiaga with others for Magwanga while others were supporting the incumbent Cyprian Awiti, whom he also supports.But sources at the scene confirmed that the fight was over the money. The source who sought anonymity claimed that the amount of money the MCAs were expecting was delayed and reduced from Sh20million to Sh4million, causing the fight. It is further alleged that the MCAs got furious after it emerged that an MP, who is an ODM official, got his fair share of Sh1.5 million earlier enough before heading to a fundraiser The money was collected from a local bank by a senior officer at county finance office who drove in a black Prado where he first met the MP at around 9am before sorting out the MCAs representative later, the source disclosed.This came at the sad case in point which happened more than three weeks ago when Irene Adhiambo, 28, and expectant mother died due to lack of adequate maternal facility and negligence in the referral hospital.
