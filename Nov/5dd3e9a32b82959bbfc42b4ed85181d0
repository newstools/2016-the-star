KCB captain Andrew Amonde, fullback Darwin Mukidza, and new signing Martin Owila will likely miss out as the former Kenya Cup champions travel to face Kakamega-based Western Bulls tomorrow during the first league match at the Bull Ring at 4.00pm.The three are in the national Sevens training camp ahead of the World Sevens Series. Lock Oliver Mang&rsquo;eni will also not feature due to personal commitments.The match earlier scheduled to be played at KCB&rsquo;s backyard has been moved to Kakamega due to the ongoing renovations at the ground.KCB&rsquo;s team manager Ronnie Kangeta insists the change of venue will not affect his team&rsquo;s performance against their tricky western counterparts.Kangeta has, however, made little changes in the team that played during the Impala Floodlit final match against Impala. Ken Moseti will replace Billy Isabwa, who is still injured and will play key role in facilitating the movement of the ball between the backs and forwards. Also included are Oscar Simiyu at prop and David Chenge at eighth man.&ldquo;Western Bulls gave us a hard time the last time we met and this time-round, we will not give time to settle. They are very physical and we will approach them differently this time by focusing on wide play. We will try to make the game as simple as possible by avoiding too much contact and maximising on scoring opportunities,&rdquo;&ldquo;Unfortunately, some of our players will miss out but we managed to maintain a big number that played during the Impala Floodlit tournament and I believe the selected players will rise to the occasion,&rdquo; he added.
