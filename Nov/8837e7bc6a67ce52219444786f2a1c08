Bungoma residents are up in arms as their MCAs allegedly used more than Sh3.2 million for their end-year party in the last financial year.They said they will vote their leaders out come the August 8, 2017 general election. The Governor is Kenneth Lusaka.Roniso Kisunia from Matulo area, Webuye, said the ward representatives should have used the money on projects that would have benefited the people.''We are not happy about how members are using the cash they ought to have used it to build roads, bridges or even help educate needy children,'' he said."How can they be using millions to celebrate by eating and drinking silly, yet we as a county have more pressing issues that need to be addressed?"Tom Wasike, a boda boda operator from Bungoma town, said the MCAs point fingers at the executive yet they have failed residents in their oversight and legislative roles.''We want residents from every ward to ensure they vote in sober-minded MCAs, who will represent our needs in a proper way at the assembly, instead of electing tumbocrats," he said.A report by Auditor General Edward Ouko on the county assembly's financial operations showed MCAs spent Sh3,258,500 on the party.The report further said the assembly also had an outstanding bill of Sh45,260,687 as at June 2015.Read: Five Bungoma MPs want Lusaka outAlso read: Uproar over Sh109,000 wheelbarrow in Bungoma
