It is a common sight in Kenyan politics &ndash; a politician walking into an event surrounded by rowdy, shabby, sometimes drunken, young men. Not a few scuffles have broken Not so for Bungoma Senate aspirant David Makali. He is going around surroundedby a bevy of beauties. He has been spotted in churches, at fundraisers, funerals and other events with the beautiful young women wearing T-shirts and caps printed with his image and name. They give out freebies with brochures outlining his agenda. The group takes photos and selfies and posts them on social media. Makali has promised to work closely with the youth to change the Bungoma leadership. He is the secretary general of the Labour Party of Kenya. Makali will run against Jubilee Party&rsquo;s Eubastus Mukhwana and businessman Lendrix Joseph. It is unclear whether former Webuye MP Musikari Kombo and former Bumula MP Bifwoli Wakoli will be in the race. Incumbent Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has announced he will run for President next year.
