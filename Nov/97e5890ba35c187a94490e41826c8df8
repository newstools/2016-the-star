Other Kenyan officials are also lobbying for Mohamed. She needs two-thirds of 50 AU votes. During the meeting in Algiers, Ruto assured the Algerian government of Kenya&rsquo;s position on the future of Western Sahara in the AU. &ldquo;We know what is happening about Western Sahara and its membership to the AU,&rdquo; he said.Efforts by Western Sahara to become an AU member have caused strained relations between Algeria and Morocco. The latter is opposed to its inclusion in the AU. But Kenya and Algeria support Western Sahara&rsquo;s membership.Ruto has visited Western and Northern African countries to seek support for Mohamed&rsquo;s candidacy. The countries include Chad, Ghana, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone.He will visit Mali and Nigeria. Nineteen Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa countries have already backed Mohamed.

Ruto and Koroma discussed the need for Kenya and Sierra Leone to harness trade and increase flights between them.Earlier, Ruto met Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and said her stewardship of ECOWAS fosters economic integration and creation of a single trading bloc. Ruto said this attests to the fact that women leaders can deliver.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident Amina Mohamed can complement her efforts as chairperson of the AU Commission,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want a new African Union leadership that will work round the clock to ensure Africa takes its rightful place in global affairs, development and furthers the continent&rsquo;s agenda to derive great benefit from interaction with the rest of the world.&rdquo;In Ghana, Ruto met President John Mahama.
