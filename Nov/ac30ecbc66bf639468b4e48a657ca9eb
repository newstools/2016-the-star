The High Court has compelled the Public Service Commission to interview university lecturer Dr Wilfrida Itolongo for the position of EACC chairperson.Justice Edward Muriithi (pictured) said the PSC and AG were unreasonable and violated Itolongo&rsquo;s rights. He prohibited the commission from recommending for appointment any candidate without interviewing Itolongo. She filed the suit last week, claiming she was not shortlisted because she raised corruption reports against a friend of PSC chairperson Margaret Kobia.
