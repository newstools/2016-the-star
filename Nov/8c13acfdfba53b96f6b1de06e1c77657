Thirty-five Machakos MCAs have threatened to sue Governor Alfred Mutua for defamation.During a rally at Mulu Mutisya and another one in Kitui last week, Mutua called the MCAs thieves in suits and prostitutes of poverty .MCAs want to impeach him and a motion will be debated tomorrow.Speaking at Katoloni on Sunday, the MCAs, led by deputy speaker Nathaniel Nganga, said the governor maligned them and demeaned their stature. I have heard him say he will take [Wiper leader] Kalonzo [Musyoka] to court for linking him to the abduction of [Siaya Governor Bernard] Kiala s daughter. I want to let him know that before he does that, we ll be the first to jail him for defaming us, Nganga said.The Ikombe ward representative said it was embarrassing for a governor to malign leaders for questioning his integrity and performance.The MCAs told Mutua to prove his allegations that they were given money by the Wiper Party to impeach him. We re not backing off from our agenda to send him home for failing to account for the county cash his administration has stolen, Mulolongo MCA Rachael Nduku said.It has emerged that 24 of the total 59 MCAs were flown to Tanzania at the weekend to strategise on scuttling the impeachment motion.Nominated MCA Christine Mwende said it is a big shame that a few ward representatives continue to allow Mutua to play with their minds, despite having known the truth. We ve information there are those of us who at the weekend were taken to Tanzania so they don t take part in the debate. We are telling them when the election time comes, let them also go to ask for votes in Tanzania because it seems they never care about the welfare of their people back here, she said.
