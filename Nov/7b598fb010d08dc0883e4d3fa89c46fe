At least 40 Kisii University students have been suspended following riots over school fees clearance that saw the university closed.Students who sought anonymity gave the Star the number on Tuesday but university spokesman Pauline Nyamwaka said she had only heard of 15. I don t have the exact number of students suspended because I don t sit in the senate," Nyamwaka told the Star by phone.She said they were sent home pending investigations and disciplinary action.Academic Affairs registrar Phillip Owino declined to give details saying he was in a meeting, but said the students were suspended for incitement and arson. Some were found with petrol, he said.Learners opposed their schoolmates' suspensions saying their case was not heard. They reported back from Monday and were required to clear school fees, pay a fine of Sh1, 800 and be accompanied by a parent or guardian.This was according to a notice placed in newspapers last week.The university was closed on October 18 after two days of unrest during which property in the institution and its neighbourhood was destroyed.Some 37 students were charged in a Kisii court following the riots and later released on bond.Read: 10 Kisii University campuses to closeAlso read: 10 arrested as Kisii University student protests turn violent
