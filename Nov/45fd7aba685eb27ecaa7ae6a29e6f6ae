Police and security officers from KPC stormed the MCA s home following a tip-off.They found children at the home who gave them a key to a house in which the material had been hidden. Armed police officers cordoned off the home and waited for the MCA to arrive and explain how stolen material got into his home. He did not turn up as he had promised and police are now looking for him, said Zachary Ombati, the Kenya Power chief security officer in Western region.Among the items recovered are transformers and other line construction materials vandalised from power lines. So far what we have recovered is material that can be used to set up another illegal line, Ombati said.The MCA was unavailable for comment.
