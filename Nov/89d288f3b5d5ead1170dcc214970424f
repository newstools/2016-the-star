Former Nacada chairman John Mututho has downplayed Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua's capabilities to steer the county to greater heights.Mututho, who wants to take over from Mbugua in 2017, said the latter can only serve best as a policeman and is unfit to be governor."Electing Mbugua as governor is like appointing Mututho to be a bishop in charge of Nakuru county," he told Molo residents on Sunday.Mututho further said Nakuru residents made a mistake when they voted for Mbugua in 2013; he said the Governor has done nothing tangible in terms of development four years down the line."Being a son of a squatter who was born in Molo, I am the best for the seat. I understand the plight of Nakuru residents and my previous posts confirm that I can deliver," he said. "Mbugua hails from Dagoretti. That is why he is swindling us out of our resources."Mututho said Nakuru has nothing to celebrate and cannot even showcase a single project initiated by the county government. He said the county is still where it was 50 years ago despite the receipt of Sh44 billion from the national government."That is why we should send this cop home," he said during the launch of campaigns by John Mbugua alias Turkana, a former street boy eying the Molo MCA seat.Mbugua blasted Mututho in January saying he had failed and did not deserve to hold any public office.He said the increase in drug use among youths was as a result of poor leadership, and that Nacada was one of the best government institutions until Mututho took over.Mre on this: Governor Mbugua blasts Mututho, says Nacada boss has failed Also read: Contest for Nakuru top seat down to Mbugua, Kinyanjui
