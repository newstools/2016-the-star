DPP Keriako Tobiko has turned down PAC's invitation to shed more light on the Sh1.6 billion NYS theft, saying some matters were under judgment.Nicholas Gumbo, National Assembly Public Accounts Committee chairman, asked Tobiko to appear before his team on October 27. The DPP was expected to appear on October 8.But in a letter dated Tuesday, the DPP turned down the request saying the matter under probe was before a competent court of law."Mr Chairman, you would be aware one of the matters, in respect of which I have been invited by your committee to appear and give evidence, is the subject of Criminal Case CMS Court Cr C No. 1905/2015 (republic-vs-Eng Peter Mangiti &amp; 24 others," Tobiko wrote in his refusal letter.He noted the matters are the theft of Sh791 million and the attempted theft of Sh695 million.The DPP further said the matter is "live" before a competent court and is scheduled for further hearing on November 28 and 30, and on December 1.Tobiko further noted that key suspects in the National Youth Service scandal, led by business people Beth Gethi and Josephine Kabura, are facing a second charge of money laundering."These matters are therefore not only subjudice, but there is also a real and grave danger that anything I might state or present before the committee...would be used by those being prosecuted," he said.The DPP further said that if he accepts the invitation, he will find himself litigating his cases before two different fora - as a witness before the committee and a prosecutor in court.The committee has so far questioned Gethi, Kabura, former Planning PS Peter Mang'iti and former NYS boss Nelson Githinji.Star witness Anne Waiguru, who is former Devoltuion Cabinet Secretary, gave her evidence on last Thursday, linking Deputy President William Ruto's allies to the NYS scam.Read: Waiguru links DP Ruto s office to NYS scandal
