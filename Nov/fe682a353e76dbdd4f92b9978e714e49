Homa Bay County Referral Hospital is
on the spot over negligence following the death of an expectant woman last
month. Kasipul MP Oyugi Mgwanga decried massive
corruption at the county which has led to poor service delivery to residents. Magwanga took issue with the county
government leadership for reneging on their core responsibility as provided for
in the constitution and were busy enjoying public resources as people suffer. “It is unfortunate and sad that residents
are dying of preventable diseases or complication yet money meant for drugs in
hospitals are being looted by few selfish individuals,” he said. Magwanga, while reacting over the
alleged fight that broke out last Friday among 40 elected Homa Bay MCAs over a
cash handout of Sh4million, faulted the leaders for pursuing personal gains at
the expense of public good. The legislator said those looting
public funds should be investigated and charged. He added that the fight over
looted money shows that those involved are being haunted for dirty deals. “Bloods money will always haunt them and wreck
havoc. Just watch this space,” Magwanga told the Star on the phone. He accused the county government led
by governor Cyprian Awiti over massive corruption instead of fostering
development growth to improve the lives of residents. Wangchieng MCA Peter Kaula confirmed
that there was a fight following sharp differences among MCAs on who is best
suited to be the governor in the next year’s elections not sharing the
handouts. “It was all about who is supporting who for
the governor’s seat and not over handouts from the executive as alleged. Some
MCAs were even drunk and could not sustain the argument which required sobriety
prompting the fight as others hurled expletives,” Kaula said. He said some MCAs were in support of
governor aspirant Sam Wakiaga with others for Magwanga while others were
supporting the incumbent Cyprian Awiti, whom he also supports. But sources at the scene confirmed
that the fight was over the money. The source who sought anonymity claimed that
the amount of money the MCAs were expecting was delayed and reduced from
Sh20million to Sh4million, causing the fight. It is further alleged that the MCAs
got furious after it emerged that an MP, who is an ODM official, got his fair
share of Sh1.5 million earlier enough before heading to a fundraiser “The money was collected from a
local bank by a senior officer at county finance office who drove in a black
Prado where he first met the MP at around 9am before sorting out the MCAs’
representative later,” the source disclosed. This came at the sad case in point which happened more than three weeks ago when Irene Adhiambo, 28,
and expectant mother died due to lack of adequate maternal facility and
negligence in the referral hospital.
