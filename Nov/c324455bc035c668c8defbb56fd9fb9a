Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has dismissed media reports that he could be backing down in the 2017 race for city governor. Sonko said that his course to dethrone Governor Evans Kidero is still on. "I wish to categorically state here and now that I have never, and will never support Kidero who is my competitor for the 2017 gubernatorial race," he said.The senator said that he reads malice and propaganda in the story suggesting that he could be angling for an alliance with Kidero."The story is only meant to portray me as a traitor having been recently appointed to the President Uhuru's presidential re-election campaign team," Sonko said. The two were spotted having lunch at Intercontinental hotel, Nairobi on Tuesday. Sonko said that they had a lunch with Kidero after both of them attended a parliamentary Standing Committee meeting on Roads and Transportation at Prugna Room, within the hotel. "The meeting was to build consensus on the Kenya Roads Bill (National Assembly Bill No 26 of 2015) and was attended by Governors and Senators among other top government officials," he said. He added that he will continue with the fight against corruption at City Hall as well as hold the governor accountable for all the monies received from the Exchequer and from locally generated revenue.Read: Kidero, Sonko meet for lunch, pledge to drive peaceful 2017 poll campaigns
