Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya yesterday defended the Jubilee administration against claims it plans to grab county land, calling some ODM leaders the real grabbers .He cited Senator Juma Boy as among leaders with court cases. Last month in Lunga Lunga, the senator said the Jubilee administration is particularly targeting county land, where leases are about to expire. Some ODM leaders have joined hands to fight me. The senator has a lot of court cases that have not been completed, Mvurya said.He spoke when he launched a livestock and relief food distribution programme in Magombani. No party steals land. It is individuals who grab land and not a party, Mvurya said. He said residents know clearly about the ODM leader s land grabbing history in the area.Efforts to reach the senator were unsuccessful as his phone was switched off.Mvurya urged residents to support him and President Uhuru Kenyatta s reelection, saying the region must have a common, united political stand to avoid being divided by greedy leaders.
