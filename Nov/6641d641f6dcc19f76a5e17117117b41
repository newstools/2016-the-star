Consultative meeting featuring affiliates fails to startNational Olympic Committee of Kenya suffered a setback yesterday after a meeting chaired by Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (Anoca) president Lassana Palenfo ended in disarray following an invasion by placard wielding protestors.The protesters demanded the removal/resignation of the NOC hierarchy following recent corruption allegations levelled against the same and which are currently the subject of court proceedings.The Noc-k had called for a consultative meeting featuring their 21 affiliates to, among others, extend the discussions on the constitutional review process and electoral procedures as required by the International Olympic Committee.Palenfo was in the country on a fact finding mission as special envoy of the IOC in an effort to break the impasse between Noc-k, their affiliates and the government. He was also expected to meet Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Culture and Arts Hassan Wario.The Anoca president said as far as IOC were concerned they do not recognise the recent suspension slapped on Noc-k by the government and asked all stakeholders to allow the organisation to function without interference.He asked the stakeholders not to interfere with the Noc-k leadership by politicising the incidents in court and to allow the judicial process to take its course.Noc-k president Kipchoge Keino meanwhile accused and criticised the affiliates for allegedly hiring trouble makers The meeting was meant for Noc-k affiliates where each member federation was expected to send one representative each but I was surprised by the big number of none members who turned up, he said.Keino said this disoderly crowd was a big shame and embarrassment to Noc-k officials after disrupting an important meeting. It is also ashaming for that to be done before important visitors since it has painted the country in a bad light, he lamented.Keino said Kenya risked a ban for the unbecoming conduct as the action seemed to be undermining an office that has a legal basis.Meanwhile affiliates led by Noc -k interim committee secretary Andrew Mudibo said the meeting did not bring forth any fruits as they are still locked in a deadlock with the umbrella body.Mudibo said they will pursue the issue with IOC. He accused Noc-k officials of allegedely not representing the true picture of the situation. We shall be sending our representatives to dialogue with IOC at their headquarters in Lausanne to put the record clear, he said.
