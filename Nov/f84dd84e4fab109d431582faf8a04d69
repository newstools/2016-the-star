Siaya governor Cornel Rasanga has asked his colleagues to employ a strategy that will see them elect chairman of their council wisely.While backing his Bomet counterpart Isaac Ruto for re-election, he said that governors need a chairperson who can defend the interest of counties.Rasanga asked governors to consider a strong candidate, and should not gamble with the CoG chair position barely eight months to the 2017 poll.He told the press at his office on Thursday that he will lobby fellow governors to elect Ruto for another term at the helm of the council."We need someone like Ruto who can advocate for our welfare boldly before, during and after the elections," Rasanga said.He said that governors cannot rule out the point of victimisations following the growing interest on the top county seat at various counties.The governor further said that a new CoG chair should be derived from an individual who is politically influential as well as perceived fair."It must not be aligned in a way to favor any political divide the bidder belongs to," Rasanga said, adding that such considerations risk brewing favouritism and unfair leadership.He commended Ruto and Munya for exemplary leadership they have displayed during their tenure council of governor&rsquo;s office.Earlier, outgoing CoG chair Peter Munya had proposed Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma as his successor.Read: Munya fronts Ranguma to succeed him as Council of Governors chair Going by Rasanga's sentiments, it is unlikely that he will support Ranguma should the latter be nominated to the seat as endorsed by Munya.Munya will be leaving office as CoG chair at the end of 2016, paving way for elections of a new office holder.The incumbent CoG chair succeeded Ruto who had served for two terms as the CoG chair.If Governor Rasanga&rsquo;s proposal will be considered, Ruto will rise to the helm of the governor's agency for the third time as chairman.
