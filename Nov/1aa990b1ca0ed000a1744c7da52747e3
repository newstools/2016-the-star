Despite facing impeachment, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua spent the whole of last week in Kitui county to popularise his Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement and President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection bid.The governor held several meetings in Ikutha, Zombe, Miambani and Kitui town.He promised to deliver the Kamba vote to Uhuru, to spur development in Ukambani.Mutua said the region has been marginalised for decades.Selfish and unfocused leadership is to blame for the slow development in Ukambani, he added. "My party will support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto in 2017, but will field candidates in other positions," Mutua said. He said Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has done little to uplift the living standards of the Kamba, despite being in past administrations.Mutua said he will use Machakos county's enviable development practices to accelerate development in Kitui and Makueni counties, even with strong resistance from some leaders in the two counties."Time for politics that add no value to the lives of our people is long gone. I am willing and ready to lead the region to prosperity," he said.The governor said he is not interested in becoming the Ukambani political king, but he is driven by a desire to ensure residents have better lives.He said he wants to ensure women no longer trek many kilometres to get clean water."It is a pity that our forefathers were born in dust without water and even now our children are born in dust without water. And when development-conscious leaders come up with mitigation measures, they are branded betrayers," Mutua said.He said he will continue to work with the Jubilee administration so residents benefit from national government resources.
