The Kitui government has refuted last week s newspaper report claiming that the devolved unit was in a financial crunch and had delayed paying salaries three months.Head of communications Munyasya Musya circulated an email to journalists denying the Standard newspaper report that appeared on Tuesday, November 8. He termed the report wild, baseless, malicious and devoid of professionalism. The claims are not only wild, baseless, but malicious especially coming from a leading newspaper in Kenya which should steadfastly uphold professionalism and the cardinal principles of journalism truth, accuracy, fairness and objectivity, said Musya.He said that the Kitui government demanded a retraction of the article and subsequent publication of an unequivocal apology by the Standard Group. He said it was false for the newspaper to claim that Kitui had not paid salaries for three months running. In clearly false assertions, the report claims that a show down looms between the County Government of Kitui and its employees with a clearly sole intend of pitting the County Government employees against the employer through creation of unnecessary anxieties and projection of non-existent unrests, said Musya.
