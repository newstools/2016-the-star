Kamba elders from Masinga in Machakos county have threatened to use &ldquo;traditional methods&rdquo; &mdash; a curse &mdash; to find Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala&rsquo;s daughter. She allegedly was kidnapped last Wednesday.Led by Paul Musembi, the elders yesterday gave the kidnappers seven days to release her or face a curse when they conduct a traditional oath famously known as &lsquo;Kithitu&rsquo;.&ldquo;If they want peace, let them release Kiala&rsquo;s daughter without any demands because if they don&rsquo;t, we will teach them the lesson of their lifetime. This is totally unacceptable,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Those trying to intimidate Kiala to stop his Machakos governor bid will be in for a rude shock. You cannot ask someone to drop is bid by kidnapping his kid, that is a very inhumane way of doing things.&rdquo;The elders urged the police to help find Kiala&rsquo;s daughter.Kiala&rsquo;s daughter was reportedly abducted on Wednesday by people the deputy governor said demanded that he drop his bid for governor.The text sent to his wife on Friday read, &ldquo;We have your daughter alive. We will release her. But tell your husband if he runs for governor, it will not be the first attempt.&rdquo;Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Kiala said the police are still searching for his daughter.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been challenged to give evidence linking Governor Alfred Mutua to the alleged kidnapping.
