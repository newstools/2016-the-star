Narok Governor Samuel Tunai and his Kisii counterpart James Ongwae on Wednesday led border communities in promising to live in harmony.The two attended a peace meeting held at Olmelil. It was convened by Rift Valley regional coordinator Wanyama Musiambo and his Nyanza counterpart Wilson Njega.The governors said the perennial conflicts have led to the loss of lives and property.Tunai and Ongwae said members of the Maasai, Kipsigis and Kisii communities were put together by God as neighbours and they should not allow a few criminals to cause animosity among them. Narok county is the face of Kenya, where we have Maasai, Kipsigis, Kisii, Kuria, Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya communities living in harmony. We should not allow the conflict on our borders to affect peaceful coexistence, Tunai said.Ongwae said two years ago, he and Tunai resolved conflicts between the Maasai and Kisii communities in Lolgorian and Kiango. He said they were happy residents of the two areas have been living in peace since then. We should be talking of how to improve cross-border trade and other activities that are aimed at improving the well-being of our people, not coming to solve border conflicts. Our people have been living as neighbours and nobody should change that, Ongwae said.Kisii Senator Chris Obure said he led legislators from Kisii to visit Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery last week and ask him to ensure the conflict that started early this year is brought to an end. Nkaissery assured us that he would be sending Musiambo and Njega to solve the crisis, he said.MPs Johana Ng eno (Emurua Dikirr) and Elijah Moindi (Nyaribari Masaba) said they have set aside Sh10 million each from CDF to start a water project to benefits all the communities on the border.
