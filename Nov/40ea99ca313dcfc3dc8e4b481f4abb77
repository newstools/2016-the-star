After two failed attempts, persistent thieves have stolen Sh2.5 million coffee from Kiru-Kiruru coffee factory in Kiriaini town, Murang a county. They allegedly tied the hands of four guards and threw them in a fermentation tank. The coffee was to be packed yesterday for milling. Farmers who expected money in their accounts after days of hard work are now a frustrated lot. The factory is three kilometres from Mathioya deputy county commissioner s office. Its manager Jackson Kimaru said they learnt about the theft yesterday at 5am. He said the guards, who said the robbers unchained them after their mission, were arrested. Factory vice chairman Joseph Kariithi said in the first attempted theft, farmers recovered the coffee from the bushes. In the second attempt, a watchman crawled from under the drying beds and blew a whistle, sending the scared thieves in different directions. Kariithi said after the first two attempts, the management contracted armed police officers, but the factory could not sustain their pay.
