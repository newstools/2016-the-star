The death sentence should be abolished as it is cruel, inhumane and degrading, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has said. Chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori said, It represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity and its irrevocable nature could lead to great injustice if inflicted on innocent people. She spoke on Thursday during a workshop organised by the UN Human Rights Office and the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee to assess public attitude towards the death sentence and how to handle capital offenders. The workshop is aimed at helping Pomac get Kenyans views on the death penalty.In a ruling on September 15, judges Jessie Lesiit, Luka Kimaru and Stella Mutuku said, Death sentence is not a cruel, inhumane and degrading punishment. However, it just cannot be meted on any person convicted of a capital offence. Proponents of the death penalty say it preserves law and order, deters crime and costs less compared to life imprisonment. They argue that retribution honours the victim and helps console grieving families.
