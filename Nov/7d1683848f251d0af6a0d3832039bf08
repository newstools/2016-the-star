United Nations secretary general Ban Ki Moon has urged world leaders not to gamble with the fate of future generations in matters of climate change.Ban said at his last climate change meeting as the UN boss that the World stands to gain much by acting on the Paris Climate Change agreement.The UN boss, whose tenure will come to an end next month after a 10-year term, said at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties-COP hosted at Bab Ighli, Marrakech, Morocco that countries must put their word on the pact into actions."Countries have strongly supported the Paris Agreement because they realise their own national interest is best secured by pursuing the common good. Now we have to translate words into effective policies and actions," Ban said.He said that the pact remains critical owing to its role in protecting planet earth, safeguard the most vulnerable and drive shared prosperity."The UN will help countries implement this agreement and the quicker countries act, the more the gain," Ban said.He asked developed countries to honour their commitment to mobilise climate finance of $100 billion by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate vulnerability."I have spoken with nearly every world leader about climate change including US President-elect Donald Trump. I am optimistic he will revisit his campaign rhetoric on climate change. I believe the more they understand, they more decisively they will act," Ban said.He noted the need to get on a global emissions pathway that limits warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close to 1.5 as possible.Scientists have observed that more than 150 million people live on land that could be submerged or suffer chronic flooding within this century, possibly causing massive waves of migration and instability."The choices we make today and in the coming decades could lock in catastrophic climate impacts for thousands of years to come. I strongly urge all countries to increase the mitigation ambition of their national climate plans by 2018. I call for the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies to accelerate the transition to clean energy," he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta is among African leaders attending the meeting.Read: World met survey reports 2016 as hottest year on record
