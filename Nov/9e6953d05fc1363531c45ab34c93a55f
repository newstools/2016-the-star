Three police officers who had impounded an unroadworthy matatu on Wednesday crashed it into a lorry at Zambezi, Kikuyu constituency. One was seriously injured. The officers were conducting a crackdown on unroadworthy vehicles at Kiambaa on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, when they seized the MML Sacco matatu.Driver Benson Ngige said the officers ordered him and his passengers out and impounded the vehicle, saying it was defective. The officers then boarded the matatu and told me to meet them at Kikuyu police station. Within a few minutes, and even before I boarded another vehicle, they caused an accident about 1km from where they left us, he said.Area police boss Kiptoo Birgen confirmed the incident, saying the officers in the Toyota Nissan matatu rammed into a lorry as they headed towards Kikuyu.Who was behind the wheel? The two vehicles were heading in the same direction. It seems whoever was driving the matatu lost control and hit the lorry, he said.Speaking at the PCEA Kikuyu Hospital, where the officers were rushed, Birgen said chief inspector Rashid Koko, inspector Stephen Moibei and another officer, whom he did not name, were in the vehicle.Koko, who was seriously injured, was transferred to the Aga Khan Hospital. The police boss said the other officers are in a stable condition. Birgen declined to reveal who was driving the matatu. ... investigations will reveal [who was behind the wheel], he said.Passengers condemned the incident, saying the police were not supposed to drive a vehicle they impounded for being unroadworthy. Sacco secretary Samuel Kamau asked the government to take stern action against the officers.
