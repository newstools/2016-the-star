After a morale-crushing defeat at the hands of Papua New Guinea in May, Kenya s temperament will come under severe Test again when they face Hong Kong in the ICC World Cricket League fixture at Nairobi Gymkhana.It remains to be seen what Thomas Odoyo s boys can offer in the wake of painful experience against PNG that saw them drop to fifth place in the eight-team event.With eight matches to play, Kenya will be looking for nothing short of victory to boost their chances of getting back to the top class international cricket.Having failed to qualify for the 2015 World Cup and maintain their ODI status, Kenyans have found themselves in unfamiliar position in international cricket and now have to contend with the likes of Nepal, Hong Kong and PNG. The three were nowhere when Kenya national team was mixing and dinning with the Test nations in late 90 s and early 2000.And with six matches already played, the team is still battling to get its footing having won only two matches and drawn one.Hosting ICC fixtures for the first time in four years, has come with double pressure to the team although it will be good to see how they play in front of their starved cricket fans. The team will have to ensure they win all their remaining matches if they are to boost their chances of making it to the 2018 World Cup qualifiers to be held in Bangladesh next year.Their second hurdle will be ensure their recent poor record in international fixtures doesn t return to haunt them on home soil. The side, captained Rakep Patel, will have to work on the batting that has recently proved to be their main undoing. The skipper has raised concern over batting and he is asking players to take charge. I want players to step up, take responsibility and deliver on the day. We are all capable of doing it but this will only happen if we takeresponsibility and give our best in respective roles. The players must take the bull its horns, he said. In their last match against PNG, Kenya were on the verge of victory at 210 for 4 in pursuit for 250 but lost six wickets for 18 runs to succumb to their rivals by 21 runs.
