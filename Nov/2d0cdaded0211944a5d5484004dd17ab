The MP said he wanted to know the activist's source of funds, to allegedly overthrow the government, and why he quit media."Why are you funded by George Soros, the American mercenary, to overthrow the elected Kenyan government?" Kuria asked in the post."When you were a street urchin you were saved by then Nairobi PC Joseph Kaguthi and he handed you over to Waithaka Waihenya at Standard Newspapers. What did you do?"The legislator attacked Mwangi further, saying he was destitute until the violence that followed the 2007/7 post-election violence."You got a comeback selling photos of dead people to Western media. (With) the Sh6 million you were paid for photos of dead people you started PAWA 254 centre on State House Crescent, later funded by Michael Ranneberger and the US Embassy," he went on.Kuria said the government cannot be "all that bad" if Kaguthi rescued Mwangi "from glue and marijuana in the streets".Regarding the activist's walk-out, he said it was his right."I have no problem. But I had organised for you rehabilitation centre admission," he said.During the show, Kuria defended the government over the recent Sh5.3 billion scandal at 'Mafya House' scandal. He said he will resign as MP if it is established that the Health ministry misappropriated funds.Mwangi did not respond to calls and messages for comment on Kuria's post but he said on Wednesday that "I cannot discuss any matter with the likes of Kuria"."I cannot respond to lies by Moses Kuria. He is someone else dog," Mwangi told the Star on his way to Parliament police station where some of the protesters arrested earlier had been taken to.Read: Kenyan police beat anti-corruption protesters, fire tear gas
