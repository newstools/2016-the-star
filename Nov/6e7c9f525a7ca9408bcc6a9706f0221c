Officials who oversaw the construction of the building that collapsed in Kisii must be charged for failing to follow laid down procedures, NGO council has said.National chairman Stephen Cheboi on Monday blamed the lack of fidelity to building regulations which has seen several buildings collapse, killing and maiming scores.On Thursday last week, a building in Kisii town crumpled, leaving nine people dead, on what the council blames on a possibility of officials being compromised. Cheboi, who now wants action taken against those culpable, said the building could not have collapsed if procedures and regulations were rightly followed.The building that caved in had been condemned by the National Construction Authority last year.Cheboi said several innocent lives have been lost due to poor planning and supervision in the construction industry."We urge the government to take action against contractors who are not following the laid down procedures," he said.Cheboi said the National Construction Authority must ensure that the contractors adhere to regulations guiding the sector, to end further deaths."Bad contractors and others who don't follow building procedures are endangering the lives of Kenyans," he said.The disaster management unit said that rescue and recovery efforts in the Kisii building had reached 60 per cent by Sunday.Two more bodies were retrieved from the rubble on Saturday while nine people are still reported missing.
