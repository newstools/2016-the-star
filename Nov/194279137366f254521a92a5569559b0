The principal of Kiru secondary school who went missing last week was found dead at the weekend. The body of Solomon Mwangi was found dumped at Juja-Kiahuria dam near Weteithie in Thika. It had signs of strangling. Mwangi's body was moved to the City mortuary and has been positively identified by the family who have called for investigations into his death. Mwangi was reported missing on Sunday, November 6, after he left home for Kariani sub-county offices to collect KCSE materials. Neither did he arrive at the exam collection centre nor at the institution on the fateful day, prompting protests by principals from Murang’a county. The school heads among other leaders took to the streets on Wednesday, November 9 after the teacher disappeared. Murang'a county woman representative Sabina Chege was scheduled to petition the National Assembly over the matter. Education CS Fred Matiang'i, during an impromptu visit to the institution, directed the DCI to investigate the incident.
