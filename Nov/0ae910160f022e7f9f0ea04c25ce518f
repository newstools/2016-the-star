Kenya Bureau of Standards has announced a plan to inspect all products issued with a diamond mark of quality starting Thursday.The Bureau said in a notice that this is intended to streamline the management of exemption on goods under the PVoC programme.MD Charles Ongwae said all consignments exempted will be required to undergo inspection on arrival with effect from December 1, free of charge.Consignments issued with Ministerial Waivers from the Ministry of Trade and exempted products for the manufacturing industry, i.e. raw materials/machinery/ equipment spare parts, are among other goods that will be inspected.Ongwae said the bureau will thereafter process local Certificates of Conformity (CoCs) and upload the same onto the Single Window platform for reference by KRA to facilitate passing of customs entries."All the affected importers/ clearing agents are therefore expected to facilitate the completion of verification check-lists by KEBS officers at entry points after registration of the Customs entries for processing of local CoCs for the exempted items/consignments," he said in a statement. He said no pre verification requests to either KRA or KEBS will be required for inspection of these categories of imports to be carried out as is currently the case for goods arriving without certificates of conformity.Also read: KRA and Kebs spell out fresh rules for imports
