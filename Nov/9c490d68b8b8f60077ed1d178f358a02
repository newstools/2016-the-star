Electricity producer KenGen is set to break ground for its Olkaria V geothermal power project next month, adding 100 megawatts to the 1,632 MW national grid. Managing director Albert Mugo said yersterdaySh36.8 billion (JPY 40 billion) funded project was in its final stages of commissioning. We have already reached a point of awarding a tender and in the month of December we could very well be having the ground breaking ceremony, said Mugo when he took shareholders to a tour of its Ngong wind farm. This, he said, would increase KenGen's contribution to the national grid to 81.6 per cent. The projects funding was facilitated by the firm s decision to issue rights as part of its on-going capital restructuring programme. Once you have the equity then you can raise debt because we have a capital structure where we can borrow upto about 70 per cent, said Mugo. This allowed the firm to float up to 4.4 billion shares at Sh56 each raising the company s equity to Sh26.4 billion, a 92 per cent success rate as it anticipated to gain at least Sh28.8 billion. This success would have not been possible were it not for our shareholders participation in the rights issue, said Mugo. During the meeting the firm expressed its future expansion plans stating that the Ngong wind power project was set for an upgrade aimed at adding 5 more turbines, each generating 2MW adding 10 MW to the grid. The wind power project funded by the Belgian and Spain governments currently has a capacity of 25.5MW generated by the 30 installed turbines which create 850kw each. The power generation firm is also looking to venture into solar power, stating that they received a Sh101.86 million ($1 million) grant from the United States Trade and Development Agency for the feasibility study for solar power generation.
