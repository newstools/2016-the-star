 Just send me the bill for Sh64 billion. That s what Treasury CS Henry Rotich told Governor Evans Kidero on Wednesday, ending months of complaints about a deadbeat government that hasn t paid its bills for years. All you have to do is submit the bill to my office and we take it from there, the CS said.Some government houses, including Vigilance House, Harambee House and Parliament have not paid rates to City Hall for years.But there s bad news:The Commission on Revenue Allocation plans to end allocations to Nairobi county over five years. The county should not be still dependent on the exchequer like other counties, CRA chairman Micah Cheserem said.But Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said the county should not be discriminated against because it is the smallest in physical size. We serve people not land. Nairobi has unique challenges that should not be ignored. We house all the diplomatic missions in Kenya, the national government and 60 per cent of Kenya s economic installations and the regional hub, Mueke said.Cheserem was responding to Kidero, who had questioned the criteria used by CRA. Kidero said the formula is unfair and works to the county s disadvantage.
