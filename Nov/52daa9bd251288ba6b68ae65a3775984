&ldquo;Just send me the bill for Sh64 billion.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s what Treasury CS Henry Rotich told Governor Evans Kidero on Wednesday, ending months of complaints about a deadbeat government that hasn&rsquo;t paid its bills for years.&ldquo;All you have to do is submit the bill to my office and we take it from there,&rdquo; the CS said.Some government houses, including Vigilance House, Harambee House and Parliament have not paid rates to City Hall for years.But there&rsquo;s bad news:The Commission on Revenue Allocation plans to end allocations to Nairobi county over five years.&ldquo;The county should not be still dependent on the exchequer like other counties,&rdquo; CRA chairman Micah Cheserem said.But Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said the county should not be discriminated against because it is the smallest in physical size.&ldquo;We serve people not land. Nairobi has unique challenges that should not be ignored. We house all the diplomatic missions in Kenya, the national government and 60 per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s economic installations and the regional hub,&rdquo; Mueke said.Cheserem was responding to Kidero, who had questioned the criteria used by CRA. Kidero said the formula is unfair and works to the county&rsquo;s disadvantage.
