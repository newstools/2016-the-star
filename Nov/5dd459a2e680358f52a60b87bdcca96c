Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday expressed outrage after he visited the Kakamega law courts, found the staff gone and premises locked.The courts were closed as senior judicial officers were attending a training in Eldoret yesterday and today. As you are all aware, senior officers are attending training in Eldoret today and tomorrow. But there should have been a skeleton staff to attend to the people s needs at the court, he said.A duty officer must be at the station during working hours, Maraga said.The CJ was with Deputy Registrar of the Judicial Service Commission and JSC commissioner Aggrey Muchelule.He later paid a courtesy call on Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in his office.Maraga is touring courts in Western region. He has been making impromptu visits to the courts. On Thursday, he was in Bungoma where he opened a new court and made a surprise visit to the Mumias law courts.Maraga said the judiciary has protected and will continue to protect devolution because that is what the Constitution requires us to do .He said he had fruitful discussions with Oparanya about building more courts in the county.Oparanya said his government will provide land for construction of more law courts in Lugari, Likuyani and Navakholo subcounties.The county will also find suitable land for the establishment of a children s remand home, he said. The CJ has requested us to provide the land and we are ready to do it so that juveniles do not mix with hardcore criminals, the governor said.He urged the JSC to post a Lands and Environment judge to the Kakamega law courts.The bulk of cases in Kakamega concern land issues, Oparanya said.The last Land and Environment judge in Kakamega was transferred and has not been replaced for the last three years.
