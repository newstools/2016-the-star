Mwingi residents have appealed to the government to solve the current water shortage, which has seen many rely on contaminated water from River Tyaa.They fear for their lives, as the water could cause ailments because waste from Mwingi market is dumped in the river. The residents say despite the contamination, they still have to buy the water because it is the only option they have.The shortage has seen the cost of a 20-litre container rise from Sh5 to Sh50 in the past three weeks. Water vendors have taken advantage of the situation to reap big.Resident Julius Mwanzia said from August, there has never been a steady water supply. He termed it fortunate that schools have closed, as children would go to school without bathing. At a time like this, even the price of bottled water shoots. The 500-mililitre bottle, which normally goes for Sh20, now costs about Sh50, Mwanzia said. Vendors want the problem to continue so they can shamelessly continue selling at exorbitant prices. But Kiambere-Mwingi Water Supply Company MD Paul Kinumba said the shortage has existed for two days due to power outage.
