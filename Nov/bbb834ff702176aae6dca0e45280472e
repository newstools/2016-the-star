A Naivasha Stadium caretaker has sued Football Kenya Federation over unpaid salary.Elvis Mwangi, who was appointed the caretaker through a letter dated September 10, 2014, says the federation has stopped paying him. He alleges that his salary was Sh50,000. Mwangi in a sworn statement said the federation stopped paying him after 3 months. He says he reported the matter to labour office in Naivasha, who immediately wrote a letter to the FKF president but there has been no response to date. I am suffering as a result of FKF s malicious and unfair actions. I have a family to fend for and our situation is getting worse because I am not receiving any salary, reads part of the affidavit.He said he has not received any money since the beginning of this year and has resorted to court s intervention after the federation failed to respond.Through his advocate Wachira Wanjiru, Mwangi says the federation has failed to honour the letters and calls by the labour officer. She wants the Labour and Employment court to order FKF to pay her client Sh900,000 as a salary from January this year to the date of the application. Wanjiru said the county labour officer in Naivasha wrote three letters to FKF president Nick Mwendwa to pay the arrears immediately but he has failed to comply.But the federation in reply says it has never employed Mwangi. An affidavit sworn by the General Secretary/CEO Robert Muthomi, said the federation have never employed Mwangi as caretaker. Muthomi added that the letter of appointment owned by Mwangi is a fabrication by Mwangi and other person who intend to defraud the federation. He further said the federation is not ware of such proposed stadia and do not have any plans to put up a stadium in Naivasha.Justice Stephen Radido certified the matter as urgent and directed the case to be heard on November 23.
