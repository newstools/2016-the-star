Nairobi speaker Alex ole Magelo has filed an application to set aside court orders stopping the impeachment of Governor Evans Kidero. Under a certificate of urgency, he argues that Kidero misdirected the court in obtaining the orders barring the assembly from discharging its constitutional mandate.Magelo said Kidero misled the court that he summoned him to appear before the assembly, while all they did was to notify him of the motion against him. He said the assembly invited Kidero to respond to allegations against him. Through lawyer Samuel Karanja, Magelo said the orders granted were obtained by material misrepresentation, concealment and non-disclosure of material facts. Kidero misdirected the court that the alleged summons issued in contemplation of impeachment proceedings violated his right to a fair hearing, while in fact, the assembly, via the invitation letter dated October 5, gave the applicant an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him, he said. Magelo said Kidero misled the court into believing he had been summoned to appear before the assembly, while in fact no summons were issued.
