Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has warned that Kenyans are getting poorer as a result of Jubilee's bad borrowing habits.He told the Star on Tuesday it was worrying that foreign debt has accrued to more than Sh2.5 trillion since 2013 yet there is no development to show for it.Mudavadi also warned that rampant corruption will cripple the country's economic growth if not checked and addressed in good time.He said the vice is to blame for the starvation millions of Kenyans are facing, and other problems including the lack of school fees."I have always said Kenyans deserve better in this age. The country incurs debts to be paid by the poor yet there are no improved services. So what are you doing?" he asked.The politician said none of this will be tolerated if he elected president in the August 8, 2017 general election.Mudavadi plans to form a national super alliance with Cord leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula to defeat Jubilee next year."We will ensure things are done properly. Kenyans deserve accountability from their government, not deception," he said.Read: Mudavadi to chart path for super alliance during Machakos meetSpeaking separately, Suba MP John Mbadi said the situation will worsen following plans by the government to float a second Eurobond worth Sh60 billion."Before they came to power, the country's foreign debt stood at Sh1 trillion.
