The Kisumu county government stands to lose Sh22 million paid for car and mortgage loans for five sacked executives.The Auditor s General Financial statement report for 2014-15 states the county revoked the officers appointments.The report says at the time of revocation, the executives had car and mortgage loans worth Sh22 million. The executives are Rhoda Badha, Vincent K Odera, Barrack Otieno, Stephen Orot and Joseph Okal. Their balances range from Sh4 million to Sh 4.7 million.However, in February last year, Diamond Trust Bank, without written authority from the county government, liquidated all the loans for the sacked executives from the county s lien account, Auditor General Edward Ouko says.He said personal loans advanced to the former executives should not have been charged against public funds. Consequently, the propriety of the expenditure could not be confirmed and the county stands to lose Sh22 million paid to the sacked officers, the report said.The county may have also been making payments close to Sh2.3 million every month to ghost employees.Ouko says in January last year, the county paid all its employees through cheques, which were to be collected by the employees. But 25 did not turn up to pick the cheques, which remained uncollected by September last year. The county may have been making payments amounting to Sh2.3 million per month, being the gross salary to the employees who did not turn up to collect the cheques, he said.The auditor, however, could not quantify how much the county had lost in total due to missing information in personnel files.
