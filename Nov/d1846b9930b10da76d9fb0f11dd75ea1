A contingent of General Service Unit officers have been accused of assaulting and raping a bartender and a fruit vendor during a night operation at the Allsops bus terminus on the Thika Superhighway.The officers, accompanied by their regular police colleagues from the Baba Dogo police station, conducted a raid on businesses within the terminus. They allegedly assaulted business owners and their clients and destroyed property worth hundreds of thousands of shillings.However, Starehe police boss Alice Kimeli said officers conducted a routine operation and no complaints have been raised. It would be helpful if such victims reported the matter to the police or other relevant authorities because as it is, no such incident has been reported, she said.A witness said the bartender and a fruit vendor were repeatedly raped. It was around 9pm when, all of a sudden, there was a commotion within our business premises. We were clobbered by GSU officers and forced into waiting lorries, the man said. The man said the officers stole cash, broke into fridges to steal beers and sodas, and made away with flat screen TVs.Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome said he was unaware of the raid.A woman trader among those beaten said, We were going on with our normal business activities when the GSU officers, without notice, raided our businesses, attacking everyone in sight without giving any explanation. The officers arrived in three lorries, raiding one business after another.Displaying her injuries, one woman business owner said she was lucky not to have been raped.The Allsops bus terminus is located 100 meters from the GSU headquarters. An array of businesses ranging from bars, food and clothing stalls are found within the terminus.
