A lobby group has started an initiative to educate Kenyans to demand for accountability from their leaders.This comes in the wake of allegations of massive corruption in the national and county governments.The Space for All group said it will go to all the counties to inform Kenyans of the massive looting going on in government and encourage them to fight for their rights.Chairperson Anthony Maina on Monday said it is important that Kenyans fight for what is right by holding corrupt leaders accountable.He said MPs have engaged in massive misappropriation of the CDF cash, since they do not have an oversight agency to hold them to account.Maina said only a few projects have been implemented in the constituencies and MPs have &ldquo;falsified documents to hoodwink Kenyans&rdquo;. &ldquo;We have conducted a social audit in some constituencies and we have realised that what is presented in reports is not what is happening on the ground,&rdquo; he said.The activist cited constituencies in Murang&rsquo;a, where he said millions of shillings cannot be accounted for.He said Sh27 million in Kandara, Sh48 million in Gatanga, Sh9 million in Kigumo, Sh15 million in Kangema, Sh83 million in Kiharu, Sh9 million in Maragua and Sh11 million in Mathioya could not be accounted for in the financial year 2013-14.Maina did not, however, elaborate how they arrived at the figures, but said the lobby group has written to all the seven constituencies, demanding the money&rsquo;s whereabouts.He said the group will visit other counties to monitor the use of public funds and expose corrupt leaders.Maina accused the anti-corruption agency of failing to end graft and allowing a few individuals to pocket millions of shillings meant for development.&ldquo;We want to expose leaders who loot money meant to help Kenyans. This will enable people elect better leaders and demand answers when they are needed,&rdquo; he said.Maina said the group&rsquo;s objective is to enhance integrity, transparency and accountability among political leaders.&ldquo;We will organise protests all over the country to compel the national government to put better measures in place to eradicate corruption,&rdquo; he said.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is seeking answers on audit queries raised in the Health ministry. It is investigating claims there was double payment for goods and the alleged misappropriation of Sh5 billion, which cannot be accounted for.
