The Murang a assembly has disowned the land valuation document tabled before the Senate Public Accounts and Investments committee by Murang a Senator Kembi Gitura.They claim the document was forged, despite Lands and Physical Planning Committee chairman Duncan Njuguna saying it is valid and the valuation was done with the support of MCAs.Gitura said the county bought land at Sh10 million an acre, double the valuation cost of Sh5 million an acre.In a letter written by clerk Chris Kinyanjui and addressed to the county secretary Patrick Mukuria, the assembly has denied authorising a valuation for the 34 acres the county bought at Sh340 million. We confirm that the office of the clerk did not procure the services of a valuer for the said parcel of land, the letter states.The clerk, however, declined to comment on the issue, with some of the MCAs claiming he only found out about the valuation report last week.The clerk was responding to a letter from the county secretary demanding to know if the assembly had conducted the valuation through a private valuer. As you are aware, land is an emotive issue with the potential of causing lawlessness. This office requests your office to confirm whether the valuation report emanated from your office, Mukuria had said.Kembi tabled the document during a committee meeting that was questioning Governor Mwangi Wairia over alleged misappropriation of funds on October 27.The meeting was postponed after a heated exchange between Gitura and Wairia, where the governor said the senator is only seeking political mileage.Some MCAs led by majority leader Peter Kihungi later accused the senator of tabling a forged document before the committee and lying that it came from the assembly.However, the assembly s Lands Committee chairman Njuguna said he unofficially conducted the valuation with the support of the assembly on November 6 last year.He said 34 MCAs who voted for Wairia s impeachment last October agreed in a meeting to conduct the valuation to strengthen the sacking bid.The letter was meant to be presented in the Senate as Wairia s case was being heard, but it was concluded too late, Njuguna said.The valuation report seen by the Star indicated that the valuer, Morris Amollo Okoth, estimated the value of the land to be Sh194,400,000, with one acre valued at Sh5,562,232, he said. I am standing by this valuation report because I m the one who conducted it under the instructions of MCAs and I know it is valid, Njuguna said.He MCAs made personal contributions to have the valuation done, a sentiment sharply contrasted by Kihungi, who said majority of the 34 MCAs were not aware that a valuation had been done.
