The revival of Mumias Sugar Company has been turned into a campaign tool by the Jubilee administration, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said.He said the piecemeal disbursement of funds by the national government is meant to keep the problems at the company alive &ldquo;so they can be used every election time&rdquo; &ldquo;I told the President when he came here in June last year the Sh1 billion he brought was not enough, but I was told I was playing politics. I said the company requires at least Sh12 billion for revival, but I was ignored,&rdquo; Oparanya said on Friday. He spoke at Navakholo market when he inspected projects.He said MPs ganged up against a proposal by the county government that the state&rsquo;s 19 per cent shareholding in the company be surrendered to the county for better management, since agriculture is devolved.Oparanya said attempts by his government to support the company operations by creating a Sh200 million revolving fund were met with resistance; there were claims the money had been stolen.
