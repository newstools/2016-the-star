Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has asked Senator Moses Wetang ula to forget his presidential ambitions.He said Wetang ula s presidential ambitions are far-fetched, out of reach, can only happen in dreamland and that the senator should stop confusing Western residents.Lusaka spoke on Saturday at Mayuba Stadium in Sirisia constituency during a funds drive presided over by Deputy President William Ruto.The governor said Wetang ula should stop building castles in the air and wake up to the reality that he will never be Cord s flagbearer in the polls. We are politely asking our brother to cross over from the opposition and join Jubilee, which will make the next government because there is no future for him in Cord, he said.Lusaka said the Luhya community cannot go it alone in the polls. We once tried that middle path with Musalia Mudavadi s Amani and we failed. We would not like a repeat of that, he said.Lusaka said for long, Western residents have been in the cold for being in the opposition and fighting the government, which has hurt development. We are at the centre of Jubilee, which is going to form the next government, and we want our people to be part of it, he said.
