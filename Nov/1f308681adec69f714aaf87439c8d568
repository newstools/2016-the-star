Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has asked Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula to forget his presidential ambitions.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s presidential ambitions are far-fetched, out of reach, can only happen in dreamland and that the senator should stop confusing Western residents.Lusaka spoke on Saturday at Mayuba Stadium in Sirisia constituency during a funds drive presided over by Deputy President William Ruto.The governor said Wetang&rsquo;ula should stop building castles in the air and wake up to the reality that he will never be Cord&rsquo;s flagbearer in the polls. &ldquo;We are politely asking our brother to cross over from the opposition and join Jubilee, which will make the next government because there is no future for him in Cord,&rdquo; he said.Lusaka said the Luhya community cannot go it alone in the polls.&ldquo;We once tried that middle path with Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s Amani and we failed. We would not like a repeat of that,&rdquo; he said.Lusaka said for long, Western residents have been in the cold for being in the opposition and fighting the government, which has hurt development. &ldquo;We are at the centre of Jubilee, which is going to form the next government, and we want our people to be part of it,&rdquo; he said.
