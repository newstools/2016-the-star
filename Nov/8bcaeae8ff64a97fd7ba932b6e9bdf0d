"Nairobi County government will is keen to devolve fire and rescue services to the sub-county and Ward levels and we pray for your continued support," he said.Kidero said the deal includes 35 per cent in grant and 64 per cent free 20-year interest-free loan.Currently, the city has two fire stations based on Tom Mboya and Industrial Area, however only the former is fully functional despite the massive growth in population.The county s fire department has been ridiculed in the past for faulty equipment, arriving at fire scenes late, running out of water and having difficulties putting out fires in high-rise buildings.
