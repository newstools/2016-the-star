Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga (pictured) wants Homa Bay residents to elect him governor so he can transform it. Yesterday he said the county is likely to collapse if the current leadership is not changed in 2017. Magwanga said the Homa Bay government has failed to end graft, despite the advice given to Governor Cyprian Awiti by MPs. He said poor planning ruins the county.
