Rahul s four wicket haul not enough to save Kenya A Sixteen-year-old Rahul Seedhar produced a four-wicket haul but the performance hardly made a difference as Kenya A succumbed to their fifth straight loss in the Uganda Quadrangular series at Lugogo Oval.The Peponi School cricket captain produced a 4 for 65 spell of 10 overs to help Kenya bowl out Zimbabwe side Takashinga for 250 before another disappointing batting show steered Takashinga to a 95 runs win.Zimbabwe international spinner Tafadzwa Kamungozi s four wickets helped his side bowl out Kenya A for 155 with 19 balls to play.After winning the toss, Takashinga had a poor start losing three wickets inside 26 first balls before the middle and lower order steadied the ship to the over 200 mark with some crucial partnerships.Bundi and Martin Mworia had given Kenyan a good start with the wickets of Innocent Kaia (6), Foster Mutizwa (2) and Tymcen Maruma (0) to bring jitters to Takashinga s dressing room.Tinashe Kanhukamwe and Kunje added 46 for the fourth wicket before Seedhar dismissed Kanhukamwe for 46.Seedhar got his second immediately when he bowled Roy Kaia and then added both Westone and Wellington Masakdza on his wickets list after their side had recovered.Abraham Vadada was Kenya s top scorer with 30 off 45 balls before he fell to Kamungozi. Kavi Dosaja, who was second best with the bat for the Kenyan side with 24, was also a victim of Kamungozi s leg break.Others to fall to Kamungozi were Aveet Desai (13) and Seedhar (3).Opener Karan Patel was back in the pavilion after seven balls of the chase for a golden duck before Gandi followed five overs later with the board on 24.Desai and Vadada held up the inning for eight overs before Kamungozi dismissed Desai with Kenya A on 42.Seedhar was the next wicket to fall 15 balls later.Vadada stuck on for a while with a hope that he will anchor the innings and probably lead Kenya to their first win of the series but his 44 balls resistance that included a six and three boundaries was finally brought to an end when he was caught in the 24th over.Dosaja and Emmanuel Bundi tried to get Kenya closer after Vadada s dismissal but that lasted only six overs, yielding 15 runs before Dosaja was caught.Pushpak Kerai (12) and Adarsh Sawjani (15) tried to get Kenya A nearer the target but the Zims had done almost everything to win the match and they completed the win with 19 balls to play.
