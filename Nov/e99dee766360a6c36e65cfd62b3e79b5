State House Director of Digital Media Dennis Itumbi has urged Kenyans not to rush to pass a corruption verdict against the Jubilee government.He said people should wait for an audit and full investigations by relevant government agencies.Itumbi was reacting to queries raised over Sh5.2 billion at the Health ministry. I urge Kenyans not to hastily link anyone to corruption before investigations to confirm the same have concluded, he said.Itumbi said Kenyans will soon know the truth on the alleged theft of Sh5 billion at Afya House, saying the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and other agencies are investigating.He said it has become easier to detect graft after the government digitised its financial transactions through the Integrated Financial Management System. Itumbi, who was accompanied by other state officials, spoke at Our Lady of Consolata Cathedral in Nyeri town on Saturday, where attended the Inter-Diocesesary Music Council Festival. It included Nyeri, Nairobi, Muranga, Embu and Nyahururu dioceses.
