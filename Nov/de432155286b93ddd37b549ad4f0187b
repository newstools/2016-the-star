SPLM-IO asks Kenya to release Machar spokesman, condemn planned deportation from starwebmaster &quot;I am appealing to your esteemed office to abort the deportation case of James Gatdet and accord him with an asylum in a country he will be safe to reside,&quot; Kuon said in the letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon.They termed the incident unfortunate and one that should be highly condemned by all state leaders including Kenya, being a member of the United Nations.&quot;It is unfortunate that the Kenyan government wants to take this unwelcoming move of handing over an opposition spokesperson to a government that killed its own people,&quot; the letter said.Southern Sudanese Ambassador Mariano Deng dismissed the possibility of the arrest, creating a diplomatic tiff between the two countries.&quot;We are not going to get involved in the matter as it is between Kenya and the United Nations, not Southern Sudan,&quot; Deng told the Star on phone.He noted Kenya&#39;s relationship with his country will not be affected, and that the country must have a good reason for the arrest.Deng said he did not know the reason but separated it from any decisions by the UN.&quot;We are grateful to Kenya for efforts to restore peace in South Sudan,&quot; he added.This comes in the wake of Ban&#39;s&nbsp;sacking a Kenyan commander of UN peacekeeping forces in South Sudan.Johnson Ondieki was dismissed after&nbsp;a special report highlighted that the United Nations Mission in Southern Sudan (UNIMISS)&nbsp;failed in its role&nbsp;to protect civilians.The special investigation report released on Tuesday, stated that UNIMISS did not respond appropriately to the violence due to overall lack of leadership, preparedness and integration.The accusation was that UN peacekeepers abandoned their posts and failed to respond to pleas for help from aid workers under attack at Terrain Hotel.The hotel is a stone&#39;s throw away from the UN peacekeeping forces&#39; camp.The report further alleged that women were raped by soldiers from President Salva Kiir&#39;s Sudan People&#39;s Liberation Army (SPLA).Kenya has also said it is withdrawing its troops from the UN mission in South Sudan.&nbsp;The Foreign Affairs ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it was bummed by Ban&#39;s decision to dismiss Ondieki. In Ondieki&#39;s defense, the ministry said UNMISS suffered structural and systemic dysfunction, leading to its inability to discharge services and the UN&#39;s bias in judgment.Kenya has also said it will disengage from the South Sudan peace process.Read:&nbsp;Furious Kenya pulls troops from South SudanPolitical rivalry between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar sparked a civil war in 2013, when the president accused Machar of plotting a coup.Since then, thousands of people died in the conflict while others were left homeless before the rivals signed a peace agreement in 2015, aimed at ending 20 months of civil war.This peace deal came after Kiir faced threats of sanctions by the United Nations.
