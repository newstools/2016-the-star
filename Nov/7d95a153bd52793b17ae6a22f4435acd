Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto was on Monday airlifted to Nairobi after a police tear gas canister hit him in Bomet on Sunday. The Governor landed at Wilson&nbsp;airport at around 8.50am where he addressed the media before being taken to Nairobi Hospital for check up. He had a swollen face and a red eye. Rutto said police officers threw a teargas canister at him when he asked why some youths had been arrested. He was attending a church service at Njerian AGC, Silibwet Township ward when he received text messages of complaints from youths who were allegedly arrested. &quot;The youths claimed that some of them had been arrested by police on suspicion that they were his supporters,&quot; said&nbsp;Director of Communications Kiprotich Samoei. He said some boda boda riders went ahead to where Rutto was to raise the same complaint. &quot;Rutto was then forced to go to the station and ask the security in charge to release the arrested youths,&quot; Samoei said. &quot;An argument ensued between him and the police officers [as] a handful of his supporters joined him in asking the police to release the arrested youths.&quot; Samoei said an&nbsp;officer tried to hit him with a stick but the Governor&rsquo;s security thwarted the move. &quot;Around ten or more police officers retreated and lobbed tear gas canisters directly at the Governor in quick succession,&quot; he said. &nbsp; Samoei said Rutto sustained a cut that made him bleed. &quot;He was administered first aid on his way home where a doctor dressed the wound,&quot; he said.The Council of Governors said on Monday: &quot;Rutto to be airlifted for further medical attention.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;
