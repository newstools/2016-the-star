Kandara MP Alice Wahome has defended the Jubilee administration against allegations of massive corruption, saying only a few individuals loot public funds.She criticised the opposition for issuing a blanket condemnation for a series of scandals in government departments. Wahome said it is unfair to condemn thousands of other civil servants who serve diligently.She said President Uhuru Kenyatta has put measures in place to fight corruption. He even organises monthly departmental meetings at State House to streamline their operations.&ldquo;The President has shown goodwill and it is unfair for the opposition to accuse him of condoning the vice,&rdquo; Wahome said at St Charles Lwanga Catholic Church at Kenol on Sunday.She said, however, top government agencies charged with the responsibility of fighting graft are letting Kenyans down by failing to fast-track prosecution of suspects.The legislator said the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other prosecution departments have no excuse for not swiftly charging corruption suspects.&ldquo;These institutions are spending taxpayers&rsquo; money but not doing enough to safeguard public resources,&rdquo; she said.Wahome accused the opposition of being keen on portraying the Jubilee administration negatively by saying it extols corruption. She urged Kenyans to distinguish between the government and individuals suspected of being corrupt.&ldquo;The opposition lacks the moral ground to accuse the President of failing to fight graft. They have no agenda to facilitate anti-graft war,&rdquo; she said.
