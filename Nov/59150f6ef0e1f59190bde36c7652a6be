A lobby group in Mombasa has threatened to sue ODM following the recent expulsion of its errant members and Jubilee defectors.Umoja Summit Forum has said it will move to court to block plans for by-elections in the affected constituencies.Coast coordinator Anthony Chitavi said they will use all means to block the possible mini-polls should the registrar of political parties ratifies ODM's decision."Though this is unlikely, let them be aware that we shall challenge every single step towards by-elections," Chitavi said.He said that holding any election at the moment will be waste of resources and will also put IEBC under unnecessary pressure.The activist said ODM is employing 'divide and rule' tactic to in dealing with ODM rebels at the Coast region.Read: Ababu, Mvurya among 10 rebels expelled from ODM Chitavi said the move to expel Kwale governor Salim Mvurya, MPs Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale) and Masoud Mwahima (Likoni) while pardoning others was sinister.The party also expelled MPs Ababu Namwamba (Budalang'i), Stephen Kariuki (Mathare), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), and Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West).John Waluke (Sirisia), Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang'wara were also sent packing following a decision of the party's disciplinary committee.On Monday, ODM pardoned Marsabit Governor Ukur Yattani and Igembe Central MP Cyprian Kubai. The purge was on grounds that the leaders defied the party by working with Jubilee.Legislators Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), Chachu Ganya (North Horr) and James Rege (Karachuonyo) are expected to appear before the committee on Thursday. Gedion Mung aro (Kilifi), Mustaffa Idi (Kilifi South) and Khati Mwahsetani (Lunga Lunga) are also set to be probed on the same.Read: ODM rebels dare party to field leaders against them MPs Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache North) and Simon Ogari (Bomachoge Chache) rejoined ODM, weeks after decamping to Jubilee Party."As Coast people, we read an attempt to divide and rule us. Why is the party separating Mvurya, Chidzuga, Mwahima from Mung aro, Mustaffa Idi and Mwashetani?" Chitavi asked. He said Mvurya is one of the best performing governors and ODM's move to expel him was ill intended."All those who were punished had moved to Jubilee because they saw the good record of development attained by the government," he said.Chitavi said expelled leaders are victims of ODM brutality and that they should continue to serve electorate without being distracted.But ODM leader Raila Odinga has in most cases said that devolution should be credited for development in the counties, and not Jubilee.
