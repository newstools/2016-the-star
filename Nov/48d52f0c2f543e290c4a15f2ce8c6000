The National Cereals and Produce Board has denied claims it sold the Samburu government food unfit for human consumption.Addressing journalists at the Maralal NCPB stores yesterday, manager Newton Terer said the 8,000 bags of maize bought by the county for Sh11.2 million are safe and fit for human consumption. I want to assure Samburu residents and all Kenyans in general that the maize we have is actually good, he said.Terer said the NCPB has not received any official complaint from Samburu county. As we speak today, our client the Samburu government has not officially communicated to us on the status of the maize, so I am getting information from the media, he said.Addressing journalists after a meeting at the National Drought Management offices, Governor Moses Lenolkulal had said the NCPB sold the county contaminated maize.
