He will visit all six subcounties in Kitui. Mutua held a question and answer forum with residents and leaders of Ikutha ward and was hosted by Narc MCA Hussein Mwandia. He said, I have shared my personal story of growing up in a poor city slum. This story is no different from that of many children growing up in rural Kenya. I want to transform the county.
