Angry MPs sent back four senior health officials who turned up to represent the ministry at a parliamentary committee probe on the alleged Sh5 billion scam on Thursday.The legislators insisted they want to meet Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri, who were reportedly engaged at the EACC headquarters at that time.Mailu was said to have been under interrogation by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officials from 8am.And so was Muraguri, who was grilled on Wednesday, but had returned to EACC to present some documents at the time they were required in Parliament.The officials' meeting with MPs had been planned for 10am but was pushed to 2.30pm; the 24 MPs also said they had not read the interim audit report in question.The audit raised queries on how the ministry spent Sh3.1 billion in 2015-16 Financial Year. The legislators said that they were only relying on media reports, which indicated the loss of Sh5.3 billion.Medical Services director Jackson Kioko, head of vaccines Ephantus Maree, policy head Peter Kimuu, and Suleiman Abdi, an official in the department of administrative services, had represented the ministry."We are taking the matter very seriously. We wrote a letter to the committee on Wednesday asking for adjournment for us to meet at a later date," Kioko said.He said the MPs claimed they were busy and wanted to dispense the matter the same day.Kioko said the interim report and the ministry's response were available on the internet and promised to give MPs copies of the same.The ministry has defended itself saying it could clearly account for all the money in question.Health CS Cleopa Mailu said in a statement on Sunday: "The overview of our reply to the audit queries is that there was gross exaggeration of the figures involved; as well as application of inappropriate methodology."The CS questioned the process and quality of the audit and said the internal auditor had not identified any fraud or misappropriation of funds. He said if the auditor had shared the report with the ministry's management, as is standard practice, the ministry would have comprehensively addressed the issues.Read: Internal audit on Afya House 'a gross exaggeration of figures', CS Mailu says
