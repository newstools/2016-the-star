Kongowea MCA Jabez Oduor has accused Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho of invading his plot in Nyali.Oduor made the allegations after county inspectorate officials stormed the disputed parcel of land on Sunday to demolish a wall around it.Two county officials were arrested after getting into a scuffle with armed plainclothes police officers manning the plot. They were taken to Bamburi police station cells. Mombasa subcounty administrator Idris Abdulrahman resisted arrest prompting an officer to shoot He was then apprehended while other inspectorate officials left the premises. An entourage of heavily armed officers swarmed the property shortly after.Oduor said he had a court order restraining the county from invading the land and accused Joho of being behind his woes.He said this was the third time the wall was being pulled down since he acquired the parcel in 1996."The Governor said I will never build anything in this county as long as he is the boss. In fact today he posted on a certain WhatsApp group that he will pull down this wall as he did with that of KBC,&rdquo; the MCA claimed.More on this: Joho on the spot for pulling down KBC wallBut New Nyali Residents Association administrative assistant Galin Onyimbo said the land is public property.&nbsp;He accused the MCA of forging its title deed to obtain a court order. Joho and Oduor have been at loggerheads with Oduor accusing him of mismanaging the county.He &nbsp;distanced himself from the scuffle when the Star contacted him for comment. Through his aide Richard Chacha, Joho said Oduor encroached on the land.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a Joho-Jabez affair. The county is acting on public interest,&rdquo; Chacha said on phone.But he added that it was wrong for police to arrest Abdulrahman.&ldquo;Police should look at the law and release Abdulrahman unconditionally,&rdquo; he said.Kisauni OCPD Walter Abondo, who arrived at the scene later, said it was unfortunate that inspectorate officers had to engage with the police. &nbsp;
