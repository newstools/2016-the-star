The national and county governments and their agencies will now be required to give the public ample and meaningful time to make their contribution in decision making, a new Bill proposes.The Public Participation Bill, 2016, published last week by the Senate s Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee pegs the ample and reasonable time on the nature and importance of the legislation or the decision to be made.Public s participation will also be determined by the intensity of the impact of the legislation. The Bill is set to reverse poor public participation witnessed in the two levels of government. It says the responsible authority shall, before conducting public participation on a particular matter, identity the purpose and the level of participation required.The proposed law also says the government authority shall also be guided by the urgency of the matter,the number and circumstances of interested and affected parties and the ability of the targeted participants to access necessary information and the venue. The relevant institution shall give the public adequate notice to make their input on the issue, the propose law stipulates. The responsible authority shall ensure stakeholders have fair and equal access to public participation and the opportunity to influence the intended decision. The governments and their entities will be required to take necessary measures to allow participation of people living with disabilities. In areas and issues where the targeted participants are not conversant with the national languages, Kiswahili and English, the responsible authority will have to provide an interpreter for those who wish to make their comments in their local language.The Bill says at the end of each financial year, each authority carrying out public participation shall submit an annual report to the Senate and the National Assemble in case of the national government and it agencies, and the county assembly in case of the devolved units. The reports will capture description of activities and the outcomes of participation, complaints made and action taken.
