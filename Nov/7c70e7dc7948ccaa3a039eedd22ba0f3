The trial of an AP officer accused of the murder of his estranged wife and Kalenjin musician Diana Chemutai, stage name Chelele, will be held in Kisumu.Justice Jessie Lesiit yesterday directed the case, which has been transferred three times, be handled at the High Court in Kisumu.The musician and her husband were in 2012 charged before the High Court in Kericho with the murder of an Eldoret surveyor Eliud Yego, who allegedly had an affair with her. But on January 7 Chelele was found murdered, and her body dumped outside her house in Kapkwen, Bomet county.The state dropped charges against Chemutai while directing that officer Eric Musila remains in custody. State counsel Catherine Mwaniki said all witnesses come from Bureti and it would be economical to conduct the trial nearby. Musila has failed to take a plea twice as a mob attempted to lynch him while he was being escorted to prison. Musila s lawyer Wameyi Makomeri yesterday said he is uncomfortable with the case sittings being held in Nakuru, Naivasha or Eldoretfor security reasons. The case will be mentioned on December 16.
