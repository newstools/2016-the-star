Hayes Morrison is a brilliant but wild former First Daughter. When Hayes is caught in possession of cocaine, the district attorney blackmails her into serving as the head of the newly formed Conviction Integrity Unit. As it turns out, Hayes, the wild party girl, is a brilliant lawyer who graduated top of her class. The show follows Hayes and her team as they re-examine cases suspected of wrong conviction. The show has some engaging qualities about it but comes up short when integrating the stories of the cases and the life stories of the main characters. Star rating: 3/5
