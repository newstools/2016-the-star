A former nominated MP is at the centre of a 200-acre land dispute with a Nandi teachers sacco.Mark Too and Nandi Teachers Sacco both claim ownership of the land adjacent to the Eldoret International Airport.The two hold title deeds to the same farm.Sacco shareholders Zachariah Kuto, Christopher Biwott and Sammy Sawe said the organisation bought the land from the East African Tanning Extract Company between 1999 and 2001.The three said a tittle deed was issued in 2003 after payments were completed.The land, registered as Pioneer-Ngeria Block 1 (EATEC) 2917, was issued to the sacco by the Lands ministry branch in Eldoret.The shareholders alleged the original documents at the Lands office in Eldoret have been removed. Documents were removed from the file by Lands officials in Eldoret and new ones were put in 2014. We intend to take the matter to the highest court in the land, Kuto said. When we carried out an official search in 2012, the Nandi Teachers Sacco was still the owner. Now documents have been altered to show Mark Too as the legal owner. The Lands registry shows Too was issued a title deed on June 15, 2005.Too was the chairman of Lonrho East Africa, which owned 40,000 acres - including the disputed land - and sold it to private developers.The shareholders said Too has fenced off the land and blocked them from subdividing it among shareholders. This is a case of fraud and we appeal to the EACC to move in and help return the farm to the genuine owners, sacco treasurer Biwott said.Contacted yesterday, Too denied grabbing the land. The documents the sacco processed are fake, he said.
