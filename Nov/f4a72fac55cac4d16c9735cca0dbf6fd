Our aim is to protect the investor and make Kenya a much more attractive investment destination,&rdquo; said Capital Markets Authority chief executive Paul Muthaura.The Conference also highlighted the importance of behavior in influencing investment decisions where markets or individual securities could be distorted or rendered inefficient due to the influential biases of its participants.
