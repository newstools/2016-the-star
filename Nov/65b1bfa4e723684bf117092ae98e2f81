In a press briefing, Metito said the two wayward MCAs are associating with the opposition. We excused them from this meeting so Jubilee leaders can agree on what direction to take against their alleged association with the opposition, Metito said.Some 20 elected and one nominated MCAs, five MPs and a senator were present, butKajiado West MP Moses Sakuda was absent. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery was present. Metito said he was picked to represent the JP Rift Valley campaign team during the party s national governing council at Bomas. He said the meeting in Nairobi was to look into issues hurting JP s performance after it lost the Kajiado Central and the Mosiro ward by-elections to Cord. We want to instill discipline in the party and ensure all those around us are trustworthy, Metito said. Metito also said the meeting was called to discuss Kajiado JP matters and next year s campaigns.
