Kenya has lost Sh17.8 billion in cyber crime this year, a report shows.The report, launched in Nairobi yesterday by ICT CS Joseph Mucheru and Serianu CEO William Makatiani, shows the money has been lost from government and business-related websites.Makatiani said more than 42 per cent of organisations do not regularly train their staff on cyber crime, hence exposing themselves to security threats. Ninety-six per cent of organisations spend less than Sh50,000 annually or none at all on cyber security, he said, adding notable problems faced include budgetary constraints that undermine cyber protection. While there are high levels of investment in technology and automation, there s no matching investment in prevention tools. Mucheru said the government is committed to leading and supporting the development of comprehensive, defensive and offensive cyber capabilities to protect citizens. We recognise the need for expertise. The actualisation of the Computer and Cyber Crime Bill will see the ministry and key players conduct an aggressive nationwide education programme, the CS said.
