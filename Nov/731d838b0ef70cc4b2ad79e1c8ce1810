Africa has the potential of being a donor continent if it unites and exploits its vast natural resources, visiting Tanzanian President John Magufuli has said.Speaking during a state banquet hosted in his honour by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, Magufuli expressed the need for African countries to partner in development for the benefit of their citizens. Magufuli, who is the current chairman of the East African Community, assured Kenya of his support in accelerating the community's agenda and enhancing regional development. With EAC s population of 165 million people, the regional economic blocs of Comesa and SADC, with a combined population of more than 400 million people and other African economic blocs, including Ecowas, the continent is poised to become a donor community, he said. Magufuli underscored the need for the vast natural resources in the five EAC member states to be harnessed for economic development.Uhuru said the presence of a significant number of Kenyan investors in Tanzania is a clear testimony that the citizens of the two neighbouring countries are brothers and sisters.The President emphasized that EAC member states are not in competition with each other but complement one another for the mutual benefit of their citizens.
