US President Barack Obama s grandmother turned town an invitation to State House on Mashujaa Day saying she did not want to be deemed as having betrayed Luos.Nicholas Rajula, who is the Obama family spokesperson, said Mama Sarah Obama opted not to travel at the height of campaigns for 2017 polls.Rajula said someone identified only as Mathenge called from Nairobi asking him to plan for Obama's grandmother's trip.He said she was to meet Uhuru at the celebrations in Machakos before proceeding to State House. Efforts to get comment from State House were futile as the spokesman Manoah Esipisu did not pick calls or return text message.But Rajula said the trip was cancelled after extensive consultations, as the Obama family is out to protect its name."She said she could not make it especially now that Raila Odinga will be battling it out with(President) Uhuru (Kenyatta)," said the spokesman."She cancelled the trip for fear of being branded a mole," he further said, adding Mama Sarah turned down the invitation she received two months before "to save her reputation".He added that the family was not ready to support initiatives that will lead to accusations of betrayal of the Luo community.He noted that this cannot be the case "now that Raila is going to contest for the presidency for the last time".Mama Sarah noted the "unavoidable circumstances" she faced but appreciated President Uhuru Kenyatta's willingness to meet her.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa said in Siaya that Mama Sarah was expected at Machakos county as one of the heroines who were to be recognised.Read: Mama Sarah Obama to be feted on Mashujaa Day Wamalwa
