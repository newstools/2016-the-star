Top Kenyan athletes have congratulated the world 800m record holder David Rudisha for being appointed the African Athletics Confederation (AAC) athletes’ commission president. CAA president Ahmad Kalkaba Maboum appointed the two-time Olympic champion alongside former Nigerian sprints queen Mary Onyali (deputy president), Amandine Affoue Allou (Ivory Coast) and Algerian Hakim Toumi (members). Rudisha replaced former Namibian sprinter Frank Fredericks. Former world marathon record holder, Wilson Kipsang, said Rudisha has a lot of experience in athletics and deserves the position. “The appointment is a welcomed move for Kenyan athletes and the entire Africa. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Rudisha on his appointment,” said Kipsang said. He said Rudisha is conversant with the plight of athletes and will no doubt address them. Former world 800m champion, Eunice Sum, said CAA boss made a wise move since the ‘King’ has demonstrated leadership in different fields. “He is someone who listens and never lets any issue to pass without addressing it. I especially like his listening attitude and how he articulates issues,” Sum explained. Marathoner Elias Kiptum said Rudisha, after assuming office, should convene a forum with Kenyan athletes to get some of the issues they want addressed. The 2012 Africa junior 1,500m champion Hillary Maiyo also congratulated him, saying he harbors all the leadership qualities.
