Families started moving their loved ones from Embu hospitals on Friday, as a doctors strike entered its second day on Friday. They are taking the patients to private facilities and public hospitals in neighbouring counties.This is the second strike since July.The doctors are demanding promotions, pay arrears and they want more medics hired, as they are overworked.They issued a seven-day strike notice on November 4, demanding the county government implement a return-to-work formula signed after the July strike. The notice expired on Monday.Patients at the Embu Level 5 Hospital are the worst affected as they need specialised care. Anderson Kifathi said he was forced to move his granddaughter to Kerugoya Hospital because she is on oxygen.He said it is a sad day when doctors walk off the job, while they have patients in dire need of their help. I can t risk leaving her in this hospital anymore, said Kifathi with a catch in his voice.He urged that health services be reverted to the national government since the counties have failed. Patients lives are put at risk every time the counties fail to come up with solutions for medics problems, Kifathi said.Why does the county government bother to build more facilities and equipment when the services are so poor? he asked.Susan Njoki rushed her brother to hospital when he started complaining of pain only to be told the facility was not admitting patients.In July doctors went on a nine-day strike over a shortage of 93 medics. Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union secretary general Dr Ouma Oluga said they are being overworked.The Embu Level 5 Hospital, which caters to more than a million residents, has only five doctors, he said. This is below the required 24 doctors and it puts a strain on doctors.
