We are all concerned about its upsurge of graft allegations, but the problem lies with the relevant organs that have completely failed to ensure all those implicated are charged,&rdquo; she said.Laboso said the judiciary should speed up cases of corruption. She said the slow pace at which the cases are determined has caused anxiety among Kenyans.She also said she is ready to mend fences with her political rivals to ensure a smooth journey in bid to becoming the next Bomet governor.&ldquo;The journey ha started and I invite everyone to support me, not because I am a woman but because of my potential to lead the people and transform the county,&rdquo; Laboso saidShe said is aware there were many problems facing residents that can only be dealt with under her leadership.
