National Assembly Deputy Speaker and Sotik MP Joyce Laboso has been endorsed by her clan to run for Bomet governor.Laboso was blessed and endowed the powers of a community leader in a Kalenjin traditional ceremony.The ceremony was led by Charles Cheramgut and was attended by hundreds of residents.She was coronated by her Kipaeek clan elders on Thursday at her Manaret home in Sotik, Bomet county.After the ceremony, Laboso said institutions charged with fighting corruption have let down the Jubilee administration.She said the Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission and the anti fraud unit at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have failed to bring to book perpetrators of corruption in state agencies.Laboso said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto want to fight graft, but these agencies are failing them. As a matter of fact, no one in the country supports corruption of any form. We are all concerned about its upsurge of graft allegations, but the problem lies with the relevant organs that have completely failed to ensure all those implicated are charged, she said.Laboso said the judiciary should speed up cases of corruption. She said the slow pace at which the cases are determined has caused anxiety among Kenyans.She also said she is ready to mend fences with her political rivals to ensure a smooth journey in bid to becoming the next Bomet governor. The journey ha started and I invite everyone to support me, not because I am a woman but because of my potential to lead the people and transform the county, Laboso saidShe said is aware there were many problems facing residents that can only be dealt with under her leadership.
