Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi Wairia on Sunday dismissed his rival Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau&rsquo;s manifesto launch on Saturday.He told him instead to list the things he has done for residents during his 10 years as MP and when he was Nairobi Metropolitan minister.Kamau launched his manifesto despite the county dumping 100 tonnes of manure on the event site and the landing area for VIPs helicopters.Wairia said it was hypocritical for the MP to tell residents he will complete the projects his (Wairia&rsquo;s) administration has initiated. He said Kamau has nothing to show to farmers, saying that indicates he cannot be trust with leadership.Kamau said he will fight corruption, increase milk prices from Sh35 to Sh50, complete a milk plant being constructed by the county and establish milk ATMs in shopping centres. &ldquo;Why is he concentrating on things my government is completing? Why can&rsquo;t he tell us what he&rsquo;s doing to improve the sector?&rdquo; Wairia said in Ihura Stadium. There has been a war of words between the two in a lively campaign.
