CBS News' Lesley Stahl will interview Donald Trump for a piece set to be broadcast on "60 Minutes" Sunday at 7 p.m. The interview is Trump's first since winning Tuesday's presidential election. The interview will be conducted Friday at Trump's residence in Manhattan. Stahl will also speak with Trump's wife Melania, and his children Ivanka, Tiffany, Eric and Donald, Jr. Trump on Thursday met with President Obama at the White House for a conversation about the upcoming transition of power. In the final stages of his campaign, Trump had granted the bulk of his interviews to journalists with who he enjoyed a friendly rapport, such as Fox News' Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. Earlier in the campaign he had cionducted frequent interviews, more than many other candidates, with multiple media outlets, including CBS. By sitting down with Stahl for "60 Minutes," Trump is granting his first post-election interview to the broadest possible television-news platform. The long-running newsmagazine is television's most watched news show, and receives a sizeable lead-in during the fall from NFL football. Stahl spoke with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in July for "60 Minutes," their first interview together after the former named the latter as his running mate. She is currently in her 26th season with "60 Minutes," having joined the show as a correspondent in 1991.More to follow.
