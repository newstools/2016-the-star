Tiaty MP Asman Kamama is a "poor Pokot lad" whom retired president Daniel Moi helped to educate, West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo has said.Lonyangapuo added that Kamama would have been a "poor man in the village", and non-existent in politics had it not been for Moi."In fact he should be much grateful to the retired president and stop abusing the former Kanu regime saying it did nothing to uplift the economy of the Pokot community," he said.He noted that Kamama, who is National Assembly Security committee chairman, is a "living beneficiary" of the independence party.Kamama said last Saturday that his tenure has not been enough to transform the Pokot community, which he said was abandoned by Moi's Kanu regime.He said he inherited an underdeveloped constituency but praised the Jubilee and former President Mwai Kibaki's governments for allocating the CDF for roads, health facilities, schools and water projects.Read: Lonyangapuo has no ability to lead the Pokots, says KamamaBut the Senator told the Star by phone on Tuesday that Moi paid Kamama's high school fees alongside that of a group of needy children from the former East pokot district.Lonyangapuo said the former president further appointed Kamama to his government as a district officer, seeing the beginning of his journey to popularity.He said the MP was one of the many Jubilee leaders whose academic, social, economic and political excellence could "singly" be attributed to Moi. Some leaders like Kamama have forgotten where they came from and are talking ill of Mzee Moi and his Kanu regime. They could not have managed life without him," he said.The Senator said the Pokot community loves and praises Moi for the good work he has done for the people.Lonyangapuo said Kamama should therefore prepare to go home come the August 8, 2017 general election."We are going to replace him with a vibrant Kanu candidate of our choice who will take up the legacy of Mzee Moi, he said, adding Kanu is present not only in Rift Valley but also the whole of Kenya.The Senator urged residents to vote for Jubilee Party when he spoke during a women groups fundraiser at Chepkalacha in his constituency.Kamama will vie for post against Baringo speaker William Kamket (Kanu) and Jubilee Party aspirant Pepe Kitambaa.Kamket accused him of failing to implement more than 80 per cent projects in the constituency and blamed him for illiteracy, joblessness and poor health facilities. The fight for control of the community is between Jubilee and Kanu.Lnyangapuo and Tiaty clashed in October over who should be the people's spokesman.The tussle follows Lonyangapuo s (Kanu) installion as the spokesman on October 15. Kamama (Jubilee) said the Senator has no capacity and ability to lead the community.Read: Mine is a peace mission, says Lonyangapuo
