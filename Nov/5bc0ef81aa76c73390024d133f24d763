President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday launched the tarmacking of the Kamatira-Cheptongei Road in West Pokot county. He said the Jubilee government is focused on implementing projects to improves lives. Speaking at Chepkono shopping centre, he said his administration will spend more than Sh2.7 billion to tarmack the 84km road that will link West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. We are committed to transforming the lives of Kenyans wherever they are in this republic. That is why we are implementing all these projects, ranging from water, roads and health to education, agriculture, energy and security, Uhuru said. He criticised the the opposition , which he said is always trying to slow down government projects with misplaced accusations. Uhuru urged the opposition to adopt issue and policy-based competition, instead of concentrating on peddling falsehoods and propaganda. Kenyans are enlightened and will discern facts from propaganda. Some of the opposition members were ministers but they did little to improve roads in the country. In only three years, we have built many roads across the country, he said.Uhuru urged West Pokot residents not to be hoodwinked into voting for politicians out to use them to enrich themselves but care little about their welfare. Deputy President William Ruto said the momentum the Jubilee government has gained in implementing projects that have positive impact on the lives of Kenyans will not be derailed by the noise of people who do not have the interests of the country at heart. Ruto said Kenyans will not gamble but will vote for the Jubilee Party, which is uniting the whole country. Leaders, including Governor Simon Kachapin, said they will support the Jubilee administration.
