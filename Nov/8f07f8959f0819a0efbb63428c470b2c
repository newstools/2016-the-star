ODM rebels who were expelled owe Orange House Sh12.5 million in unpaid monthly contributions, a debt that impairs party operations.This has forced ODM to write to Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u seeking her intervention to compel the renegades to clear their arrears.They include Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya.&ldquo;A party cannot operate offices and keep the government on check without money to fund its activities, office operations and recruitment of members,&rdquo; ODM executive director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen said. &ldquo;We need this money like yesterday.&rdquo;The Orange House boss told the Star on the phone the rebels must be forced to pay the money because the party has served them diligently in their careers. &ldquo;The office of the Registrar of Political Parties said it will respond to us after receiving and going through the letter,&rdquo; he said.Mvurya owes sh1.5mMvurya owes the party Sh1.5 million, nominated MP Isaac Mwaura Sh560,000, Igembe Central MP Kubai Iringo Sh110,000 and Kilifi North&rsquo;s Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro Sh262,500.Others are Sirisia MP John Waluke (owing Sh610,000 ), Karachuonyo&rsquo;s James Rege (Sh410,000 ), Mathare&rsquo;s Steven Kariuki (Sh460,000 ) and Nakuru West lawmaker Samuel Arama (Sh330,000 ). The amount does not include annual subscription for elected officials, who are supposed to be life members of the party. &ldquo;Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba cleared his dues and is free to move on,&rdquo; Ong&rsquo;wen said.Other MPs who have not cleared their pending monthly subscriptions include Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga (Sh225,000 ) and Kitutu Chache South&rsquo;s Richard Onyonka (Sh600,000 ).The balance is owed by other ODM elected officials. Some only owe the party a month&rsquo;s arrears. &ldquo;We will move to the [Political Parties Dispute Resolution] Tribunal if they have failed to respond and the verdict might be harsh. We are happy with those who have started to pay,&rdquo; ODM chairperson John Mbadi said. He said on top of the Sh12 million, other legislators owe the party huge amounts of money.&ldquo;Those who were elected and want to seek reelection on the ODM ticket, must clear their dues immediately to be eligible for the nominations,&rdquo; Mbadi said.Early this week, ODM formally wrote to Ndung&rsquo;u on the expulsion of 10 rebel members. Ong&rsquo;wen further asked national and county assembly speakers copied in the letter to declare the rebels&rsquo; seats vacant.&ldquo;The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to have the members listed expelled from the party,&rdquo; the letter read. &ldquo;I request you to delist them from the register of ODM members.&rdquo; Ong&rsquo;wen said the party reached the resolutions after receiving a report from its National Disciplinary Committee.He said the National Executive Council adopted the report on October 30, a day before the rebels were expelled. ODM wants to trigger by-elections by having the rebels deregistered.Coast politicians defiantBut Coast politicians who have already moved to Jubilee have said they are not afraid of by-elections. Mung&rsquo;aro said he is ready for party disciplinary action.He said he will stand with those who have been expelled and wait for his lawyer&rsquo;s advice on whether to meet the ODM disciplinary committee.&ldquo;This has been a separation period. If there will be a divorce, the announcement will be made when the time comes,&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.Chidzuga dismissed her expulsion, saying the NEC, which endorsed the NGC decision, is in office illegally.
