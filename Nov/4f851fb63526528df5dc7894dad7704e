A section of North Rift youths have hit out at Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho over his continuous criticism of Deputy President William Ruto.The youths, led by Kerio Youths Association chairman Joel Kimaiyo, accused Joho of personalising his attacks on the DP.They took particular issue with his claim that Ruto was waiting for post-election violence to grab people s land, and said he is seeking cheap publicity to redeem his image. It is sad that the Governor can utter such outrageous statements to tarnish the image of the DP. This is nonsense... We are not going to allow this anymore, said Kimaiyo.The chairman told the Governor to apologise for calling Ruto a land grabber or face legal action. We want the Governor to tell us of the land he claims Ruto has grabbed. We are not taking this matter lightly, said the chairman. It is particularly wrong for someone of that caliber to call our DP a land grabber. He should apologise or we will take legal action against him."Read: Coast region will not vote for Uhuru, Ruto - JohoAlso read: ODM plans 'major declaration' at 10th anniversary rally in Mombasa, parallel to Jubilee'sThe group also responded to reports that Ruto referred to Joho as an academic dwarf with a questionable degree. Joho should know he is not in the same league as Ruto, as far as politics is concerned. Ruto is the Deputy President and Joho is a Governor in charge of a county. Period," said Kimaiyo.He said the Governor was bitter that Coast politics was changing in favour of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party.The people have realised the opposition has noting to offer them, he said, and asked Joho to keep off Ruto's affairs. Jubilee has initiated a lot of development projects in the region and addressed the land issue, while Cord is just engaging in mere politicking," noted the chairman.Also read; Ruto accuses Joho of buying academic papers, doing 'that' business
