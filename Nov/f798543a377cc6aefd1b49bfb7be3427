The government has set aside over Sh500 billion for ICT, energy and infrastructure-related ministries and state agencies to promote economic growth in 2016-17.In a speech yesterday, Infrastructure CS James Macharia said a robust and well-coordinated construction industry is critical in ensuring business competitiveness. From the Economic Survey Report for 2016, the construction industry posted 13.6 per cent growth, twice the national average economic growth. This again is an improvement from 13.1 per cent expansion, which we reported in 2015, he said.His speech was read on his behalf by Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano during the opening of the Annual Construction Research Conference and Exhibition at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.More than 200 local and international exhibitors are showcasing their products.Macharia said the sector created jobs for youth and has also absorbed locally manufactured construction products, such as cement, despite challenges.Recently buildings have been collapsing, killing and maiming many. Quality and safety concerns that continue to hinder optimum operationalisation of the construction sector can be addressed if regulators and government agencies align their strategic interventions, Macharia said.Proper site inspections must be done to safeguard investments and protect the sanctity of life, he said.The CS said there is a shortage of formally trained construction workers and urged contractors and artisans to continually improve their skills. This is important in view of the very worrying statistics where only 16 per cent of all construction workers are formally trained in technical areas relevant to their work, he said.National Construction Authority executive director Daniel Manduku said all proceedings will be published in reference journals and a hub for implementing the ideas will be put in place.Andy White, the senior vice president of dmg events Middle East, Asia and Africa, praised Kenya s construction sector for its rapid growth.
