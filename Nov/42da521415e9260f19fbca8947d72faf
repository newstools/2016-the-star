Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari has urged Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua to fold her party and join the Jubilee Party. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Gitari welcomed Karua s move to support President Uhuru Kenyatta in his reelection bid. Gitari said Karua should join JP and square it out with other aspirants eyeing the Kirinyaga governor seat since the President has assured JP nominations will be fair. The Kirinyaga Central MP is in the race for the governor seat alongside businessman Muriithi Kagai, who ran in the last elections but lost to the incumbent Joseph Ndathi. Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru is also in the race for the JP ticket. Two weeks ago, Karua said she would run for Kirinyaga governor on her party s ticket. Last week, while meeting delegates from four wards of Gichugu constituency at the Kianyaga Catholic Church Hall, Karua said she would support Uhuru for President.
