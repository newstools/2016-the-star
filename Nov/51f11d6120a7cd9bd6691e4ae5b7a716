The planned strike by 13,000 employees of the Nairobi government was yesterday called off after the county paid Sh1.2 billion salary arrears.The employees, under the umbrella of the Kenya County Government Workers Union, had on Tuesday threatened to go on strike from yesterday if their salaries were not paid.Union secretary general Boniface Waweru said the salaries were paid yesterday evening after a day-long meeting with county secretary Robert Ayisi. We agreed with the county secretary that on the fifth of every month, money should be in our accounts failing which we will not work from sixth, he said. Ayisi was unavailable for comment but sources told the Star on Tuesday that the salaries were delayed because of a system failure.
