His biggest rival Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro has alleged that more than Sh1 billion has been lost by the county government. But Kingi has denied these claims.At a press conference on Friday, Kingi said the county has never transacted any form of business with the said companies.He said they have been able to trace Sh8 million, which will soon be refunded to the county government.Three days after word on the scandal broke, Kingi suspended 10 county officials whose IFMIS passwords are said to have been used to steal the funds.
