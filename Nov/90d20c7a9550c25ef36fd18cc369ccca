The standoff between the Kenya Sevens Rugby team and KRU took another twist on Wednesday after players failed to show up for training.Their action was in protest over unpaid bonuses dating back to last season. The bonuses reportedly amount to Sh20 million.KRU chairman Richard Omwela revealed on Tuesday that a contract was signed, without the union s knowledge, by CEO Ronald Bukusi who is in the US for treatment.This latest development is a major setback for head coach Innocent Simiyu who is preparing to name his squad for Dubai and Cape Town Sevens on Thursday. Simiyu might be forced to name a weak team if the go-slow persists. It is also likely that he will name a different squad for Dubai Sevens to fill the void left by those protesting.A source close to the KRU said the union was not in a position to pay the amount and that negotiations were not taking place.The source further said Simiyu tried in vain to talk to the players on Tuesday, evidenced by their absence at the unveiling of new shirt sponsor Sports Pesa. The head coach tried to talk to the players and told them they stand to be the biggest losers if they don t tone down, but they didn t listen to him the source said.Read: SportPesa takes over from KQ as Kenya Sevens jersey sponsorSimiyu is reported to be assembling a new team to be named on Thursday as the union tries to reach out to the players.He said he was informed of the stalemate but would respect the players decision. Players are contracted individually. If they have made that decision I will respect it. I am only human... but fielding a team for Dubai will be very crucial for me, he saidIt s not the first time the union and the players have been at loggerheads over payments.Two seasons ago, former coach Paul Treu found himself in a similar situation as player s boycotted training over unpaid allowances, forcing him to name a relatively young squad for Dubai Sevens.
