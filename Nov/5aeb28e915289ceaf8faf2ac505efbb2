Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has asked opposition chief Raila Odinga to stop fighting projects he initiated when he was Prime Minister.Wamalwa accused Raila of fighting every water project that the Jubilee government implements, saying he designed and approved most of them aspart of vision 2030. It is unfortunate that the former PM is suffering from selective amnesia, fighting projects whose designs he paid for, he said.He spoke in Bungoma county on Saturday during an inspection of the Chesikaki water project.The Cabinet Secretary asked why the office of the PM, under Raila's leadership, paid Sh100 million for the design of the Sh38 billion Itare Dam project, yet he is now fighting it.The Cord leader termed the project in Mau Forest, Nakuru county, a Jubilee government secret and a environmental disaster likely to render several counties downstream, dry.Raila said the water project that was started in June 2015 is aimed at providing Nakuru township with water by drawing from several rivers originating from the forest. He was Prime Minister in the grand coalition government.He claimed during a press briefing at his Capitol Hill office in Nairobi on Friday that senior Jubilee leaders in Naivasha and Ruiru will benefit from the diversion of at least five rivers for personal projects.Read: Kipsigis elders challenge construction of Itare Dam in courtAlso read: Construction of Itare Dam continues to spark controversy in Nakuru, BometBut Wamalwa defended the work saying the dam will cater for more than 8,000 people in the county whose population he noted was ever-increasing.He said the project had been sponsored by the Italian government and that everything was done above board. It is fool hardy to call a project you initiated a secret project. If Raila was president he would still have implemented the Itare project," he said.He hinted that another project of the same magnitude will put begin at Pose dam in Nyandarau to ensure everyone has piped water in the next 14 years.The CS asked Raila to stop fighting the project for the sake of political gain as Kenyans lives are on the line.Sirisia MP John Waluke said anyone who has worked with Raila knows he will oppose everything to get donor attention.He asked the Jubilee government not to be intimated by noise and implement as many projects as possible.Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa also told off the Cord leader saying he was using cheap propaganda on development project to taint Jubilee's image. He should stop blaming President Uhuru Kenyatta as some of the projects were initiated when he was PM, and he approved them," Ragwa said during a fund raiser at Kiini Primary School on Saturday."He should give us alternatives such as planting trees to conserve the environment instead of faulting water projects that will help Kenyans."Ragwa further disputed claims that the project will dry rivers in Bomet, Nyamira and Kisumu counties.He underlined his support for Uhuru and asked him not to back down on the projects.On corruption claims the county boss said Raila should let relevant authorities probe officials implicated."Having an audit query is not a crime until it has proven one misappropriated the funds," he said.Also read: Uhuru taps my calls, Raila claims, asks Jubilee to stop Itare Dam project
