Milan Half Marathon and Susumua Dam Half Marathon winners Brigid Chepchirchir and Nicodemus Kipkurui braved Saturday morning's hot weather conditions to win the third edition of Kalya Half Marathon in West Pokot.Kipkurui, who comes from Elgeyo Marakwet, obliterated home favourites Reuben Limaa and Hosea Mwok, winning at 64:40 minutes.Limaa and Mwok gave home fans second and third podium slots in 64:57 and 65:24 respectively.Daniel Kipkosgei finished fourth in 65:35, while Silas Mwetich clocked 65:47 in fifth.Nicholas Korir closed the top six finishers in 65:51.The competition was sponsored by Kalya FM to sensitise the Pokot community to abandon cattle rustling.At the initial stages of the race, which started at Maili Saba in Trans Nzoia, it was not certain who would carry the day as the leading pack of 30 athletes commanded the onslaught.Kipkurui had the guts to break away at the 5km mark, increasing his pace for a wide gap before slowing down as he approached the boundary where his challengers Mwok and Limaa caught up.Surging forward as they were cheered by home fans lined up on the road, Limaa and Mwok were confident of striking it, but Kipkurui kept closing in on them.When the duo appeared to have run out of gas, Kipkurui engaged his strong gear at the 18km mark, overtaking them and dimming their hopes of shining at home.&ldquo;I broke away at the 5km mark but then I realised I was pacing highly and I could easily burn out. That is when I decided to slow down, but I was determined for the victory,&rdquo; said Kipkurui who also placed second at the Madoka Half Marathon in Kilifi.&ldquo;I am very delighted that I secured my second victory in my fourth appearance in the half marathon,&rdquo; the 2016 Laikipia 10km marathon winner added.He said he is preparing to run his maiden half marathon abroad.Nicodemus Kipkurui won the men's race in the Kalya half marathon, November 26, 2016. /STANLEY MAGUTIn the women&rsquo;s category, Chepchirchir locked 75:17 minutes in a tough battle to win first place.She was followed by Lucy Cheruiyot at 75:26 and Lydia Orango at 77:31.The top six was sealed by Margaret Agai who finished fourth in 78:32, Beatrice Ruto in fifth at 78:33 and Silvia Kibiego at 78:55.Chepchirchir, who won Ndakaini marathon, ran shoulder-to-shoulder Cheruiyot until the last 2 kilometres when she went forward.But Cheruiyot responded with a high pace, but Chepchirchir&rsquo;s power sprint saved her as she opened a 15-metre gap close to the finish line.&ldquo;I must admit that the competition was tough especially when I passed the hilly sections on the course.
