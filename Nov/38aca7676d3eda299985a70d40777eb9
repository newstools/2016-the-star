Fifty contractors and suppliers on Tuesday stormed the Nyeri county assembly, demanding Sh750 million owed them. They demanded MCAs pass the county s budget and clear the debt. They said they have worked for and supplied goods to the county government for three years without pay.The county assembly and the government are locked in a stalemate over the Sh6.4 billion budget for 2016-17. The government was allowed to spend half of the money budgeted after the Controller of Budget intervened.Contractors and suppliers representative James Ndegwa said their property has been auctioned by lenders. We came here because the explanation being offered by the county government for failure to honour payments is that the county has run out of funds, as the county assembly has failed, neglected and refused to pass the budget, he said.advised to sueNdegwa, who was accompanied by Zack Ireri among others, said the huge debt has stalled the Nyeri economy and activities.But Public Accounts Committee chairman Baragu Mutahi asked why they never demanded their money for three years, though the assembly has passed a budget every financial year. Whoever advised you to come here fooled you, which is a big shame because all the money you are demanding was paid during the previous budgets. We did our work and so the county government should clear all your bills. The only budget with a stalemate is this year s, he said. Deputy speaker Joel Gichuru advised the contractors and suppliers to sue the government.
