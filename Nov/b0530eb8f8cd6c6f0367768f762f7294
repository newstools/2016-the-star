Two Mombasa court officials have confirmed that Sh8 million went missing from the admiralty marshal account.Resident judge Anyara Emukhule and chief magistrate Teresia Matheka said they did not order the transfer of the money.The two said they were not aware of the lost cash since they were not at the station at the time the money went missing. Emukhule said the money was transfered during the tenure of different magistrates and judges.The Sh8 million was to be paid to 10 former crew members of MV Ponmudi. It was deposited at the account but was reported missing since June 10.This was after the ship which was transporting communication equipment to Somalia in 2010 developed mechanical problems midway and had to be towed back to Kenya.The crew moved to court in 2011, demanding to be paid their wages for the three months they were at sea.In July 2012, High Court judge Mary Kasango ordered that the ship be sold to pay the crew members. The ship was sold to Kraal Scrap Metal Enterprises in September 2012 for $US238,432 (about Sh21 million at the time).Justice Emukhule said they have written a letter to Commercial Bank of Africa requesting bank statements of the said account."We have requested our bankers to give us the statement of the period when the money went missing which will show how it was distributed," he said.Emukhule said they are conducting a probe to find out who the persons who signed for the release of the lost cash.A number of judicial officers including a judge and magistrate are already being investigated.Six litigants have further written to the EACC so that judicial officers who have already been transferred to be probed as well.Admiralty court deals with matters arising on the high seas, or in territorial waters, lakes or other navigable inland waterway in Kenya.
