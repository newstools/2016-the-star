ODM has written to National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi and Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u to declare rebel leaders&rsquo; seats vacant, party leader Raila Odinga said yesterday.They are Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba, MPs Stephen Kariuki (Mathare), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni), John Arama (Nakuru Town West) and John Waluke (Sirisia). Others are Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga and Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang&rsquo;wara. Raila said the leaders hold the offices because of the party and should seek reelection on the parties they defected to.&ldquo;We are justified to demand that the seats be given back to ODM,&rdquo; Raila said at Orange House, the party&rsquo;s head office.The party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee made recommendations for removal of the rebels as they no longer represent the party&rsquo;s interests in Parliament, he said. &ldquo;The ball is no longer in our court but the government&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Raila said. &ldquo;I set a precedent in 1992 when I left Ford Kenya and joined the NPK. A by-election was called and I was reelected because the people had faith in me.&rdquo;
