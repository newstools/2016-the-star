President Uhuru Kenyatta has congratulated the joint medical team which conducted a 23-hour surgery that successfully separated conjoined twins, aged two years. The team comprised medical professionals from the Kenyatta National Hospital and the University of Nairobi&rsquo;s School of Health Sciences. "The successful surgery by the multidisciplinary team is a continental first; and given the fact that it was conducted at the KNH Main Theatre is testimony of the vast improvement in the quality and capacity of healthcare facilities and services available in Kenya's public hospitals," Uhuru said on Thursday."We wish the twin girls a quick recovery and all the best as they embark on life after the surgery," the President said. The head of state also thanked the medical team for their outstanding work, dedication and a great sense of civic duty."The joy of the mother, relatives and family friends of the girls is shared by the whole nation and beyond," he said.Read: KNH doctors separate conjoined twins in 23-hour operation
