State House has accused the media of misrepresenting President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda for the country.In his weekly briefing on Sunday, spokesman Manoah Esipisu called for responsible reporting saying it is not a luxury to be undertaken at the whim of reporters."We have seen media coverage on a number of issues that reflected either a lack of understanding of the arguments at play, procedures, or the role of institutions involved," he said."These things are a critical ingredient of outstanding journalism. Stating opinion and half-baked stories as fact must be one temptation we would urge journalists to run away from."He did not specify the coverage he was referring to but Jubilee Party held the meeting of its National Governing Council at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Friday.During the meeting, Uhuru personally attacked Cord leader Raila Odinga, calling him "backward and petty."The President, who did not call Raila by name in his entire address at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi, said the opposition chief thrives on propaganda and lies.He took issue with Raila's claims on the Sh6.8 billion Northern Water Collector Tunnel project and allegations of a Sh5.3 billion scandal at the Health ministry.Read: Angry Uhuru turns Jubilee meet into Raila attack arenaBut Raila accused Uhuru of tapping his phone calls and took issue with his earlier description of him as "backward and petty".He also told Jubilee members that he knew Raila was going to hold a press conference about a dam project just to hunt for votes."I know Uhuru listens to my phone calls. He heard me talking to a friend about the project. That is why he was trying to pre-empt my statement," Raila said.Read: Uhuru taps my calls, Raila claims, asks Jubilee to stop Itare Dam projectEsipisu further said the report that Kenya Defence Forces are linked to illicit charcoal trade in Somalia was false.The Daily Nation reported KDF forces in Somalia receive fees for allowing illicit exports of charcoal from a port under their control.Quoting the United Nations, they said the troops get Sh202 per bag of charcoal loaded at the port of Kismayu.According to the report, up to six million bags of charcoal have been exported annually from Kismayu and Buur Gaabo, another port that is adjacent to a Kenyan base.But Esipisu said: "The media reports quote a UN report, which itself typically quotes faceless people and non-governmental organisations.""I want to take this early opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms possible this latest attempt to link the men and women in uniform defending our nation from aggression and evil forces."
