Twenty-six Machakos MCAs who on Wednesday unsuccessfully voted for the removal of Governor Alfred Mutua have termed the process a a big score.The motion flopped after 33 MCAs snubbed the debate, amidst reports that 32 of them were in Tanzania. The members who took part in the debate during the day were 27, but one opted out at the last minute by sneaking out of the assembly during the voting.The motion required 40 MCAs out of the 59.But speaking to journalists after the debate that lasted nine hours, the MCAs, led by mover of the motion Stephen Muthuka, said they had done the right thing.&ldquo;We are happy that we have done our bit, it&rsquo;s now for the public to decide if they want to reelect Mutua and give him another chance to continue messing up their lives, well and good,&rdquo; he said.Ikombe MCA Nathaniel Nganga said they have scored big in telling the people of Machakos who Mutua is for those who do not know him.&ldquo;That alone makes us grateful,&rdquo; he said.Nganga said they will not leave the matter at that level but will proceed to hand over the whole dossier of their motion to the EACC.
