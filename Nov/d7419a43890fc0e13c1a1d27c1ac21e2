Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday denied Pan Paper Mills in Webuye collapsed under the Grand Coalition government.Addressing the first Western region ODM delegates conference in Kakamega yesterday, he said President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected a proposal to revive the factory when he served as Finance minister.He said the Jubilee administration sold the mill at a throwaway price to the Rai Group of Companies. He said the factory was worth more than Sh10 billion. It was sold for Sh900 million.While presiding over Kibabii University graduation in Bungoma county on Thursday, Uhuru said Raila s criticism of his administration is not genuine. He said Raila failed to revive Pan Paper when he served as Prime Minister, yet he is criticising his efforts to revamp the factory. Raila said the sugar industry requires a lasting solution, not the piecemeal approach Jubilee engages in . He said Jubilee is desperate and is trying to tarnish his name by claiming that he was benefiting from county government cash.
