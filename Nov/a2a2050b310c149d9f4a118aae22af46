Ababu Namwamba has tabled a bill before the parliamentary Justice and Legal Affairs committee for the EACC to be disbanded for failing to deal with graft.The Budalang'i PM and Labour Party of Kenya leader said the commission has failed to deliver on its mandate and that there is therefore no need to continue wasting taxpayers' money."The commission is aimless and useless at the moment because there is no single case on corruption it has succeeded in taming," said Ababu.The law, he said, proposes its disbandment and replacement with a serious office crimes department like that in the United Kingdom.This will ensure corruption is addressed as a crime, he said in Eldoret on Sunday when he concluded his three-day tour of Uasin Gishu county, aimed at popularising his relaunched party.Read: Kenya needs to see a 'big fish' convicted of corruption - EACC bossWhile making reference to the National Youth Service and Health ministry scandals, Ababu said handling corruption should be the EACC's first priority but that this has not been the case."Instead of dealing with the corruption, the commission has gone to bed with those involved. As Labour Party we saw no need to have such a commission. We criticise constructively and offer solutions," he said."Once finalised by the committee, the bill will be tabled in Parliament and I with rally the support of the legislators, if they are serious about addressing corruption in our country."Ababu told former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru to take responsibility for the Sh1.6 billion NYS scam and stop passing the buck.He noted the service was under the Youth Affairs and Sports ministry in the grand coalition government but that Waiguru messed it up when she moved it to the Devolution ministry."The kind of smell and stench in that ministry is unbecoming. I handed over a clean NYS to Waiguru but she messed it up," he said. "She should be responsible instead of shifting blame to others."Read: Agitated Waiguru attacks Kabura, calls her puppet in Sh1.6b NYS fraudAlso read: Arrest Waiguru, all other NYS theft suspects, Ababu tells UhuruThe MP rallied for support in the county saying Labour Party will break the corruption chain.He said Philip Kipsoi Kiyeng and Chepchirchir Lagat for the senator and MCA seats respectively."Even if you vote for any party at the top, Labour will take ground seats and this will help break the chain of corruption," he said."It is a currently a tune sang from top to bottom and no leader will dare point out corruption in the government."
