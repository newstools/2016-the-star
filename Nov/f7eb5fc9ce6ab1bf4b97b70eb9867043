Five Kenyans out of six executives have been promoted by Ecobank Kenya to drive its business. The bank, which foresees the pan-African lender&rsquo;s operations in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, has appointed Kilonzo Zulu as the managing director for Ecobank Rwanda, while Raphael Onyango is the new head of corporate banking at Ecobank Tanzania. Others include Robert Kola (head of transaction services for the region), Alex Kabaara (regional head for internal control) and David Chebii, the regional head for early warning remedial and recovery. The appointments, Ecobank Kenya managing director Samuel Adjei said, will help the bank to become more efficient, and will streamline its operations in line with its strategy.
