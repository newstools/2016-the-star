Family Bank has issued a full-year profit warning after profit before tax for the period ended September 30 dropped by nearly half compared to the same period last year.Disclosures issued by the lender yesterday indicates pre-tax profit for the nine-month period declined by 46.6 per cent to Sh1.45 billion from Sh2.73 billion.This was caused by high operating costs which shot up 39.5 per cent to Sh9.18 billion from Sh6.58 billion, and increased interest expense on deposits to Sh3.30 billion from Sh2.03 billion.During the period, however, the lender's loan book grew 5.6 per cent to Sh55.8 billion from Sh 52.8 billion, resulting in a 36 per cent growth in interest income to 7.90 billion from 5.78 billion. We would like to bring to the attention of our investors that we will definitely make profit, but it will close at lower than 25 per cent of last year, managing director David Thuku said yesterday in a statement. We are determined to maintain a trajectory of sustainable profit growth. Therefore the transformation journey which we have started, which includes early retirement programme and other investments in ICT, had been factored in our budgets hence the anticipated slight dip in our 2016 profits. Family Bank is planning to layoff an unspecified number of employees with an aim of cutting high staff costs.Thuku affirmed the stability of the bank saying we are solid, strong and stable. Our liquidity ratios are way above the thresholds set by the Central Bank of Kenya, he said.
