Serbian Ambassador to KenyaIvan Zivkovic died aged 69 on Sunday evening, at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi, where he was &lrm;receiving treatment.Nairobi CID boss Ireri Kamwende said Zivkovic developed heart complications while at his Gigiri residence. His family said he had been suffering a heart-related disease.President Uhuru Kenyatta said Zivkovic's death was a big blow not only to his country but also to Kenya.Uhuru said on Monday that the Ambassador has been working tirelessly to improve bilateral and trade relations between the two countries since he was posted.He noted in a statement that Zivkovic's tenure saw bilateral relations accelerated, in the defense sector in particular, amid efforts for global peace and security.Uhuru further said Zivkovic strongly advocated for education, tremendously increasing the number of scholarships awarded to Kenyan youth by the Serbian government.He added that the Ambassador had been collaborating closely with regional states to build strong ties between the people of East Africa and Serbia.The embassy in Kenya is the only one serving Serbia in the EA region.&ldquo;It is unfortunate that we have lost a great and influential diplomat who was keen on strengthening relations between the people of Serbia and East African citizens,&rdquo; said the President.The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Serbia was formerly the political and cultural center of Yugoslavia. Today it is the northern remain of the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.In 2006, Montenegro voted after a referendum in favour of independence, to leave the State Union. In February 2008, after nearly two years of inconclusive negotiations, Kosovo, Serbia's southern province and a disputed territory, declared itself independent of Serbia - but Serbia refuses to recognise it. Serbia has an ambitious goal of joining the EU by 2020. In January 2014 Serbia opened formal negotiations with the EU for accession.
