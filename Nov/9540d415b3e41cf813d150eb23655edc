The row in Ford Kenya deepened yesterday as 40 branches snubbed party leader Moses Wetang ula and resolved to boycott his National Governing Council meeting at the Bomas of Kenya.Instead, officials from the 40 counties will attend a parallel NGC in Thika organised by a rebel wing that wants Wetang ula and all national officials removed for mismanaging the party. Both meetings are on Saturday.Rebels accuse Wetang ula of failing to call a major party meeting fore three years and for nominating himself as Cord flagbearer.National organising secretary Peter Munyae yesterday said 300 delegates out of 350 have confirmed they will be in Thika. We have finalised plans for the Thika meeting and it will proceed as planned so members can rescue Ford Kenya from possible collapse under Wetang ula, he said.Wetang ula s team was, however, busy organising for the Bomas meet yesterday. Deputy party leader Boni Khalwale said it will go on as planned. Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi said the rebel group, led by Trans Nzoia Senate aspirant Ken Wafula (pictured), is being used by rivals to cripple the party.Munyae yesterday said they have invited Wetang ula and all top officials to the Thika meeting, adding the Bomas meet will flop.
