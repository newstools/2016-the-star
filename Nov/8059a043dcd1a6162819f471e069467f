 Flower exports and local distribution were yesterday dealt a major blow after more than 400 workers from Kreative Roses went on strike. The employees of the Naivasha based farm are demanding a salary increment and an improvement in their working conditions. They vowed they will not resume duty until all their grievances are addressed. The strike comes months after Karuturi Flower Farm closed down sending home more than 2,500 workers, while the nearby Oserian flower farm laid off another 500 workers. The companies have cited harsh economic conditions which include high cost of labour and poor European Union market as some of the major challenges they are facing. The Kreative Farm workers accused the management of failing to remit their statutory deductions including the NSSF and NHIF for the last two years. Evelyn Oside, a worker, said employees have suffered under the current management. She said employees have had to pay for their medication when seeking treatment because the company had not remitted their NHIF money. “We have been kicked out and told that the farm has been closed down, and all we are demanding for is rightful dues,” she said. Oside said they earn Sh5,800 per month, adding the firm had refused to efffect a 25 per cent increase in salaries as agreed under their CBA. Another worker Justin Mose said the management had continued to oppress them by failing to provide transport and other allowances. Mose said the owner, a foreigner, says he has a huge debt which has made it impossible to increase employees’ salaries. “Our fate lies in the balance as we were kicked out of the farm by armed police officers. All that we are demanding is our years of services and other benefits,” he said.
