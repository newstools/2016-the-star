Nairobi County Assembly minority leader Abdi Guyo has said calls to dismiss the county secretary do not amount to an attack on the Luhya community.He said Robert Ayisi has been acting secretary for too long and he will mobilise MCAs to halt county operations if Governor Evans Kidero does not sack him. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Guyo said Ayisi has been using his powers to suppress and belittle ward reps.Earlier in the week, MCAs unanimously approved Guyo's motion resolving not to conduct county business with Ayisi or handle business form the executive until the secretary is fired.Read: Either Ayisi goes home or we halt business, MCAs tell Kidero"The law is very clear Mr Speaker; there is no way a person can be in an acting capacity for more than six months," Guyo told the assembly."The assembly shall consider any business transacted by the acting county secretary null and void and will pay no recognition or respect to any actions by the aforesaid in dispensing the suty of county secretary," he added.Kidero appointed Guyo in acting capacity in January.On Thursday, ODM Nairobi chairman George Aladwa warned Kidero against firing Ayisi saying it would amount to "political suicide"."If they remove Ayisi, it would not be business as usual. It will jeopardise our community voting come next year," he said.But Guyo said not all Luhya community members should carry Ayisi's burdens.More on this: Guyo's remarks about Ayisi are an attack on Luhya community, says Aladwa"Ayisi has a lot of audit queries when he was Health chief officer. Furthermore, he has reached his retirement age. We are after Ayisi, not all Luhyas ... they are a good community and no one should tarnish their good name," he said.He insisted that if Ayisi does not go they will not relent on their threats not to transact any business with the Kidero administration.
