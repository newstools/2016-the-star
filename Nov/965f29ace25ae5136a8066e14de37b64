She had to tell them what she was doing.&rdquo;Kaweesi said photography is not prohibited, but operations require procedures that Biira might have violated.&ldquo;I think she misbehaved. She might have accessed a cordoned-off area,&rdquo; he said.Kaweesi said Biirawas told not to go beyond a certain point but disobeyed, hence prompting the arrest.Kaweesi said he told the officers to grant her police bond, as &ldquo;the simple matter had been addressed.&rdquo; He said Biira would have to record statements.Kenyans on twitter reactThrough hashtag #FreeJoyDoreen, Kenyans on Twitter asked the Ugandan government to release the journalist, saying she was doing her work.The Uganda Law Society condemned the conflict, saying a commission of inquiry from both sides should be set up to investigate the cause.&ldquo;Both sides should cease fire and exercise maximum restraint to avoid further loss of life and property,&rdquo; chairman Francis Gimara said in a statement yesterday.The Society also demanded the officers release Biira and everybody involved in the abuse of human rights dealt with according to the law.
