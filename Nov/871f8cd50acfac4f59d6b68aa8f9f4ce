Kiambu county doubled its revenue collection to Sh2.47 billion, but had targeted Sh4.7 billion, Governor William Kabogo has said, clearing the air after reports emerged that the county had registered false figures.On Friday, research firm PesaCheck accused the governor of having given wrong figure of Sh4.7 billion as revenue collected as opposed to the actual Sh2.4 billion.In a statement, Kabogo said Sh4.7 billion was its target and not the actual collection.According to the annual county government implementation review reports between 2013 and 2016 the county collected Sh1.2 billion, Sh2.11 billon and Sh2.46 billion, respectively. This was double the national average set by the Controller of Budget, Kabogo said. Kiambu county revenue has doubled over the past two years and has recorded the highest revenue in Central Kenya. The governor said the back-end management system has helped the county to minimise wastage and increase efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection processes.The county has eliminated all forms of manual payment that led to massive losses of funds, he said. The county is in the process of issuing residents with visa-enabled county cards to be used for various payment platforms, especially by those paying for government services, as a move to completely shift to cashless payments to minimise fraud, Kabogo said.The governor said Kiambu forecasts a growth of Sh11 billion in the next five years, placing it in the global competition front.Kiambu county has also launched an electronic development application system that will enable pre-approval procedures for development applications. Physical planning proposals, architectural building proposals and designs will now be approved in a record 30 days to the maximum, Kabogo said.In 2015, Kiambu a new digital platform, powered by SAP East Africa, to enable a real-time reporting interface that can be accessed on a computer, iPad, tablet or mobile phone.
