More than 600 Jubilee aspirants in Nakuru county fear that nominations may not be free and fair after they were excluded from campaign activities in the county.They have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to involve them in key decisions within the party, including deciding the nomination fees and party activities prior to the primaries."Our ultimate goal is to make sure Uhuru defends his seat successfully in 2017," said Peter Ketyenya, who is vying for the Kuresoi South MP seat.More on this: Uhuru, Ruto face headache over party nominations"As aspirants, we do not want a situation where we are left out in making key decisions that will affect us.
