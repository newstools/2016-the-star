This was described as an intent to provoke a breach of the peace.The second charge was that on the same day he said, Release the prisoner or we set the police station on fire. The words indicated the police station was in danger of being set ablaze and destroyed, the court heard. Appearing before chief magistrate Lucy Mutai, Lempurkel denied the charges. The magistrate tried to calm the agitated legislator by greeting him and informing him he was their customer .Earlier, the prosecutor requested the MP not be released, saying his supporters were threatening the public.He also requested Lempurkel tell supporters to stop threatening police and the public, which would cause disorder.Lempurkel was released on Sh500,000 bond or Sh300,000 cash bail. The magistrate ruled that people make threats would be handled individually.The public and the MP s supporters were thoroughly screened by heavily armed AP oficers before they were admitted.The case will be mentioned on December 8 and heard on February 9 next year. In another case, Lempurkel was charged on Wednesday at the Milimani law courts, Nairobi, with assaulting nominated MP Sarah Lekorere in the office of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.
