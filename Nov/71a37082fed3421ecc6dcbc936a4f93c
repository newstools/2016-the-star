The question is does he know who stole the livestock?&rdquo; the delegation said.Lekorere and her delegation said they will not attend a meeting slated for Wednesday which they said will be turned into vilification of the leaders of Laikipia other than those defending the aggressors.&ldquo;We therefore has no intention to attend that meeting as we believe that nothing much will come out of it as the meeting is intended to sanitize criminal activity by a few,&rdquo; they said.Following the altercation, Lekorere recorded a statement with the police.Lempurkel refused to address journalists after recording his statement at the station. He also did not answer the Star's phone calls for comments.Lempurkel and Lekorere have been disagreeing over how to handle the invasion of Laikipia by Samburu pastoralists from the north.Lekorere supports the disarmament of the pastoralists, as ordered by the Cabinet in October.But Lempurkel says police are abusing the pastoralists' human rights and has been pushing Nkaissery to go slow on the disarmament.More on this: Don&rsquo;t stop seizure of illegal arms, we want peace, CS told
