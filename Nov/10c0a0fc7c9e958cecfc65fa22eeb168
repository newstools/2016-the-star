National Youth Service projects will end resource conflicts and banditry attacks in the North Rift by involving youth from warring communities, Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki has said.They will unite youths from warring communities and encourage peace, she said on Friday. The youths will construct security roads in areas hit by banditry attacks, Kariuki said on Friday.At least 900 youths have been recruited to build security roads along the border of Marakwet and Baringo East in banditry-prone Kerio Valley for six months. The 900 Marakwet and Pokot youths met for the first time since March, when attacks that claimed 17 lives broke out. These projects will only succeed if peace is sustained. I want you to be agents of change, Kariuki told the youth. You are now employees of the public service and your behaviour must change. She said 1,800 more youth will be recruited so that at least 2,700 are engaged in the Kerio Valley projects. Kariuki launched a similar programme in Mogotio, Baringo county.Marakwet East MP Kangongo Bowen said violence has disrupted development activities in Kerio Valley. Where we are today was a battle field a few weeks ago. I am certain this project will foster harmony between the two communities, he said.Bowen urged the two warring communities to start trading in open markets in Kolowa and Tot, as they traditionally did before March this year.Marakwet West MP William Kisang urged the youth to intermarry to enhance cohesion between the two communities.
