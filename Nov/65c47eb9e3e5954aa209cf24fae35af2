More than 100 Kenyan firms' representatives are part of the delegation on the two-day Turkey-Africa Economic and Business Forum which started yesterday in Istanbul. The companies are seeking partnerships with like-minded organisations in a bid to expand their businesses.In June this year, Kenya and Turkey formed a Joint Economic Commission to deepen their trade relations, with an aim of increasing the value of trade between the them from Sh14.4 billion to Sh100 billion annually.Turkey s exports to Kenya were estimated at Sh13.2 billion ($130 million) last year, key commodities being hygienic products, motor vehicle parts and tractors. Imports were valued at Sh1.02 billion largely comprised of coffee, crude animal products and vegetables. Turkey is an important market for Kenya with huge potential that has been under-utilised over the years. We expect to grow trade volumes tenfold from the current Sh14 billion in medium term, Industrialisation and Trade CS Adan Mohamed said.
