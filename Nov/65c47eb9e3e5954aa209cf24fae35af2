More than 100 Kenyan firms' representatives are part of the delegation on the two-day Turkey-Africa Economic and Business Forum which started yesterday in Istanbul. The companies are seeking partnerships with like-minded organisations in a bid to expand their businesses.In June this year, Kenya and Turkey formed a Joint Economic Commission to deepen their trade relations, with an aim of increasing the value of trade between the them from Sh14.4 billion to Sh100 billion annually.Turkey&rsquo;s exports to Kenya were estimated at Sh13.2 billion ($130 million) last year, key commodities being hygienic products, motor vehicle parts and tractors. Imports were valued at Sh1.02 billion largely comprised of coffee, crude animal products and vegetables.&ldquo;Turkey is an important market for Kenya with huge potential that has been under-utilised over the years. We expect to grow trade volumes tenfold from the current Sh14 billion in medium term,&rdquo; Industrialisation and Trade CS Adan Mohamed said.
