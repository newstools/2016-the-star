Democratic Hillary Clinton has called Republican Donald Trump to concede defeat.According to CNN reports, Clinton made the call on Tuesday night.Donald Trump sensationally won the White House race this morning as Pennsylvania fell at 1.36am humiliating his rival Hillary Clinton and the entire American political class with a victory which will send shockwaves around the world.The bizarre ending to Clinton s political career came after Trump confounded pollsters at every turn, capturing one 'swing' state after another in a line of toppled dominoes that stretched across three time zones and now ends at the White House.The last to fall was the Keystone State after Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Wisconsin all went to the Republican. That gave him 274 votes in the electoral college the winner is the first to achieve 270.He is also winning in the popular vote by a more than one per cent margin.
