More than 1,000 banditry attack victims in the Kerio Valley have demanded the government compensate them.They want compensation for the families of 20 people killed, 30 injured and for hundreds of livestock stolen. The residents said many people have been displaced and projects stalled.A list of their demands has been forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Human rights groups and the residents said cattle rustling has slowed economic growth, especially in agriculture and education. We have suffered serious losses that run into millions of shillings, yet as taxpayers, the government has the responsibility to protect our lives and property. It failed to do so and it s our constitutional right to seek compensation, spokesman Cosmas Mutai said yesterday.He said the Marakwet community in the Kerio Valley has not known peace for one month. Last week, women from Marakwet cried as they narrated their ordeal and its toll, especially on their children.MCAs, led by Festus Kirop, said the government has neglected Marakwet, leading to increased attacks on their common border with Pokot.Professionals, led by Livingstone Talel, protested in Eldoret town and said they will sue the state over the violence. As a community we have suffered irreparable damage. It s not possible to replace the lives we have lost, Talel saidHe said they want a response from the government, failing which they will seek legal redress. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has said it is investigating causes of the attacks and their effects to communities.Vice chairman George Morara said cattle rustling has been commercialised with far-reaching economic and social impacts. He said KNCHR will make public a report on its findings.
