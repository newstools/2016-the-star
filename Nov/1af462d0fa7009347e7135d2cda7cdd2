Two MCA aspirants and youth leaders have warned Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo against dragging Deputy President William Ruto into the constituency s dirty politics .They are Joe Mundia (Biashara), Samuel Gatheru (Gatong ora) and youth leaders Margaret Wanjiru and Peter Mwangi.Gathogo has accused Lamu Jubilee nominated MCA Muthoni Marubu of trying to introduce Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura to Ruto as he seeks to unseat her. In a recorded conversation between Gathogo and Marubu, the MP tells her to stop interfering with Ruiru politics.The leaders said Mwaura is a well-known legislator and doesn t need Marubu to take him to the DP. Mwaura is a real man and is capable of taking himself to the DP if the need arises. We demand that Gathogo apologise for dragging Ruto s name into her own wars with Mwaura. We respect her but she should say sorry, Mundia said. He said those talking of Ruto having a list of preferred candidates are his enemies out to make him unpopular so he loses in his 2022 presidential bid. Gathogo s arch-rival Simon King ara, who lost to her in the 2013 PNU nominations, is also in the race.Gatheru said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto have assured Kenyans Jubilee nominations will be free and fair. The issue of preferred candidates is neither here nor there. Candidates should brace themselves for the nominations, instead of developing cold feet and crying wolf, he said.Wanjiru urged the youth to maintain peace before, during and after the election. She said Kenya is not prepared for a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence that almost tore the country apart. Mwangi urged aspirants to play mature politics. He said Gathogo should stop politics of threats.
