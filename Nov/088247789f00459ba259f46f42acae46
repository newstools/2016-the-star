A lawyer in a land dispute in Karen, Nairobi, yesterday obtained temporary oders stopping his prosecution for alleged forgery and fraudulent transfer of the multi-million-shilling estate stopped.High Court judge George Odunga granted Guy Spencer Elms orders after he filed anticipatory bail, claiming his arrest and charge was meant to silence him from defending the estate of the late businessman Roger Bryan Robson from potential grabbers. Odunga ordered the case be heard on December 16.The DPP on November 2 directed the police to charge the lawyer, based on forensic findings that the purported signatures of the deceased on the will and the power of attorney meant to project Elms as an administrator of the vast estate are forgeries. &ldquo;He relied on these forged documents to obtain Grant of Probate of Will for the estate of Rodger Bryan Robson and in the circumstances you are directed to charge him with the offences,&rdquo; the DPP&rsquo;s letter to the police says.
