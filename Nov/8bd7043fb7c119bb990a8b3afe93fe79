I was not born in Makadara. I have no reason for going to Makadara,"he said.He categorically told the Star by phone on Wednesday that he will let members of the public know if he will vie for any elective post."I would do it in the open because I would like everyone to know... I would say it from the rooftops," he said. "The day I decide I vie I will let you know because I will want your votes."Mwangi, who is set to lead a demonstration against corruption on Thursday, said he had many interests."We all have aspirations and we are all allowed to dream. If I am dreaming about anything I will let you know," he said.Mwangi is known for leading heated demonstrations against societal injustice and severely criticising the Jubilee government led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.He has continued his offensive against Ruto on October 25, with a demand for the Deputy President's tax returns.In a letter to the Kenya Revenue Authority, his lawyer Gitobu Imanyara demanded Ruto s wealth declaration returns for the period he has been DP.More on this: Boniface Mwangi wants DP s tax returns, list of firmsRuto sued Mwangi for defamation over a tweet published on September 30 that linked him to controversial businessman Jacob Juma s death.He was sued for defamation but denied the allegation saying he will ably demonstrate the allegations he has made against Ruto.
