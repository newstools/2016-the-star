Busia woman representative Florence Mutua has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop speaking ill of Cord leader Raila Odinga for poking holes in the Jubilee government over corruption. As Kenyans we are worried about the direction the country is taking. Instead of promoting cohesion among citizens, the President is publicly calling Raila names. What does he think Cord followers feel when he attacks their leader? Even if Uhuru doesn t respect Raila, he should respect himself as the head of state, she said.Speaking during a graduation ceremony at Chawo Star Academy in Port Victoria town on Friday, Mutua said Uhuru should lead by example and unite Kenyans, instead of trying to divide them along ethnic lines.Mutua said Uhuru should not forget people are still talking about corruption, including the Sh3.2 billion possible fraud at the Health ministry and the NYS scandal. The rising foreign debt is a cause for worry. We fear our country might be auctioned if this trend continues, she said.Mutua said the National Treasury has failed to release Affirmative Action funds since March. What does the Jubilee government want us to do? She said corruption in awarding tenders is a serious concern because women are left out at the expense of the well-off. On Friday, Uhuru came out guns-blazing and branded Raila the lord of poverty , coming up with nonexistent issues to gain sympathy.Speaking during the Jubilee Party National Governing Council meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, he said Raila has mastered the art of coming up with wild claims about government failures.
