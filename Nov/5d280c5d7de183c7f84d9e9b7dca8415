One person was killed and eight injured on Sunday in renewed skirmishes between the Kisii and Kipsigis communities at Olmelil on the border of Narok and Kisii counties. One of the injured was KCSE exam candidate Thomas Singombe, 25, who was to sit the test at Ikorongo SDA Secondary School yesterday. The injured were treated at the Gucha Hospital in Keroka town and some were discharged. The victims were pursuing rustlers who had stolen three cows from the home of ODM parliamentary aspirant Ezekiel Oira. We were attacked by a large group of youths from the Kipsigis community as we followed the stolen cattle. They outnumbered us, forcing us to turn back under a hail of arrows, Singombe said. Nyaribari Masaba MP Elijah Moindi visited the wounded in hospital. I am calling on President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to immediately convene a peace meeting in this volatile area. Our people have suffered greatly since the skirmishes started early this year, he said.
