"The decision was an expedient political decision by the UN Chief to make the Kenyan soldier into a sacrificial lamb in order to appease and ward off undue pressures from some permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, mainly the United States of America and Britain, reads part of the report. It says the decision smacks of a brazenly shameful misuse of a respected global office to cover up American authorities failure to warn and protect its citizens in a war situation.The report claims American citizens in South Sudan were deliberately assaulted and some badly wounded during the Juba crisis between July 8-25, 2016 as a result of America s policy that sought to forcibly change the regime in Juba. Therefore, the removal of General Ondieki was a move to help a superpower cover-up for its negligence and failure to protect its citizens, the report said.Kenya protested General Ondieki s summarily dismissal by pulling out of the Sudan peace process through the withdrawal of its troops from UNIMISS.Read: Furious Kenya pulls troops from South SudanRead also: Uhuru sidelining Parliament in military decisions, says RailaThe IPG report says the UN should offer a formal apology to both Kenya and Lt.
