Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi has asked his rivals to consider quitting the race for him next year, saying he will not vie in 2022.Cheboi said he would like to complete the projects he started when he took office after the 2013 general election.&ldquo;I will not go for a third term so why not wait until I surrender the seat to you after my next term?&rdquo; he told his opponents on Saturday.&ldquo;It was just the other day that we were voted in as Jubilee leaders to implement devolved projects under the new constitution. We require a little more time to finish pending protects before paving way for other leaders to carry on."He spoke during a fundraiser at Kapkokwon Primary School, which required renovation following the receipt of digital learning devices from the government.Cheboi asked his critics not to spread propaganda concerning projects initiated under his administration.He has been accused of failing to implement healthcare, water, roads and ECDE projects but he said this was a lie and asked his opponents on facts, not hearsay.The Governor further underlined that he would be willing to hand his position over to whoever declares interest and is liked by the people.He will vie against Control and Licensing Board director Simon Chelugui and Knut Eldama-Ravine branch executive secretary Stanley Kiptis, who are also Jubilee members. Kiptis was a strong Kanu supporter but he crossed over to JP.The Governor also told his opponents to give him the respect they will want reciprocated for whoever wins the seat.But Kiptis dismissed him saying he was only effecting a game plan to blind-fold the people and win the election set for August 8.He said Cheboi will find another excuse in 2022 yet now is the time for change. The people are tired of being cheated out of their rights, he added.
