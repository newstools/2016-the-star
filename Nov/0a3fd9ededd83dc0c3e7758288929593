They say the hardest thing in the world is to love and be loved.I beg to differ.The hardest thing in the world is to keep up appearances in Nairobi. A week in the life of a typical middle class Nairobian would be great fodder for a National Geographic documentary. He will roll out of bed on Monday, groaning at the vast expanse of the week stretching out before him. An hour or so later, he will drive his gleaming machine into the endless Nairobi traffic, headed to a job he hates but goes to anyway because the money is great, and he has various loans he needs to pay off. He strides into the office, makes small talk with the co-worker he secretly loathes, then heads into his office to begin a long day of well-paid drudgery. At the end of the day, he will drive into his local, which isn t a ramshackle (because he lives in the right neighbourhood), but a nice little lounge nestled in the lush vegetation of a leafy suburb. After a couple of drinks with his boys, who have also spent their days in jobs they detest, he will head home to a sullen wife or girlfriend. Rinse and repeat all the way to Friday. His weekends are spent at social events. One of his friends is getting married, so he is forced to attend interminable meetings and traditional marriage-related ceremonies. Then he has to atone for his various offences of the week to his significant other, say, through a road trip to Naivasha and a couple of nights at an obscenely expensive resort. Sunday will be spent ruing the extravagance and resolving to be more fiscally responsible. That is until he logs onto his social media, sees his old schoolmate has procured a gleaming new European machine/moved into a leafier suburb than he has/flown business class to an exotic location, which inflames his desire to outdo him once more, and which will inevitably lead to a new loan application.Just another week in the middle class prison.
