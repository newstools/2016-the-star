French international midfielder Moussa Sissoko has attributed the slow start to his Tottenham Hotspur career on missing out on a full pre-season programme at the north London club.The 27-year-old, who impressed at the Euro 2016 tournament in his homeland, joined Spurs for a reported fee of 30 million pounds (Sh3.83bn) on the final day of the summer transfer window from second tier side Newcastle United.Sissoko, however, has yet to secure a starting role in manager Mauricio Pochettino&rsquo;s first team, making four of his nine appearances this season from the bench.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that there has been a lot of mishaps; my late signing, my lack of preparation for the season, my blow to the head against Middlesbrough,&rdquo; Sissoko told British media.&ldquo;When I arrived, I felt that my team mates were aware of the amount of my transfer. I was not just any player, but I ignore all of this.&ldquo;I was not at the top when I signed, but that&rsquo;s normal. They all worked well this summer while I had a mini-preparation. I had to work harder than others in training and some double sessions to keep up.&rdquo;Sissoko said he was not concerned by the strong competition for places at the club and vowed to prove his worth. &ldquo;All that now is behind me. I have come out, grown up. All the lights are green,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;Tottenham is the biggest club I have known. You must convince in every game, every training session. But competition never scared me.&rdquo;Fifth-placed Tottenham will hope to end their seven-game winless run in all competitions in a London derby against 17th-placed West Ham United in the Premier League on Nov. 19.
