"Claims that police are not yet there to beef up security is not true and even am very sure the media themselves could not arrive there due to insecurity,&rdquo; said Ngungu."We are still doing the investigation to find any issues of serious criminal acts".The County police boss said security authorities in Turkana were better placed to confirm the attacks at Lomelo and Lomuge villages in Turkana south.The ongoing attacks happen amid reports of over 5, 000 illegal guns unlawfully possessed by the resident in the pastoral communities in North rift region.Read: 2,000 illegal guns listed in North Rift counties
