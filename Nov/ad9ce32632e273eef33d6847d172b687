Baringo North MP William
Cheptumo has urged the National Government to deploy more security officers to patrol
the porous volatile borders of the county Cheptumo expressed concern over the ongoing Kerio
valley gunfire attacks between armed Marakwet and Pokots   along
saying the situation was threatening peace of his Baringo North residents. “My people have had sleepless nights for the last
six months as it forces  the youth armed
with poisoned arrows to engage in makeshift patrols along the border, because
there were no security offers to help them” Said Cheptumo. He was responding to a report carried by the Star
on Friday last week that some ‘some 500 Tugen youth armed with poisonous arrows
have launched security patrols along the porous border of Baringo North and Tiaty
sub-counties amid ongoing attacks between Marakwet and Pokots in Kerio Valley’. Addressing the media in
Kabarnet town on Saturday, the MP said his people were living in fear of the
pokot attacks especially towards December Christmas holidays, urging security
officers stay alert. “Although we have
stayed peacefully fr he last one year but we fear aggression of the banditry
attack along Kerio valley” He said listing the affected areas as Borsuswo,
Kalabata, Chepkesin, Marigut, Kapturo, Chemoe, Yatya, Ngaratuko and Kagir where
over 10 people were killed in 2014, several injured and over 20,000 displaced
by the banditry attack. He further stated that he had moved a motion in parliament
which has already been approved to have all victims of violence and banditry
compensated adequately by the government. "Everyone who has suffered either directly
or indirectly from intercommunity conflicts will be compensated by the national
government" he said adding that he is appealing to the national government
to implement that as soon as possible so that the victims of cattle rustling
will be reimbursed for the losses they have incurred. Additionally, urged politicians to stop
politicizing matters of insecurity, instead he said they have a mandate to preach
peaceful coexistence among the people. He said there have been ongoing peace caravans
around the county among the leaders seeking to strengthen peace among the
warring pastoral communities. The Kerio Valley region has experienced
instability for some time now, with more than 20 people losing their lives so
far. ENDS
