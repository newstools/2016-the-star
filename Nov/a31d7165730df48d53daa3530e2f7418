The Busia government has opened 1,465km of road since 2013, Public Works executive Bernard Yaite has said. He said this was made possible with the purchase of road maintenance equipment. Yaite spoke at his office on Tuesday. He said the county has a road network of 1,700km, out of which 152km are tarmacked. The others require regular maintenance and upgrade, especially their drainage systems.
