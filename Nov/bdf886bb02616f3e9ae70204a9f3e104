Facebook-owned chat service WhatsApp officially launched the video calling feature Tuesday for its over 1 billion users worldwide.It is now being rolled out to Android, iPhone, and Windows users. If you don't see the video calling option, or if WhatsApp video calling is not working, or if WhatsApp video calls are giving you an error, you could download the WhatsApp beta version APK to see if things fare any better. To use the new feature, WhatsApp users can hit the call button in the top right corner of a conversation, which will bring up an overlaid interstitial asking if you want to voice or video call. To kick off the video call, you simply select the video call option from this screen.During the call itself, you can switch between the forward-facing and rear camera, mute the call or press the red button to hang up. It seems the user interface varies slightly on Android and iPhone in terms of where the picture-in-picture video feed is displayed, as well as the buttons size, lineup and placement. WhatsApp already supports a number of standard features for communications apps, including group texting and voice calling. But the company says that video calling has remained one of its top feature requests from users.With video calling, WhatsApp is belatedly catching up with a number of rivals, for example, Skype, Apple s FaceTime, Viber, LINE and Google s recently launched Duo.
