Nairobi Jubilee aspirants have been assured of free and fair nominations that will be conducted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.The Nairobi branch Jubilee Campaign Secretariat has said only the commission's returning officer will be mandated with the role to offer the certificates to ensure the process is fair. We are determined to eliminate the slightest possible suspicion and we can only do this through making the whole process transparent. That s why we emphasise on the IEBC handling the whole process, including issuing of nomination certificates, head of the secretariat Maina Kamanda said on Thursday. He spoke to aspirants at Jubilee offices along Waiyaki Way. Kamanda assured the hopefuls that plans were underway to ensure the IEBC funds the nomination process. We do not want people to miss out on credible leaders because of money. The nominations will be funded by the IEBC, Kamanda said.He said this will ensure the team remains united even after the primaries.The team has said they want to distance themselves from the opposition's claims of any rigging in the next general elections by widening the vote difference.The party aims to secure 14 seats at the National Assembly in Nairobi and 65 seats at the county assembly in the next general elections.Nairobi governor aspirant Margaret Wanjiru said the party is determined to weed out all those who were uncertain about the party before the nominations.She said they will do this through the strict observation to the party's Code of Conduct. We don t only aim to deliver seats to the government but also maintain high standard of discipline in the party by following the Code of Conduct to the letter, Wanjiru said.She said they are drafting rules that must be followed during the campaignsto weed out problems that might arise.The secretariat said the grassroots campaigns have started to enabled them to secure 80 per cent of the opposition's strongholds.Some of the inappropriate conducts that the campaign team pointed out were supporters booing opponent candidates during rallies, taking of Jubilee banners to church, fighting of aspirants and talking ill of other candidates.
