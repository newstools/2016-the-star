The government has launched investigations into the activities of a foreign-owned company registered in Kenya but which operates in Somalia.The Department of Immigration Services has issued summons to the directors of Sahan Africa Ltd to explain its exact activities in Somalia.The department fears that the company is secretly involved in counter terrorism activities in the war torn country without the authorisation of the government security agencies.The government regulations require security related companies operating in Kenya to be approved through a stringent vetting process.Sahan Africa Ltd was not subjected to the process.The government is interested in Sahan after it detected anomalies in some of its official documents.In the Bank documents the company lists consultation in Agriculture as the nature of business it is carrying out in Somalia.The company s objectives as stated in the articles and memorandum of association make no mention of involvement in Agriculture. You are required to report to the Immigration office at Nyayo House without fail, the summon, dated September 19, reads in part.It is signed by the director of Immigration Services with instruction to Sahan directors to meet a Mr Maluta. Failure to respond to this summon is an offence contrary to section 53 (i) of the Kenya Citizenship and Immigration Act. The company is also accused of under declared the exact capacity of its staff, with claims that it has only recorded 13 when they run to over 100.It is the extra employees, a source reveals, who are paid through Dahabshil Money transfer service thereby bypassing the Kenyan domestic tax system.Yesterday, Emmanuel Deisser, a director at the company, refuted the claims. There is no truth in these allegations, he said even though he skirted most of the questions we posed.He explained the company is a think-tank dedicated to the promotion of peace, security and development through research, analysis and learning. Its primary area of focus is the Horn of Africa, where its core team possesses decades of experience in diverse fields.The fields include regional political and security dynamics, governance in transitional and post-conflict environments, conflict prevention, mitigation and resolution, political facilitation and peace building.The government wants the company to submit to the immigration documents that include passports, work permits, alien registration certificate of its expatriate staff and the articles and memorandum of association.It also wants the curriculum vitae, positions and certificates of all expatriates staff working for the company and of the 13 Kenyans reportedly working for the company.Sahan Africa Ltd was registered in Kenya on October 22, 2012 under the seal of P.K.
