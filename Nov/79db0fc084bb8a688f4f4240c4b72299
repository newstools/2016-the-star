Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has joined the growing list of politicians who want to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022.On Saturday, the Kanu chairman said he has been endorsed by the Kalenjin to run for the top seat. I have approached my supporters in the Nandi, Baringo and Kericho counties and they gave me the blessings to go for the seat after the President s term ends, he said.The son of former President Daniel arap Moi spoke at a fundraiser for former Kabarnet mayor John Kiprono at his home in Baringo Central on Saturday.

I was born in Kalenjin. My father and mother both are Tugen so and I don t see the likelihood of anyone blocking my dreams of becoming President, he said.On Monday last week, Ruto hosted a meeting of leaders from Baringo at his Nairobi office to discuss primarily Moi and his influence in Baringo, Pokot and other parts of the North Rift.The meeting resolved that the DP facilitate a retreat for Baringo leaders to strategise on how JP can win most of the seats in the county in 2017.Moi also has a strong support base in West Pokot, where Senator John Lonyangapuo of Kanu is expected to easily trounce Governor Simon Kachapin, who defected from Kanu to JP in July.The Baringo Senator has been unable to spread his influence beyond his home area, particularly to the populous South Rift.Critics accuse him of being more interested in business than politics and failing to revive Kanu, despite the advantage of his wealth and name.Back moi, he is stableKanu Rift Valley coordinator Jonathan Bii asked county leaders to stop divisive politics based on party affiliation and instead support Moi. What an awkward scenario to see Baringo leaders disowning their own yet we from other Kalenjin tribes are supporting him, or did someone curse you and die? he said.Kanu secretary general Nick Salat criticised Jubilee Party leaders, saying they have no stable agenda for Kenya.He said Senator Moi should not be worried because Kenyans will vote for him in 2022.
