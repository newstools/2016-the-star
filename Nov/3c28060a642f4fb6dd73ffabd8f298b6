Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has accused his rival Governor Mwangi Wairia of frustrating his plans to launch his manifesto in Murang a town by denying him a permit.The MP, who wants to run for governor, said he applied for a permit to hold his event at Ihura Stadium two weeks ago but the governor denied his application, despite there being no other booking for the venue.He said he was forced to apply to use Mumbi Grounds for his November 26 launch. Yesterday afternoon, the county government was pouring manure on the grounds.Kamau said he wants the county security team to ensure the governor and his supporters do not disrupt his event. I came to inform the commissioner that I have booked the ground for next Saturday and to ask him to offer me sufficient security, he said.Kamau spoke on Wednesday after visiting county commissioner John Elungata s office.The media was locked out of his meeting with Elungata, who did not address the press after the talk.Kamau said he will use the meeting to inform residents of what he intends to achieve if elected governor.He invited supporters and critics to attend the event to understand his development agenda for the county. I am especially inviting those who have been saying that they do not know what I plan to do as a governor, the legislator said. On that day, I will also talk about the dairy sector that is said to be the best performing sector in the county. He said he wants to make the county safe and ensure it is developed.Residents are only interested in projects that will improve their lives and do not want to be dragged into conflicts between leaders, Kamau said. I also want to urge the so-called goons who have been disrupting events to maintain peace so that we can all have peaceful campaigns, the lawmaker said.The governor could not, however, be reached for a comment.
