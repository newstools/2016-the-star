Kenya s Fifa referee Davies Omweno has been handed a three-month suspension after Libya successfully lodged a complaint with CAF following their loss to Tunisia on November 11.Omweno was suspended alongside his linesman, Eritrean Berhe O Michael. The Caf referees committee cited poor performance, wrong positioning and movement, incorrect identification of fouls and failure to administer some disciplinary sanctions as the reasons for Omweno s suspension.O Michael was also guilty of poor performance in identifying offside decisions including one that denied Libya a valid goal. O Michael fellow assistant Theogene Ndagijimana, who faced similar accusations, escaped with just a warning. Following the match, an African 2018 World Cup qualifier, where Tunisia won 1-0, Libya coach Jalal Damja blamed their loss to poor officiating .Sunderland s Wahbi Khazri scored a late penalty for Tunisia in a match played in Algeria due to security fears in Libya. I think it was the right decision, Ali Salama was the last man, Damja told BBC Sport. This is our reality, this is African football and we know officiating is a big question mark. Libya opened the scoring in the 10th minute through Anis Saltou but Omweno and his linesman consulted before the former whistled for offside.Referee s chief GMT Ottieno said it is always a difficult assignment for Kenyan referees in the Arab world , alleging there is warrant bribing of referees with those failing to bulge facing acrimony, especially from home teams. If Omweno is guilty of the said offences, then he only has himself to blame, said Ottieno. However, it is always good to understand that officiating in the Arab world is so tempting in terms of bribes and if one fails to accept them, life will never be the same, he claimed.
