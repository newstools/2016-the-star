Kenya&rsquo;s Fifa referee Davies Omweno has been handed a three-month suspension after Libya successfully lodged a complaint with CAF following their loss to Tunisia on November 11.Omweno was suspended alongside his linesman, Eritrean Berhe O&rsquo;Michael. The Caf referees committee cited poor performance, wrong positioning and movement, incorrect identification of fouls and failure to administer some disciplinary sanctions as the reasons for Omweno&rsquo;s suspension.O&rsquo;Michael was also guilty of poor performance in identifying offside decisions including one that denied Libya a valid goal. O&rsquo;Michael fellow assistant Theogene Ndagijimana, who faced similar accusations, escaped with just a warning. Following the match, an African 2018 World Cup qualifier, where Tunisia won 1-0, Libya coach Jalal Damja blamed their loss to &lsquo;poor officiating&rsquo;.Sunderland&rsquo;s Wahbi Khazri scored a late penalty for Tunisia in a match played in Algeria due to security fears in Libya. &ldquo;I think it was the right decision, Ali Salama was the last man,&rdquo; Damja told BBC Sport. &ldquo;This is our reality, this is African football and we know officiating is a big question mark.&rdquo;Libya opened the scoring in the 10th minute through Anis Saltou but Omweno and his linesman consulted before the former whistled for offside.Referee&rsquo;s chief GMT Ottieno said it is always a difficult assignment for Kenyan referees in the &lsquo;Arab world&rsquo;, alleging there is warrant bribing of referees with those failing to bulge facing acrimony, especially from home teams. &ldquo;If Omweno is guilty of the said offences, then he only has himself to blame,&rdquo; said Ottieno.&ldquo;However, it is always good to understand that officiating in the Arab world is so tempting in terms of bribes and if one fails to accept them, life will never be the same,&rdquo; he claimed.
