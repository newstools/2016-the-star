Zetech University chancellor Prof Susan Alfano has urged the government to set up a kitty to fund infrastructure for science programmes in private universities.Speaking during the university s sixth graduation ceremony on Friday, she said the kitty will transform private universities into leading global institutions and improve education standards.Alfano said science and technical courses are critical for Kenya to realise Vision 2030. She said this will be achieved through public-private partnerships. Student population in the country is rapidly growing and private universities will require multimillion-shilling investments for new buildings, laboratories, classrooms and equipment to accommodate the high number of students, Alfano said.She said the university will from next year set up an entrepreneurship incubation hub to help students sharpen their skills. We believe through the incubation hub we will build a group of young entrepreneurs who are using technology to run successful initiatives, Alfano said.
