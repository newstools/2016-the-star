The Maasai, Kipsigis, Kuria and Kisii should live in harmony and avoid tribal conflicts as they were made neighbours by God and nobody can change that , Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has said.He spoke on Tuesday at Oldonyo- Orok trading centre during a development tour.The communities live on the Narok, Kisii, Migori and Bomet county borders. For years, they have fought periodically, especially due to stock theft and boundary disputes.The governor said he is working with his counterparts James Ongwae (Kisii), Isaac Rutto (Bomet) and Okoth Obado (Migori) to solve issues that fuel the conflicts. I condemn the violence between the Kisii and Kipsigis communities and Maasai and Kipsigis communities in the recent past, which only serve to create unnecessary animosity, Tunai said.He urged residents to use legal channels and other dispute resolution procedures to solve land disputes and cattle rustling, instead of engaging in violence.
