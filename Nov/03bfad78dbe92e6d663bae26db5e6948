A former Nyeri MCA, who is among four county reps whose nominations by the defunct TNA party, wants the Supreme Court to extend time required for her to file a petition at the court.Naomi Wangeci, through lawyer Kibe Mungai, said the lower courts had not done justice to the case, therefore the matter should be heard at the apex court.Mungai, while making submissions before Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, judges Mohamed Ibrahim, Jacktone Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala and Njoki Ndungu, said the court should set the record straight by hearing the suit. "In view of the judgment by the Nyeri chief magistrate, the honourable court be pleased to extend the time for filing the notice of appeal and consequential petition of appeal against the judgement of the Court of Appeal," Muigai said on Friday.He said the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to strip Wangeci, Hanna Kabui, Ann Nyambura and Leah Mumbi their positions as members of Nyeri County Assembly."If the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to strip the applicants of their positions as MCAs, aren't they entitled to knock the doors of this court in search justice?" the counsel posed.Muigai said there are several issues for determination by the court as they are real grievances that have precipitated the suit and needed determination.In 2014, Chief Magistrate Wilbroda Juma faulted the nomination list in which Wangeci, Kabui, Nyambura and Mumbi were in.Juma noted that it was against the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s verdict delivered on November 8, 2013, and that IEBC "blindly" certified a faulty list."The court is satisfied that the petitioners have proved they lost in an inexistent contest. The field should have been free to all and that advertisement was highly crucial," Juma said. Juma stated that the party had failed to advertise the vacant positions as ordered by the appellate court.She pointed out that judges David Maraga - now the Chief Justice, Jamila Mohamed and John Mwera had asked TNA to ensure transparency in the nominations but the party failed to do so.The ruling will be delivered on notice.Read: Nyeri MCAs break into tears as court upholds their nomination
