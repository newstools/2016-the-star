The United Nations voiced concern on Friday for the safety of a top aide to South Sudanese former vice president Riek Machar after he was extradited to his homeland from Kenya, where he had been granted refugee status.South Sudan's 2015 peace accord unravelled three months ago when forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and to estranged ex-deputy Machar battled each other on the streets of Juba for several days.Machar subsequently fled South Sudan and has since been replaced as vice president although he has exhorted his supporters to reorganise for an armed struggle.His spokesman James Gatdet also fled the country, finding sanctuary in Kenya, but police collected him from his Nairobi home on Wednesday and put him on a flight to South Sudan's capital Juba the next day, officials said."He was deported from Nairobi by the Kenyan authorities and received by the South Sudanese government authorities," presidential spokesman, Ateny Wek told Radio Tamazuj, a South Sudanese radio station based abroad.Ateny could not be reached by Reuters for clarification of Gatdet's current status.A Kenyan government source confirmed the spokesman's extradition but did not explain the legal grounds for it.The UN refugee agency UNHCR said it was "deeply concerned about his well-being" and said his extradition appeared to violate his right to protection under the international refugee convention.UNHCR said it had unsuccessfully urged Kenyan authorities not to extradite Gatdet. Kenya has taken part in African Union mediation to end the South Sudanese conflict and President Uhuru Kenyatta recently visited Juba for talks with Kiir.Amnesty International called Gatdet's repatriation a "brazen and dangerous attack on refugee rights" and said he now faced a "grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment."South Sudan's opposition party had asked Kenya to release Gatdet before he was deported.Miyong Kuon, Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition representative to the UN, condemned the arrest in a letter on Wednesday.He termed it a violation of the United Nations charter on Freedom of expression and association, and added that Gatdet should be accorded asylum in a safe country.More on this: SPLM-IO asks Kenya to release Machar spokesman, condemns planned deportationMachar later condemned the deportation of his press secretary terming it a violation of the Geneva convention.He accused Deputy President William Ruto and Attorney General Githu Muigai of ignoring his appeal not to deport Gatdet for fears of his life.Read more: Machar rebukes Kenya for spokesman's deportation, calls for release
