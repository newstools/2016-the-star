Former Health PS Khadija Kassachoon yesterday was questioned by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives over her role in the alleged misappropriation of Sh5 billion.She was questioned for four hours. Some of the audit queries came up during Kassachoon&rsquo;s time in office, when she held Authority to Incur Expenditure. Her interrogation comes two weeks after Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri were questioned.Mailu confirmed that he had recorded a statement and submitted documents to the investigators. Muraguri was questioned for more than five hours and was asked about questionable expenditures, including unapproved budgets.He was asked to explain the audit queries raised in the interim report and the discrepancies on the amount paid to some suppliers and contractors. The EACC is investigating how Esaki Ltd, a company associated with its former chairman Philip Kinisu, was hurriedly awarded a tender to supply anti-malarial chemicals without proper documents. Investigators want to know how the firm got the contract yet it did not present a pesticide licence during the initial tender documents submission. The firm received Sh150 million on September 2015 for mosquito vector control chemicals.
