Donald Trump's campaign manager on Wednesday did not rule out the possibility of a special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton, saying she had not discussed it recently with the Republican president-elect but that the conversation would come "all in due time." Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence are "looking to unify the country, but we haven't discussed that in recent days, and I think that it's all in due time," campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC in an interview. Conway, also speaking on ABC, added that Trump did not discuss the issue with Clinton in his telephone conversation with his Democratic rival overnight.
