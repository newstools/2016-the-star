Kanu and Jubilee leaders on Thursday clashed in Tamugh, West Pokot county, during the fourth anniversary of Dini ya Roho Mafuta Pole ya Africa celebrations.Trouble started after Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen faulted "some parties" from the county for not joining the Jubilee Party.He said residents are not "cattle to be taken to the market for bargaining in order to be sold". We have changed politics and we should go where we can sit in a table and ask for government resources. Let s support Jubilee so that we can benefit from the national cake, Murkomen said. The Jubilee administration has changed Kenya and you cannot divide Marakwets and Pokots by saying Marakwets did not benefit from any government slots. Referring to Kanu, Murkomen said the party should either join Jubilee or Cord but not appear to be undecided.When he was called to speak, Senator John Lonyangapuo said Kanu is strong in the county and should not accept to cheated by other leaders from outside the county to join the Jubilee Party.He said elected leaders in the county deserves respect because they were picked by residents.Lonyangapuo is eyeing the governors seat.Civic Aviation Authority chairman Samuel Pogishio, who is running for the Senate seat, urged residents to support Kanu leaders at the county level, but vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta at the national level.He said the money some Jubilee leaders contributed in harambees should be lean money.Governor Simon Kachapin said Kenyans have freedom of movement and Murkomen has a right to attend functions in the county.Pokot South MP David Pkossing accused the Kanu team for bringing chaos in the church. The money the President contributes to the church is like an offering, he said. You cannot vomit on the plate you are eating from. Why do they go to Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and Kericho if they don t want other leaders to come here?" he asked.
