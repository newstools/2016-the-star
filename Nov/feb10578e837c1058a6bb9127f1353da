Album: DC4Artiste: Meek MillGenre: Hip hopRelease: October 28DC4, abbreviation of Dreamchasers 4, is Meek's fourth Dreamchasers project and one of his biggest since losing the rap beef with Drake. Essential tracks include On The Regular, Shine, Froze, The Difference, Blue Notes and Two Wrongs. The 14-track album includes guest appearances from Tory Lanez, Lil Uzi Vert, Nicki Minaj, Young Thug, Pusha T and French Montana. This project shows Meek is here to stay. He continues to exhibit great potential and it wouldn't surprise me if he fires back at Drake with a hit.Star Rating: 3.5 out of 5
