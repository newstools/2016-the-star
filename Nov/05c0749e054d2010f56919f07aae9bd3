Kenya might not take part in future peacekeeping missions after the UN humiliated its good intention in South Sudan, Foreign Affairs CS has pointed out.Speaking to the Star, Ambassador Amina termed the dismissal of Lt-Gen Johnson Ondieki as a humiliation of Kenya's willingness to advocate for peace in the continent. We are a sovereign state and we cannot be ridiculed by an organization, the country is really contemplating on its involvement in future peacekeeping missions, Amina said.Amina also pointed a series of faults that were committed during the dismissal of Lt-Gen Johnson Ondieki.She said that the state did not get any official communication explaining Ondieki's dismissal as the Commander of the UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan.Despite Kenya seeking to resolve the matter in a peaceful way, its efforts were futile as the United Nation failed to respond. The Kenyan Government tried to reach the offices of UN and they failed to respond, Amina said.More on this read: Ban Ki Moon sacks Kenyan Lt-General as head of UN mission in South SudanAmina went forth to critic the dismissal citing it as unfair and one that did not follow the laid down strategies.She faulted the decision to dismiss the general at the middle of an executive report yet there was no full report. The UN acted on an executive report, we expected as an international organization it would wait for the full report before giving a verdict, Amina said.She also dismissed the sacking saying that Ondieki had only served as head of the mission for 21 days before the violence erupted. General Ondieki started discharge of duty on 17th June while violence erupted on 8th July he had barely taken charge of the mission so I don't see why he is carrying the whole blame over the issue, the C.S said.Read: General Ondieki s dismissal from UNMISS an act of victimization, says reportThe country has dispatched over 30,000 troops in over 40 peace-keeping missions in the continent since 1974.In South Sudan, Kenya had deployed over 1,000 troops making it one of the mission s biggest supporters, according to AFP.Kenya's involvement in the program came under IGAD and was aimed at helping South Sudan get on its feet after a brutal civil war.Also read: Furious Kenya pulls troops from South Sudan Peace-keeping mission processThe decision to deploy peace support personnel for international and regional missions is solely made by the National Security Council (NSC).The NSC, then goes forth to advise the President of the Republic , who is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, on the same.After the President approves, (Section 18c of the Kenya Defence Act 2012), stipulates that the deployments seek approval of the National Assembly.The request for parliamentary approval will ordinarily be done through motions moved by the Majority Leaders or their designates in Parliament.The deployment of the officers to the missions is then done after fulfillment of rigorous peace operations training consisting of three months pre-deployment training of the personnel.Read: Uhuru erred to withdraw KDF - Raila
