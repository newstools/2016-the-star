Kenya has pull out its troops from South Sudan after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon dismissed Lt Gen Johson Ondieki who was in charge of the UN Mission.The government has further disengaged from the South Sudan Peace process and stopped plans to send more soldiers to the war-torn neighbour.A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed by PS Monica Juma (pictured) said the government had rejected the decision by Ki-Moon to dismiss Ondieki as well as the offer to nominate a replacement.Kenya argues it is clear that the continued deployment of its troops in South Sudan is no longer tenable, and is dangerous to their safety and well-being.The Ministry said the government is convinced the manner in which the UN and its independent special investigation dismissed Ondieki will not address the root causes of the South Sudanese conflict nor does it offer a sustainable solution. What is clear is that UNMMIS suffers from fundamental structural and systemic dysfunctionality, which has severely hindered its ability to discharge its mandate since its inception, the statement reads. Regretably, instead of addressing these shortcomings directly, the UN has instead opted to unfairly attribute them to a single individual, in the name of the Lt General Ondieki, the ministry said.
