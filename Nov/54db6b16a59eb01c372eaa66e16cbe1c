Residents of Slota slum in Mavoko subcounty have pledged to send home Governor Alfred Mutua in 2017.They said the government has neglected them yet they pay taxes. We have not seen any development implemented in Slota by the Machakos government since 2013, spokesman Joseph Omollo said on the phone on Saturday.Omollo said the residents lack water, the garbage lies uncollected and open raw sewerage passes near homes since the dissolution of the Mavoko Municipal Council. You can see the environment we live in. We are suffering. We were better off under the municipal council, he said.Omollo said women and children spend most of their time queuing at Mavoko Water and Sewerage Services water kiosks in the slum daily.
