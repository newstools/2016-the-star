The Youth Enterprise Fund has raised an alarm over a con game where fraudsters are duping youth seeking loans from the fund into sending them money.In a statement on Saturday, CEO Josiah Moriasi said the criminals, who are purporting to be representatives of the Fund, are coercing the youth through a fake Facebook page and website using pictures and other material copied from YEDF online channels as bait. They are duping unsuspecting youth into sending money and identification details to a certain telephone number, said Moriasi. We wish to inform the public that the Youth Enterprise Development is not giving any loans through Mpesa. The Fund does also not require anyone to send money to have their loans processed, he added.Read: Youth Fund seeks guarantors as number of defaulters growsThe CEO appealed to the public to verify such claims through their offices at sub-county headquarters countrywide.
