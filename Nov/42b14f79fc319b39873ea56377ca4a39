Wajir residents yesterday congregated at the Orahey open grounds in Wajir town to pray for rain to curb biting drought and water shortage.During the ceremony, traditionally referred to as Salatul Istisqa, they sought intercession from Allah. Religious and political leaders, led by Governor Ahmed Abdullahi, were present.Sheikh Mohamed Mohamud said when God withholds rain, it is a trial for everyone, whether Muslim, Christian, Hindu or Jew. Whether a woman, man, child, animal, bird or fish, drought devastates all living things and populations, he said.He deplored a Friday attack in which six people were killed and two seriously injured in Baqala at the Eldas-Wajir West border. Mohamud urged the warring parties to shun violence and seek dialogue to resolve cross-border conflicts so they can avoid loss of life.Abdullahi said his administration has increased emergency funding and spends Sh1 million per day to reduce suffering caused by drought. He said the county will continue providing basic necessities for victims and urged residents to pray so God can answer them.Abdullahi urged residents of Eldas and Wajir West subcounties to stop taking the law into their own hands, instead of pursuing peaceful ways to resolve their differences.
