South African President Jacob Zuma survived a no-confidence vote on Thursday, over what the opposition called his "reckless leadership", after the anti-graft watchdog called for an inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government."I think the no's have it," Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli ruled, after lawmakers of Zuma's African National Congress (ANC), which controls almost two-thirds of the assembly, voted against the motion and burst into song in support of Zuma.The main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for a re-count, a request which the deputy speaker granted.
