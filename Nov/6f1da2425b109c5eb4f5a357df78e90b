The bid by senators to get themselves Sh1 billion annually for oversight of the counties has been thwarted by the National Assembly.The House voted yesterday to adopt a report by the Committee on Delegated Legislation, which thrashed regulations drafted to provide a legal framework for the management of the Senate Monitoring Fund. The committee, chaired by William Cheptumo, in its report said the regulations as published violate laws governing expenditure of public funds. The panel said the decision was guided by law. Senators have been pushing for the allocation, saying they are not able to perform their constitutional roles because of inadequate funds. They were allocated Sh1 billion in the 2016-17 budget after the same attempt flopped last year. In the absence of the regulations, the senators will also be unable to access Sh300 million allocated to them in February for the last quarter of the last financial year.
