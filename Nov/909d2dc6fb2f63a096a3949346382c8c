The Maasai
Mara is undoubtedly one of the last frontiers for unadulterated
Wilderness experience in the country. For decades, the reserve has
served as a source of foreign exchange for the country, attracting
approximately 500,000 tourists every year. There
is something about the Mara that continues to attract hundreds of
thousands of tourists every year; it’s all about the wildlife, the
people, the culture and the safari experience. This is why it is
Imperative that this great reserve is protected and sustained to play
its vital role in the greater Mara Ecosystem. The
Mara’s global allure attracts a sizable international interest
from players across the hospitality industry and the international
visitor’s attracted by its safari experience. The increase in
tourism numbers and the need to create accommodation to meet this
demand has posed a number of challenges. Firstly,
one of the notable concerns raised by conservationist is the
proliferation of illegal hotels and lodges in the reserve which have
threatened the natural habitat. This
concern has informed the county government decision to undertake an
audit of all lodges and hotels in the Mara. This audit is meant to
ascertain legal operation of hotels, environmental issue and
ascertain the status of their operation. The county intends to take
the necessary corrective action to ensure compliance of the hotels in
terms of both environmental and regulatory requirements. The
county government has equally embarked on an overhaul of the Mara’s
operations under a new management plan (Masai Mara Management Plan)
that incorporates international best practices in conservation. The
management plan legislation is before the Narok County assembly.
Among the provisions in the plan are strengthening the governance
structure of the park by creating a semi-autonomous board to manage
affairs in the reserve. To
improve revenue collection, the Kenya Airport Parking Services (KAPS)
has been contracted and this has resulted in the automation and
significant growth of revenue collected. In
order to ensure the local community around the reserve benefits, the
county government has established the Community support fund where
19% of revenues from the park is allocated to support the development
initiatives. The allocation is expected to promote the community’s
economic activities and reduce human-wildlife conflict in the region. Kenya’s
tourism has borne the brunt of negative travel warnings which
resulted in dwindling tourist numbers to the Mara. The past two years
has however witnessed tremendous improvement in the country’s
security which has resulted in substantial increase in visitor
numbers. The
county government is however not resting on its laurels. To ensure
tourist safety and comfort at the Mara, the county Government has
invested hugely in security by recruiting and training a total of 307
rangers. The
rangers have undergone rigorous paramilitary training at the Kenya
Wildlife Training College and also trained in various courses,
including poaching control and human-wildlife conflict management. Poaching
remains a serious concern that requires constant vigilance to arrest
the vice. To put this into context, a total of 2,700 poachers have
been arrested in the Mara eco-system and over 40,000 snares recovered
in the last 14 years. This worrying statistic reveals why security
remains a paramount concern. The
status of the Mara as a premier safari destinations remain
unchallenged, the reserve was recently ranked Africa's leading
national park by WTA, beating South Africa's Kruger National Park,
Tanzania's Serengeti National Park and Central Kalahari Game Reserve. It’s
hard to put into words an experience in the Mara, so stop debating
and procrastinating , get your safari boots on, come and experience
the magic of the Mara this holiday season.
