Kisii Senator Chris Obure will run for governor on the Jubilee Party ticket and former Constitution Implementation Commission chairman Charles Nyachae for senator. Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong i said Jubilee has identified the two to fly the party s flag. Obure chairs a caucus advocating Kisii unity. Nyachae, the son of former Minister Simeon Nyachae, has been named to President Uhuru Kenyatta s presidential campaign team. We re very confident the two will win the seats, Tong i said in Kisumu on Monday. Obure has what it takes to be governor. He is experienced, having served in government in various capacities. He has a track record and we can count on him to transform this county. The legislator said they have not identified Obure s running mate and a hopeful for woman representative. Reports indicate current Deputy Governor Joash Maangi could be Obure s running mate.
