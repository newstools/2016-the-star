Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth&rsquo;s probable bid for Nairobi governor has rattled four Jubilee hopefuls.Senator Mike Sonko, MPs Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti South), Johnson Sakaja (nominated) and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru are said to be plotting to block him from joining the party.The four, who call themselves &lsquo;the real Nairobians&rsquo;, are said to be uneasy, terming Kenneth an outsider in city politics. A source said they have met four times in three weeks to discuss how to block Kenneth from participating in the party primaries.The aspirants demanded Kenneth first fold his Kenya National Congress party when he announced he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Kenneth has said he will resign from KNC. He is expected to compete for the JP ticket.Sources close to Kenneth told the Star he has made up his mind to run in Nairobi and not Murang&rsquo;a, though he is yet to publicly declare so.Those unhappy with this decision are, however, scheming to stop his candidacy on grounds he is an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo;.&ldquo;Why is Eugene [Water CS Wamalwa] quiet of late? We cannot allow people to come from nowhere to control us here,&rdquo; the source said.Sakaja has denied being part of the team planning to lock out Kenneth, saying, &ldquo;All of them are welcome. Jubilee is open to all.&rdquo;On Monday, the four Jubilee hopefuls held a meeting at the JP Nairobi office in Westlands and later told journalists they will work together and share elective positions.&ldquo;Amongst us, we have the governor, deputy governor and the senator,&rdquo; Waweru said. Sakaja said, &ldquo;We are all fighting against one Evans Kidero, whom we intend to send home.&rdquo;Last Sunday, Kenneth said he has notified the Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u of his intention to leave KNC.
