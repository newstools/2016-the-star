Defending yourself loudly in public rallies will never save you in NYS scandal, former IG David Kimaiyo has told Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. Kimaiyo asked Murkomen to record a statement with the DCI and EACC instead of trying to get public support on the matter. "It is shameful to defend yourself in public barazas when your name has been adversely mentioned in corruption. Why should you try to get public support if you are innocent?" Kimaiyo said.

Investigative agencies will be able to unearth the truth on whether you are culpable or not," he added. Kimaiyo made his remarks in Murkomen's home turf in Iten on Saturday. He called for a lifestyle audit of the Senator, as well as other leaders linked to the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal. The former IG asked political leaders to help President Uhuru Kenyatta in the fight against runaway corruption in the government. Kimaiyo claimed he was hounded out of office because of his tough stance against corruption. "I will tell Kenyans why I was removed from office before the end of my term as IG. The public will know who was behind my removal, and why corruption escalated as soon as I left office," he said. Kimaiyo intends to unseat Murkomen in the 2017 general elections. The Senator has been adversely mentioned in the NYS scandal as having been paid Sh15 million irregularly through his law firm, Sing'oei, Murkomen & Sigei Advocates.

He called for the investigation of the two MPs, alleging that they were working in cahoots with Raila to shield former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru. "We want PAC chair and committees to launch investigations to determine if Mbadi was given a contract by Waiguru," he said.
