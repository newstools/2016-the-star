The government yesterday accused the Nation Media Group of character assassination, defamation and outright depiction of all its officers as thugs after publication of the &ldquo;Mafya House&rdquo; scandal story by Business Daily on Wednesday last week.Information CS Joe Mucheru said NMG has for the last week sought to depict the government as corrupt, inept and full of thieves through deliberately slanted and skewed reporting of the Health ministry interim audit report.In response, NMG Group Editor in Chief Tom Mshindi said the statement addressed to the Complaints Commission of the Media Council of Kenya was not signed.&ldquo;However we note the contents, we note the sentiments. We at this point do not want to comment on it because really it has been addressed to the council. We will wait for the council to give directions and we will obviously then respond as appropriate.&rdquo;
