Let us not focus on our selfish gains and instead give priority to the interests of Kenyans, Wangalwa said.The deputy governor said he is confident the opposition will trounce JP. He underscored the sacrifice Kenyans have made in the clamour for better leadership and democracy in the country, saying that should not be ignored.
