A 90-year-old woman from Kilifi county this month boarded a plane for the first time in her life after 50 years of neglect by the society due to obstetric fistula, which she contracted after giving birth.The granny, Jumwa Kai, was going to Nairobi to take part in a conference on fistula after being nominated an ambassador by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).Photo caption: Jumwa Idd Kai 90 boards a plane Jambo jet flight from Malindi to Nairobi on November 1 2016.Kai had struggled for decades until May this year, when she was treated free of charge thanks to efforts by Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation Kilifi chairperson Witness Tsuma.There was pomp and colour at the Malindi International Airport as members of MYWO organisation, led by Tsuma, escorted her to board the Jambo Jet flight.All women, including the granny, wore the traditional attire for Kilifi county Kishutu and marched in song and dance to the airport.SHUNNED AS BEWITCHED Before MYWO intervened, Kai had lost hope of ever healing and accepted living with fistula. Due to cultural beliefs and poverty, the granny from Mwarakaya village could not get treatment, despite all efforts to live a normal life. Her society believed she might have been bewitched so as not to get children.Photo caption: Jumwa Idd Kai 90 (R) with maendeleo ya Wanawake organisation women under goes screening when she chekced in at the Malindi international airport to board a flight from Malindi to Nairobi on November 1 2016.However, since May, she has been able to live comfortably after undergoing surgery.The granny told journalists that she was happy to have healed and now had only physical pains in the waist and legs, which makes it difficult to walk for long distances.Speaking in local Chonyi dialect at the airport, Kai said she had never dreamt of travelling by plane all her life, let alone surviving with the disease.She said during the 50 years of ailing, life was tough.TRAGIC INJURYAccording to the UNFPA, obstetric fistula is one of the most serious and tragic child birth injuries.The agency describes fistula as a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum caused by prolonged obstructed labour without access to timely and high quality medical treatment. it leaves women leaking urine, faeces or both, and often leads to chronic medical problems, depression, social isolation and deepening poverty, said the UNPFA report.It further states that more than two million people from sub Saharan Africa, Asia, Arab region, Latin America and the Caribbean are living with fistula.The report also states that there are 50,000-100,000 new cases that develop each year, despite the fact that the disease is curable.UNFPA is the leader in the campaign to end obstetric fistula and provide strategic vision, medical supply, training, and funds for fistula prevention, treatment and social reintegration programmes.Moreover, the international organisation usually strengthens reproductive health and emergency obstetric services to prevent fistula from occurring in the first place.For women with obstructed labour, labour that goes unattended, the labour can last up to six or seven days.THREE-DAY LABOURLike other patients, Kai was abandoned because of the smell in her body. She recalls going into labour alone in her small hut but developed pain that seemed unending. Her labour lasted three days and the baby did not come. Her sister is the one who came to her aid and rescued her to hospital.Due to traditional beliefs, Kai tried tirelessly to seek treatment from traditional healers, local dispensaries and religious groups but did not succeed.Little did she know that the obstetric fistula could be treated and heal.To date, some still believe that obstetric fistula is as a result of witchcraft and are suffering in homes.Many are normally neglected and left to die hopelessly as people do not want to get the bad smell caused by the prolonged leakage of urine.Kai s case is just an example of success story that can help thousands of others to get treatment and keep off from the retrogressive cultures.TURNING POINTNovember 1 will forever be in her memory as she jovially walked to the airport freely, smelling good in the company of other women to travel by air as one of Kenya s ambassadors of obstetric fistula.Her granddaughter, Sharlet Mwafungo, who accompanied her to Nairobi, could not hide her joy upon seeing her grandmother travelling by air after suffering for 50 years.She recalled how they struggled without success to get her treated at the Coast General Hospital. We went to the hospital but did not get medication after going to the theatre, as the number of patients had exceeded supply, she said.She said family members had completely lost hope that she would heal and had left the disease to God.It was not until May when she learned that there was a one-week fistula medical camp that would be held in Kilifi county.The event was organised by UNFPA in collaboration with the Kilifi government, the Flying Doctors Society of Africa, and the Freedom from Fistula Foundation.Photo caption: Jumwa Idd Kai 90 (R) with her granddaughter Sharlet Mwafungo at the Malindi international airport waiting to board a flight from Malindi to Nairobi on November 1 2016.The camp brought doctors to the county hospital to provide free surgical fistula repairs to the needy and poor patient. They liaised with Maendeleo Ya Wanawake. Them Mushrooms and Mzee Ngalla, a popular Bango music artiste from the Coast, helped raise awareness of the condition.Tsuma said Kai was among 40 women who benefitted from the camp but she was the oldest and the one who had suffered for longest, which earned her recognition as an ambassador.The MYWO chairperson thanked NFPA, the national and county governments and other organisations for their support.She said their target is to reach 3,000 women all over Kilifi county, as there were many suffering in the rural areas with the disease. We want women to come out and get treatment. Fistula can be treated. It s not caused by witchcraft, as many believe, she said.Before they launched the programme, she says many women were dying while others were divorced because of their condition.The women later escorted the granny to the Jambo Jet flight in song and dance until she boarded her flight to Nairobi.ANOTHER AMBASSADOR S STORYAmong those who were in the team was Luvuno Katana, 62, who was the first obstetric fistula ambassador from Magarini subcounty.She was treated on March 22 last year after suffering for 28 years.The mother of eight says she experienced fistula twice, with the first time during her third child delivery and the last during her eighth child birth.She recalls how life was tough as urine was flowing out throughout.Her room was abandoned and food could be placed on the door for her to pick and eat in the smelly dark environment. I could not stay in public places. Urine was flowing all the time, no one wanted to come near me, including my closest family members, she said.A call to her niece to seek money for Christmas is what saved her, as the girl, who is a medical practitioner, told her she could be cured.Today, she is completely healed and is a fistula ambassador and mobiliser, helping other women to get access to medication.
