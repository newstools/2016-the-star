Political theorists argue that there are two aspects to any theft of public funds, which cannot be changed: the temptation to steal; and the opportunities for theft. As such the only defence possible, is to create a system of strong deterrence in which there is an assurance that such theft will in the end be detected, and a guarantee of devastating consequences for the thief.In light of this, we can take some comfort in the fact that there have been suspects hauled before the courts over the NYS fraud which has been boiling over for the last few weeks.And these are not just the usual small fish; they are former top officers of the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, and former senior officers of the NYS.Whether they are guilty or innocent, we must wait for the courts to decide. But in the interim we can note that this is not the first time that such senior people have at last had their day in court. And so we must ask: How is it possible that even though it has long been clear that all thefts of public funds must in the end be exposed, we still find corruption running rampant through our public sector?When will those charged with the management of public funds ever come to appreciate that in the end, they will have to answer for any theft of public funds?
