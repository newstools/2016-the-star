Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka now wants IEBC to acquire equipment for use in the 2017 general election through a lease instead of purchasing the same.Kalonzo said that it will be cheaper for the country to hold the elections with the leased machines compared to the process of procuring them."We can do very cheap elections of not more than Sh10 million," Kalonzo said, "It will also avert rigging that starts at the time of procurement,""Such an arrangement will also give Kenyans hope of free and fair elections. It is good that IEBC understands that voters are not ready for another stolen election," he said.Kalonzo made the comments when he made stopovers at Malili, Salama, Sultan Hamud, Emali, Makindu and Kambu while on a meet-the-people tour on Mombasa Road.He said that he was prepared to criss-cross the whole country to woo support for his 2017 presidential bid."This time round we are not backing off, we are not going to allow anyone to play around with the destiny of this country anymore," Kalonzo said.He said that he was also ready to prove to his Cord co-principals that he was the best suited to fly the coalition's presidential flag."I will have no problem if either my brother Raila Odinga or Moses Wetang'ula proves to me that they are the best suited to face Uhuru," Kalonzo said.Read: Kalonzo woos Coast to Cord, asks Raila and Weta to allow him send Uhuru home "But as for now, every Kenyan understands that I am the best man to send Jubilee home," he added, warning Ukambani leaders against creating divisions among them.This was apparently in response to Senator Johnstone Muthama who had said that Wiper will not tolerate the Muungano Party led by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana.Kalonzo said that the only enemy in Ukambani should be Jubilee Party."You cannot compare Muungano Party of Kivutha with Maendeleo Chap Chap of Governor Alfred Mutua," he said."Unlike Chap Chap, Muungano is not affiliated to Jubilee. Let us not continue to create more division locally because our enemy number one should be Jubilee," said kalonzo.Wiper national Chair David Musila assured all the aspirants of free and fair nominations.Kalonzo was accompanied by Kajiando Governor David Nkedianye, Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior and a host of MPs.
