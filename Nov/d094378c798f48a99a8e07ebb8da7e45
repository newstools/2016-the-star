Seven KCSE candidates, four invigilators and the principal of a Bungoma school have been arrested over cheating.They were arrested at St Peters Sang'alo Secondary School in Kanduyi constituency on Tuesday and taken to Bungoma police station where they recorded statements.County education director Charles Anyika told journalists that books were found in the students' desks but that the invigilators did not notify anyone.''It was discovered that the desks had been made in such a way that there was a special place under them where candidates could hide books and other exam-related materials,'' said Anyika.He said they were alerted by an official of the Kenya National Examinations Council."I immediately picked police officers, went straight to the school and arrested the suspects,'' he said.Anyika said the group will be arraigned in court once police complete investigations.He cautioned students and teachers against cheating saying they will face the full wrath of the law.This comes days after Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang visited Busia county and announced that the ministry had succeeded in curbing exam cheating.Also read: PS Kipsang downplays delivery of KCSE papers in torn box to Kisumu centre
