Debate on Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's impeachment motion started on Wednesday with 28 MCAs present and 31 absent.The absence of the 31 has been seen as a tactic to deny the motion the requisite number to remove the Governor from office.When the floor was opened for debate, members said the absence was a clear indication that the Governor has used dubious means to avoid accountability.Unconfirmed reports indicated the MCAs who did not attend had taken a Sh20 million trip to Tanzania. The reason for the trip was unspecified.Deputy Speaker Nathaniel Ng'ang'a told the Star that the MCAs did not notify the assembly that they would be taking leave from proceedings.Also read: Impeachment motion against Mutua hits a snagBut Speaker Bernard Mung'ata ruled that the assembly could proceed since they had attained the threshold of 27 members.Ndalani MCA Stephen Muthuka who moved the motion listed numerous grounds for removing Mutua from office.Issues raised touch on violation of the constitution, procurement laws and the County Government Act."The Governor has been launching projects using county funds and branding them as Maendeleo Chap Chap activities and programmes. This is abuse of office and misuse of public funds," Muthuka said.He questioned the fictitious payment of Sh89 million for the desilting of Maruba dam and the decision to award a private firm a contract for the construction of access roads.More on this: Governor Mutua institutes 'maendeleo chap chap' model to county government projectsThe MCA said no such works were done as the county was experiencing El Nino rains at the time the contract was awarded.Muthuka added that the county has been borrowing irregularly from banks without the county assembly's approval and that there has been failure to channel county revenue to official bank accounts."The Governor has set up and maintained an M-Pesa line and paybill number 656500, to which money was and continues to be paid. But it is not deposited into the county government accounts," he said."Instead this money is withdrawn and consumed at a source, contrary to provisions of the County Government Act."Read: Machakos MCAs sign petition to impeach MutuaOther issues raised during the debate included the mismanagement of Sh600 million from the county's Roads and Public Works department.Muthuka said the funds were spent on, among other things, the irregular purchase of motor vehicles by the county government.Thirty-nine members of the assembly are required to be on board for the impeachment motion against Mutua to pass. Debate will continue on Thursday.
