Meru Governor Peter Munya has asked Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to stop lecturing the people on who to vote for in 2017.Kiunjuri earlier accused the Governor of being opposed to President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election in the polls set for August 8.Munya dismissed the Cabinet Secretary as a gun for hire to fight political battles he has no idea of and asked him to play in his league. He should be alive to the fact that Meru is independent, with elected leaders, and does not need counsel from appointees. We have been to the ballot before and never were any Merus given tutorials on who to choose as leaders."Read: Leave Raila to us, Kiunjuri tells Uhuru on corruption claimsThe Governor said in a statement on Tuesday that his interest in vying for the top seat in 2022 did not amount to being opposed to Uhuru.Munya declined to join Uhuru's Jubilee Party and instead declared that he will defend his seat on a PNU ticket.Also read: Governor Munya unanimously elected PNU leaderThe Council of Governors chairman said it was "so unfortunate" for the CS to stoop that low and hawk lies in burial ceremonies".He noted he had a right to declare interest in the seat and that the President will have left office by the time he views. His notion that I am anti-government is merely a figment of his barren imagination as my stand on who PNU supports is clear," said Munya.He added that he has declared his unequivocal support for Uhuru's re-election on more than two occasions.Munya further challenged Kunjuri to call for a political rally in Meru, not hide behind organised groups and use them to spread his "half-witted falsehoods" His Laikipia people rejected him at the ballot. He should respect those of us who toiled and attained our electoral goals," he said.The Governor reminded the CS that he is a public servant who is bound by law to desist from engaging in political activities.Munya also claimed the CS was grandstanding because he has been promised a running mate slot in 2022.He asked Kiunjuri to make a decision on whether he wants to serve the people or become a politician. It seems he has been given a brief from a paymaster, who by design or default has been unable to cause any traction in this highly competitive Meru governorship race, making him resort to importing political mercenaries to fight his battles, he said.Munya underlined that come next year, his party will define Kenyan politics.
