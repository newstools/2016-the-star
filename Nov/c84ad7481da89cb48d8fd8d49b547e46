Two hopefuls from Kiambu have urged the Jubilee Party to ensure a level playing field during nominations. Governor aspirant David Ngari (Gakuyo) and Thika Town parliamentary hopeful Patrick Wainaina said appointing sitting legislators and governors to the national campaign team may give them an unfair advantage. They spoke during a harambee for AIPCA Thika on Sunday. The two said the campaign should be managed by non-aspirants. Rev Ngari, bishop of Calvary Chosen Centre, will run for Kiambu governor against William Kabogo. Wainaina, a Thika businessman popularly known as Junglenut , will seek to unseat MP Alice Ng ang a. They said they will move to Jubilee-friendly parties if there are indications the nominations will be unfair. But Ng ang a, a member of the national secretariat appointed to spearhead President Uhuru Kenyatta s campaigns, said the team has nothing to do with local campaigns. People should not panic because none of us is in a position to influence the outcome of the Jubilee nominations as the exercise will be conducted by the IEBC, she said.
