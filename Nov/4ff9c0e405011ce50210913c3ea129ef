Beneficiaries of the KCB Foundation's youth empowerment programme, 2jiajiri, will benefit from training and apprenticeship following a partnership between the lender and Toyota Kenya yesterday. The foundation will sponsor youth to train at the Toyota Kenya academy to enhance their automotive skills. The aim of the partnership, the two said, is to encourage young people to acquire automotive and business skills that will enable them become employed or employable. At KCB group, we firmly believe that the provision of technical and business skills training, mentorship and internship opportunities as well as affordable asset and capital financing for the youth will translate into the creation of additional jobs every year, group CEO Joshua Oigara said.
