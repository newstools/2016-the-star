A parliamentary committee is angry with its chairman for sitting on reports that cost taxpayers millions of shillings to probe money lost in Kenyan embassies abroad.National Assembly Defence and Foreign Relations Committee chairman Ndung u Gethenji (Tetu) is accused of attempting to hide the rot in Kenyan embassies and missions by delaying the reports.Kitutu Chache MP Richard Onyonka last week on Wednesday asked Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso to compel Gethenji to table the reports he has withheld for more than two months. The committee seems to have a problem where reports that have been completed are not tabled because the findings are not very good, Onyonka said. It includes misuse of public funds and cases where people who were supposed to be retired are still working. The Amina Mohamed-led Foreign Affairs ministry is on the spot over Sh767.1 million which is unaccounted for. The money was collected from visas, consular fees and rental income at embassies and missions. Close to four months ago, we made several visits to different countries where we interrogated what had been happening in our embassies, Onyonka said.Auditor General Edward Ouko said four embassies, including London, Washington DC, Rome and Addis Ababa, lost Sh137.7 million.
