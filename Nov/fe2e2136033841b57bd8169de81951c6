Coast ODM politicians facing disciplinary action for ditching the party have said they are not afraid of by-elections.Speaking separately to the Star, the politicians dared ODM to field candidates in their regions.Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro said he is ready for the disciplinary action taken by the party.He said he will stand with the 10 members who have been expelled and wait for his lawyer s advice on whether to meet the ODM disciplinary committee.Mung aro spoke in Mryachakwe village, Ganze, on Monday, shortly after the National Governing Council expelled the ODM rebels, including Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima and Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga. We shall follow our lawyer s directions, and listen to his advice on whether to face the committee. This has been a separation period. If there will be a divorce, the announcement will be made when the time comes, Mung aro said.Chidzuga dismissed her expulsion, saying the National Executive Council, which endorsed the NGC decision, is in office illegally.She questioned who elected nominated Senator Agnes Zani and her team, yet the party s internal elections collapsed after chaos sparked by the Men in Black in 2014.Chidzuga spoke in Ngodo, Lunga Lunga, where she distributed relief food to starving residents.She said she is still the Kwale woman representative by virtue of being elected by residents and she is still a member of ODM as she has been paying monthly party fees. I have been working according to the ODM manifesto of serving people and exercising my democratic right of freedom of expression and association, Chidzuga said.The party leadership has not served her with papers of expulsion, she said. Chidzuga said she will not work with dictators who do not want to be criticised when they go wrong.Mwahima, a second-term MP, said, I was voted to that parliamentary seat by my people whom I dine and drink with every day, not people sitting in offices in Nairobi. Speaking to the Star on the phone, he said his die-hard supporters will reelect him to continue the work he started. Mwahima had earlier chased away journalists who sought comment from his office over the expulsion.He said his expulsion is not a blow to him or other defectors, as they had expected it from the dictatorial party .The former minority chief whip described the ODM expulsion plan as political and told party officials to do what they want .He said the team of ODM rebels from the Coast will fight for their rights.Mung aro said the same ODM leadership sacked him as minority chief whip without giving him an opportunity to be heard.
