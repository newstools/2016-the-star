Siaya Senator James Orengo s entry into the governor race has caused panic in incumbent Cornel Rasanga s campaign team.They will have to come up with a strategy to counter the witty and seasoned politician.Those who spoke to the Star said they fear Orengo s mastery of political strategy and oratory skills.Rasanga s campaign team is led by political adviser Oloo Okanda, the former Alego-Usonga ODM chairman. Okanda said Orengo announces his bid at the eleventh hour, catching his rivals off guard, and goes on to win. This was in reference to the 2013 general election where Orengo said he would defend his Ugenya seat only to ambush nominated MP Oburu Oginga by announcing he would run for senator. This left Oburu with no option but to run for the ODM governor ticket against William Oduol. Both were disqualified.
