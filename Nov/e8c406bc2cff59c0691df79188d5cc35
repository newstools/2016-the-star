Daily use of boda bodas is partly to blame for rising cases of eye problems as passengers subject their eyes to too much dust, a Health ministry official has said.Eye surgeon George Nderitu on Sunday said many Kenyans don t like walking even for 100 metres. Instead, they prefer taking a boda boda, leading to body laziness , he said.Nderitu said when the body is idle, it becomes vulnerable to diseases, such as diabetese, which, subsequently, cause eye problem.He recommended body exercise as one of the prevention measures of non -communicable diseases such as diabetes, stroke, cancer and heart diseases. The change of lifestyle, including lack of exercise and taking of sodas, can be blamed for diseases because of excessive sugar and fat in the body. Once you are diagnosed with diabetes, it leads to eye problems which can lead to blindness, he said.Nderitu said other causes of eye problems include continued eye exposure to too much light on screens of TVs, computers and mobile phones. Children s caregivers, especially in this long holiday season, should ensure they are not exposed to dust. I also urge Kenyans to use cold water when washing their faces, instead of hot water. It is also good for Kenyans to go for screening regularly, he added.Nderitu was speaking during a free eye medical clinic at Unjiru Community Hall in Othaya, Nyeri county.More than 300 patients benefitted from the clinic, which was sponsored by the Unjiru Development Network and the Kenya Society for the Blind.Unjiru Network chairman Cyrus Kanyi said this has been an annual event, but this year it focused on eyes due to increased cases of eye problems among residents.He said a few of those with serious cases were referred to Nyeri Referral Hospital for operation.
