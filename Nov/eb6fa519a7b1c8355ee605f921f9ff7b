DP has started registering hopefuls eyeing political seats in next year&rsquo;s election. National chairman Esau Kioni (pictured) yesterday said candidates have started thronging party headquarters to register for life membership, especially after they were disappointed by the list of those named in the Jubilee Party campaign team.&ldquo;My phone is jammed with calls. Aspirants have been enquiring about the party ticket since last week. They have to register as life members first,&rdquo; he said.Kioni said they decided against dissolving the party and merging with JP. He said, however, DP will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection. Kioni said most of the aspirants are from the Mt Kenya, Rift Valley and Nairobi.He said the party has received requests for governor, MP and MCA tickets.&ldquo;Those who know the party are rushing now. They don&rsquo;t want to rush when it&rsquo;s too late. We expect more to register as we get close to the elections,&rdquo; Kioni said. &ldquo;Those thinking they will benefit after the party hopping deadline might lose it, as we shall block them should they come at the last minute,&rdquo; Kioni said.He urged those supporting Uhuru to go out to other regions to campaign for him, instead of focusing on Mt Kenya, which is solidly behind the President. Kioni urged them to use their resources to popularise Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection bid. DP was formed in the run-up to the 1992 general election. Presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki ran for election on its ticket in 1992 and 1997, and in 2002 the party joined others under the National Rainbow Coalition to remove long-ruling Kanu from power.
