The High Court has temporarily stopped the registration of new office bearers of the Kenya Squash Rackets Association (KSRA). In an order issued on November 2, Justice Mbogholi Msagha ruled that the Registrar of Sports should not issue a certificate confirming the elections of new officials purportedly elected on October 27. The judge directed the applicant David Theuri to serve the respondents, including Gituro Wainaina and Harania Anish, with the court papers ahead of the hearing on November 14. Also to be served with the court papers is the Attorney General. The order also restrained the Registrar from validating the results of the election. The KSRA have not held an AGM since 2011. Similarly, no audited accounts have been shared in the last five years. This fact comes out in the AGM notice as an agenda item. Members who (in good faith) try to raise these issues are personally attacked, some singled out for legal action.
