Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga yesterday urged his fellow county bosses to elect Bomet s Isaac Rutto as the CoG chairman. Rutto is ex-chairman.Rasanga said they need a strong candidate as the country heads into the election nine months away. We need someone like Rutto who can advocate our welfare boldly before, during and after the elections, as we cannot rule out victimisation now that everyone wants to be the governor, Rasanga said.Addressing the press in his office, he said he will lobby his fellow governors to pick Rutto. He said they cannot afford to gamble with the position of chairman of Council of Governors.Rasanga said the new chairman should be politically influential and neutral. Earlier, outgoing CoG chairman Peter Munya had proposed Kisumu Governor Jack Ragumu as his successor, but Rasanga is not interested.Munya will leave office at the end of the year, paving the way for election of a new CoG chairman. Rutto was the first chairman. He served for two terms before Munya took over. The chairman s term is one year. He can only serve for two terms. Rasanga advised that electing a strong partisan from either side of the political divide will promote favouritism and result in unfair leadership in addressing governors concerns.He commended Rutto and Munya for their exemplary leadership. Munya was elected on May 21, 2015, during the the annual CoG meeting in Nairobi. The election had been preceded by intense behind-the-scenes lobbying by both the ruling Jubilee Alliance and opposition Cord. Cord, which has 25 of the 47 governors, fronted Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Another contender was Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya.
