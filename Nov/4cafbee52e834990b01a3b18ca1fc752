Opposition Chief Raila Odinga has hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta accusing him of using State Security machinery to secretly monitor and tap his private phone conversations.Raila wondered how Uhuru knew that, he was yesterday afternoon, going to address a press conference on the controversial Itare Darm water supply project situated at the Mau water tower."I know they are listening to my phone call and they heard me talk with somebody this morning, the President's statement to preempt my statement is unfortunate," Raila said at a press conference in his Capital Hill office.Raila termed as a circus, the Jubilee Party National Delegates Convention at Bomas, saying the meeting had no a clear agenda on party affairs.He said Jubilee had devised a strategy to brand him a propagandist intimidate, blackmail and silence the opposition from critricising the government."I am not a government employee to be silenced, i will continue to speak about the ills of Jubilee objectively because that is my role. Where the government has performed well i give credit and where it is erring i point out," he said.The Cord leader pointed out that time has proved him right that the corruption issues he has flagged out in government are real and not mere propaganda."If you followed the Public Accounts Committee investigations, can you call Raila a propagandist? No. Facts with remain facts. The president is trying to wish away the scandals including the NYS," he said.Asked if he is trying to gain political mileage through the 'scandals' rocking the Jubilee government, Raila said, "nothing is far from the truth, i have no reason to benefit from this."The Cord leader challenged President Uhuru to respond to matters corruption raised against his administration urgently."The issues we have raised need answers, Mr President stop wasting time calling NGC and give answers," he said.On the Sh5 billion scandal that has hit the ministry of Health Raila accused the ministry officials of trying to undermine a 'complete' internal report which poked holes in the management of funds at Afya House."An internal audit report is a complete report not a draft report. The internal auditor has raised queries that were not answered. It is the Auditor general to pick up the issues and incorporate them in his report," he said.The former prime minister was apprehensive that ministry of Health officials could be cooking figures to bury the massive graft.On the other hand the opposition leader argued that the construction of Itare Dam in Bomet county will divert at least five rivers at the source in Mau forest for onward transmission to feed personal projects by senior Jubilee leaders in Naivasha in Nakuru county and Ruiru in Nairobi county.He accused the government of going on with the project against the will of the residents despite adverse environmental effects that threatens the Mau ecosystem.He said there was no environmental Impact assessment made and that the government forged signatures to proof a non-existent public participation."Public participation was carried out among the people of Nakuru," he said adding that an urgent consultative forum for all communities living in the Lake Victoria Basin.
