Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki (pictured) has warned civil servants at the Huduma Centres against engaging in corruption.Instead, she urged them to dedicate themselves to deliver services efficiently and impartially.Kariuki said the government will not tolerate graft and those engaging in unlawful acts will be punished.She made the comments at the Acacia Hotel in Kisumu on Friday during a workshop for Huduma Centre managers. The CS reminded the managers to focus on their core responsibility of serving Kenyans as enshrined in the Constitution.She was accompanied by Huduma Centre secretary Dennis Mutuku, and MPs Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East) and William Kipsang (Marakwet West). Huduma Centres have tremendously improved services to citizens since their inception. Currently, 16 countries are studying the concept with a view to implementing it. This shows it has impacted positively on Kenyans, Kariuki said. She said they are expanding the centres to the subcounties, saying there are 43 operational centres in 39 counties, with six more to be commissioned soon. Kariuki said this will ease access to services.The MPs commended President Uhuru Kenyatta over the flagship project, which, they said, has eliminated red tape that previously made Kenyans shy away from seeking services. Bowen expressed satisfaction with services offered at the centres and called for more funding from the national Treasury to support their expansion. Kisumu county commissioner Maalim Mohamed echoed the sentiments.
