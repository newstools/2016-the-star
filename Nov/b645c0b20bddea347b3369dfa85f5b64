Nominated MP Oburu Oginga (pictured) has asked Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria to respect him and stop calling him a mere nominated MP.Kuria discredited Oburu after he demanded that President Uhuru Kenyatta explain how scandals involving loss of public funds were evolving around those close to him without his knowledge. I will insist that the President tells us what he knows about the scams until he looks for ways to pay back our money, Oburu said.
