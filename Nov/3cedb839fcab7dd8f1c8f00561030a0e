The national and county governments, donors, the private sector and civil society groups have formed the Youth Sector Working Group to coordinate employment initiatives. The agency will be co-chaired by Agriculture CS Willy Bett and German Ambassador Jutta Frasch. The Public Service ministry will act as a support secretariat. We are all aware of the number of youth coming into the labour market yearly. That is why the government needs to design strategies to create opportunities for them so that they can be entrepreneurs in their own right and create jobs for fellow youths, Bett said. He spoke during the inauguration of the team yesterday at Harambee House. Bett said the group s immediate task is to finalise the Youth Empowerment Strategy and facilitate wider public engagement on the National Youth Policy review process and bring the process up to date.
