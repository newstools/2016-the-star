Kenyans are among the most heavily taxed people in the world but now face double taxation.On top of being taxed in the price of fuel and VAT, they will now be charged road tolls as the government collects only Sh50 billion from the Fuel Levy against the required Sh150 billion, a massive shortfall.In an attempt to close that great gap the government is setting up toll stations on the Thika Superhighway, the Southern Bypass and other roads, among them the Mombasa-Nairobi highway and the Nairobi-Naivasha-Nakuru Mau Summit highway in five years.The purpose of the Fuel Levy is to pay for the cost of road building and maintenance.If the government wants to raise some money the better thing to do, instead of double taxation, is to just increase the Fuel Levy and charge more for petrol.The toll stations are likely to benefit only the well off and become an imposition on everyone else the vast majority - beginning in an election year.
