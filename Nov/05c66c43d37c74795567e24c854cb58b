The hearing of a case against former Juja MP George Thuo&rsquo;s widow and four others over a Sh28 million tender at the Kenya Pipeline Company failed to take off for the fifth time yesterday. The case was to be heard before Milimani Anti-Corruption court principal magistrate Felix Kombo, but lawyers raised an objection on the grounds that &ldquo;the suspects may not get a fair hearing.&rdquo; Former KPC managing director Charles Tanui is accused of awarding the tender irregularly to Redline Company Ltd owned by Judy Thuo for the installation of autotransformers. Thuo and Tanui are charged alongside the former company&rsquo;s chief engineer Josphat Sirma and chief technical manager Elias Karumi. They face six counts of abuse of office and failing to comply with procurement rules in awarding the contract. Thuo is separately charged with acquiring public funds illegally. Proceedings resume this morning .
