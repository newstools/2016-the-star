One person was injured when a section of Bukhungu Stadium, under construction, collapsed on Saturday. The worker was trying to jump off the structure when the wall caved in. Kakamega Lands executive Alfred Matianyi said the contractor was reconstructing parts of the building as recommended by the Confederation of African Football a month ago when the incident occurred. The contractor was putting a slab on the section that CAF inspectors recommended that the height be in line with the international standards. Some props that had been erected came down due to negligence, he said on the phone yesterday. However, Matianyi said the building is steady and there is no cause for alarm. Investigations will be carried out to establish the cause of the accident, said Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kutima at the stadium's site. The first phase of the stadium, which costs Sh800 million, is expected to be ready by December 12 for launching. The stadium, with a seating capacity of 30,000 people, will be the third to meet international standards after Safaricom Kasarani and Machakos stadia. Matianyi said the stadium is expected to be complete in four years. A source in the CAF said the structure seems to be okay. But I cannot give the technical opinion because I am not an engineer. The specifications are well put, the source who sought anonymity said.
