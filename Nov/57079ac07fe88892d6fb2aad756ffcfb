A former nominated MCA wants the Supreme Court to extend the period for her to file her petition at the court.Naomi Wangeci from Nyeri county said the lower courts have not delivered justice and the apex court should hear the case.Making submissions before Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, judges Mohamed Ibrahim, Jackton Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala and Njoki Ndung u, her lawyer Kibe Muigai said the court should set the record straight by hearing the suit. He said the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to strip Wangeci, Hanna Kabui, Ann Nyambura and Leah Mumbi of their positions as members of the Nyeri assembly. If the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to strip the applicants of their positions as MCAs, aren t they entitled to knock on the doors of this court in search of justice? Muigai said. He said there are several issues the court should determine as they are real grievances that have led to the suit.In 2014, chief magistrate Wilbroda Juma said the TNA nomination list of the MCAs was against the Court of Appeal s verdict delivered on November 8, 2013.She said the IEBC blindly certified a faulty list.
