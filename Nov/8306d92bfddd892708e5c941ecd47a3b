Cord leader Raila Odinga has condemned the police assault on Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto saying "a worrying agenda of hate and intolerance" is taking root.Rutto was airlifted to Nairobi after a policeman's tear gas canister allegedly hit him in his county on Sunday. He had a swollen face and a red eye."This (is the) government s way of dealing with dissents and opponents, real or perceived," Raila said on Monday.He noted when he visited the Governor at Nairobi Hospital that freedom of assembly, speech and association is guaranteed by the constitution."Going by the trend, we have reason to believe things will take more ominous turn as we get closer to elections and as Jubilee comes under greater scrutiny," said the Cord leader.Raila said the country must not be allowed to recede to the era of "primitive use" of government resources for the protection of partisan and illegal political interests."Intimidation and threats have been on the lips and in the actions of key leaders of the Jubilee administration for some time now," he said."It must not be allowed to shape our politics and public life again. We have been there before and we must never go there again."Rutto said police officers threw a tear gas canister at him when he asked why some youths had been arrested.He was attending a church service at Njerian AGC, Silibwet Township ward, when he received text messages of complaints by youths who were allegedly arrested.More on this: Rutto rushed to Nairobi Hospital after scuffle with policeBut Bomet county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai defended police saying they did not use excessive force on the youths, whom he said wanted to interrupt a match at Silibwet stadium.Leparmarai also dismissed as fabricated, reports that officers injured Rutto during the fracas that erupted between two groups of supporters.Rutto stormed the stadium seeking an explanation on why his supporters were arrested, Leparmarai said.He claimed an officer hurled a tear gas canister at him but the commissioner defended the actions they took saying they tried to avert chaos during a match between Bunge and Silibwet FCs. The claims by the Governor that police targeted him and even hit him with a tear gas canister are totally fictitious," said Leparmarai."Teargas canisters are fired and so when one talks of being hit with it I wonder, since the magnitude of the damage on someone s face would be so devastating."He told the press in Bomet town that the outcome would have been worse had police not played a "key role".Leparmarai further said Ruto was to blame as his security officers advised him to stay away but he did not listen.He pointed out that his act amounted to bullying and accused Rutto of wanting to disrupt a game organised by MPs. Why would someone intrude an event to which he was not invited? If he was hit by a stone pelted by the youth then that is 'another story'," he said.Leparmarai further condemned the Governor saying he habitually shifts blame to him and police officers when such incidents occur. He has always accused us and claimed we get instructions from above, which is totally false. We are simply doing our work so let him stop blaming us,' he said."In fact he is the one who has always been bringing goons to functions including those attended by Deputy President William Ruto for reasons we do not know."The function was attended by National assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso, Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central), Paul Savimbi (Chepalungu), Leonard Sang (Buret) and Jospat Kirui (Ndaraweta).The leaders said they were dismayed by the hooliganism that erupts at county functions.Bomet Knut executive secretary Malel Langat asked IG Joseph Boinnet and IPOA to conduct thorough investigations and ensure those responsible for the chaos are punished.Julius Kones, National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman, asked Bomet leaders to exhibit decorum and call on their supporters to maintain peace during 2017 campaigns."It's regrettable to note that such incidents are becoming a likely occurrence whenever Rutto and Laboso happen to be attending the same function," said Kones."It now appears obvious that they do not seem to be willing to control their supporters. If this culture is allowed to continue, the bad image of our county will get worse."
