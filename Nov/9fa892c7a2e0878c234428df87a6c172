Former Africa 5000m junior champion Moses Mukono will be seeking to make a comeback during the first Athletics Kenya cross country series meeting in Nairobi tomorrow. Mukono has been out of competition for the past one year and is determined to return to the form that saw him crowned the 2014 Africa cross country junior champion in Kampala, Uganda. It has been a tough year but I am now back. My training for the last few months has been phenomenal and I am looking forward to running in my first competitive race come Saturday, said Mukono, who is also the 2014 world junior 5000m bronze medallist. I have been training in Ngong under the Rongai Athletics Club where my new coach David Ouma and my friend Manang oi (World 1500m silver medallist) have been of great help. Mukono said he will use AK cross country and weekend meetings as a build-up towards his comeback bid. My initial target is running in the local cross country series with an aim of completing at world cross country championships in March next year, In Kampala, Uganda said Mukono. At the 2015 world cross in Guiyang, China, Mukono returned a 16th place and believes he is ready to work up the standings in Uganda. My success in the cross country will also help me achieve my goal of running in the world championships, whose next edition will be held in London in July.
