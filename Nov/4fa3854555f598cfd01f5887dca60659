Many residents in drought-hit areas of Kilifi county may continue to suffer because the national and county governments are not working together in distributing relief food. More focus is on Ganze and Magarini subcounties, leaving out other equally affected areas. The county would distribute food in a particular area and the national government returns with more food for the same place in three days.Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa three weeks ago urged the two governments to harmonise food distribution. This will help us know where the county government has distributed food so we can go to another place, which has not yet received food, he said in Ganze. When the county launched food distribution in August at Sokoke Primary School in Ganze subcounty, the national government took food to the Sokoke chief s office after two days.
