Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye yesterday accused the EACC of applying double standards in fighting corruption.Nkedianye said he doubts the anti-graft agency stands a chance of &ldquo;bailing Kenya out of corruption that is threatening to cripple the economy.&rdquo;He said the country is headed for the the darkest times because of numerous unresolved corruption cases in the national and county governments. The governor spoke at the Maasai Technical Training College in Kajiado where he attended the launch of the county&rsquo;s executive and assembly corruption risk assessment week.&ldquo;I have forwarded many corruption cases in the lands sector, perpetrated by senior public officers posted in Kajiado. None has been resolved,&rdquo; Nkedianye said.He said this graft is carried out by county land offices where public servants collude with cartels to defraud owners of their property.&ldquo;How can one explain cases where senior national government officers posted to Kajiado have now become members of group ranches? It has never happened anywhere in the country but is rampant in Kajiado,&rdquo; Nkedianye said. He predicted economic collapse if the EACC does not change.
