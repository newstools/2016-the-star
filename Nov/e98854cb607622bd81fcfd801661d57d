Drought and famine featured in the annual 7-day walk conducted by Kaya elders from Malindi district cultural association.The group concluded the activity on Tuesday after covering 350 kilometers within Kilifi county, describing this year's even as 'hectic'.Looking frail after the long-distance trek in the hot sun, the group sounded an alarm over the killings meted on elderly men suspected of witchcraft in the region. Joseph Karisa, the group's secretary general, said they received reports of youths who kill motorbike thieves and feast on their meat."We found out that youths also kill suspects stealing motorbikes, they roast the meat, and eat it with palm wine," he said.Even though the report of people feasting on human meat has not been proven, cases of people being killed has been rampant in the area.Karisa said they advised the youths to stop the practice and embrace peace instead of brewing clashes.He said that they also came across communities fighting over pasture and water, further reporting that the groups were advised to live in peace."This year s walk was tough, we walked in drought stricken areas which had no food or water," Karisa said."We came across animals dying due to drought as well as people sharing water with animals," he said.Read: Thousands in Kwale face starvation as drought bite The group, which moved around in Mijikenda traditional regalia, left Malindi on October 21 and traversed three constituencies.They went through Jilore, Adimaye in Chakama, Shakahola, and Bofu in Malindi constituency before proceeding to Mrima wa Ndege, Ganze and Mtondia in Kilifi North.Mrima wa Ndege in Ganze has a rescue center for elderly men under threat of being lynched over suspected witchcraft.Karisa said their peace messages were received well by the people they spoke with during the walk, including the need for tranquility during the 2017 polls.He thanked the national government for offering them transport for ferrying their food and catering teams as well as for assigning police to escort them.
