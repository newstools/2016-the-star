The National Cereals and Produce Board has said it has Sh6 billion to buy maize. Managing director Newton Terer yesterday announced all maize-buying centres have been opened. He said the board will buy maize at Sh3,000 per 90kg bag. I want to appeal to all maize farmers, particularly in the North Rift, to deliver their produce to the nearest NCPB depot, Terer said. He said most NCPB stores have cleared the old stock and are ready to receive fresh maize. Terer spoke in Kapsabet town, Nandi county. What we want is for the farmers to deliver clean maize with low moisture content, the MD said.Terer said payment for delivered maize will be done as soon as the produce is delivered. Should we exhaust the funds we have, we will not hesitate to seek more money from the National Treasury, he said. Terer also urged farmers to prepare their farms early for the next planting season.
