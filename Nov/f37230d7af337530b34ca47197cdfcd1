The National Cereals and Produce Board has said it has Sh6 billion to buy maize. Managing director Newton Terer yesterday announced all maize-buying centres have been opened. He said the board will buy maize at Sh3,000 per 90kg bag. &ldquo;I want to appeal to all maize farmers, particularly in the North Rift, to deliver their produce to the nearest NCPB depot,&rdquo; Terer said. He said most NCPB stores have cleared the old stock and are ready to receive fresh maize. Terer spoke in Kapsabet town, Nandi county. &ldquo;What we want is for the farmers to deliver clean maize with low moisture content,&rdquo; the MD said.Terer said payment for delivered maize will be done as soon as the produce is delivered. &ldquo;Should we exhaust the funds we have, we will not hesitate to seek more money from the National Treasury,&rdquo; he said. Terer also urged farmers to prepare their farms early for the next planting season.
