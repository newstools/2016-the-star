The Senate Public Accounts and Investment committee is considering summoning Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi over the alleged theft of more than Sh1.18 billion from the county government. The committee said it would use its oversight powers to probe the loss of funds. Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said, Kingi has done a commendable job of initiating investigations into the scam, but it s high time we as a committee use our oversight mandate and summon him for further probing. Omar said governors like Kingi who show willingness to fight graft should have the full support of the committee. Committee chairman Anyang Nyong o (Kisumu) seconded Omar s proposal. Preliminary investigations conducted by the Kilifi government special oversight committee established that the funds were illegally transferred from the county accounts to private ones.
