The NCTC was established in September 2003 after a Cabinet meeting, becoming the first such centre in the world. It was inaugurated in 2004 when it became an organ of the National Security Advisory Council. Many confuse the NCTC with the ATPU. The Anti-Terror Police Unit is represented in the NCTC.
