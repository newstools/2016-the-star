City lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi wants the EACC to investigate CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge for miraculously running the bank as a one-man show .Through his Nairobi Law Monthly publication, Ahmednasir in the criminal complaint filed at the EACC said the governor incurred expenses and created liability without authority or supervision of the board of directors as required by the law. Njoroge, notwithstanding the patronage he so enjoys, must be investigated properly. He has breached the law and this must be addressed through a proper bona fide investigation by your organisation, he said. He has been miraculously running CBK as a one-man show. The CBK Act says the governor cannot incur any expenses without the approval of the board of directors.The bank s management led by Njoroge operated for about 18 months without a board. On November 8, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed the board members to join chairman Mohamed Nyaoga.Nyaoga was appointed in June last year alongside Njoroge. The term of the previous board ended in March last year, meaning that no board meetings have been held since. This is despite the law providing board meetings be held once every two months with a quorum of five members.Ahmednasir s claim raises questions on key decisions by the governor on Imperial Bank and the reopening of Chase bank. They were made without a board, despite constitutional and legal challenges. New currency notes have not been printed. Njoroge has been incurring huge capital expenditure without any board appraisal, authority or supervision. He has in the process abused his office, usurped the powers of the board and acted in flagrant breach of the law, Ahmednasir he said.
