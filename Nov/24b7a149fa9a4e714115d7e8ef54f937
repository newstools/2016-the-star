Mwingi North MP John Munuve has said he would never consider returning to Wiper.Politician Gabriel Kathanzu had urged Munuve to ditch the Jubilee Party for Wiper to easily reclaim his seat. The two met in Kyamwiu village, Kitui county, during a party for resident John Maithya who graduated from JKUAT last Friday. Kathanzu on Saturday said, Mheshimiwa, you are in a Wiper zone and voters are more likely to reelect you in Wiper. But Munuve said, There s no way I m returning to Wiper. Over my dead body. He said he would be denied the Wiper ticket if he sought reelection on the party ticket. Kalonzo Musyoka, the Wiper leader, has already fronted his son to run for my seat. Is he that daft to deny his son the ticket and give it to me if I won the nomination? he said.
