Nairobi government executives and 400 staff got a reprieve yesterday after the High Court blocked their eviction from City Hall, Northern Wing.In September, speaker Alex ole Magelo gazetted the City Hall s Northern Wing as county assembly s precincts and told Governor Evans Kidero s team to relocate its 400 staff to City Annex.Yesterday, Kidero s team filed an urgent application, saying they feared the assembly was about to illegally evict them. Justice George Odunga issued temporary orders, barring Magelo and the assembly from evicting or blocking the executives from accessing the building, pending the conclusion of the application. I m satisfied the application raises a prima facie case. Let the motion be filed and served within seven days, he ruled.Justice Odunga also allowed the executives to seek orders quashing the gazette notice. He told both parties to appear on December 13 for directions.The Assembly claims the Northern Wing, which stretches from the basement parking to the fifth floor, is their space. The executives insist the space is theirs.The workers have opposed attempts to relocate them, saying it could impede operations and undermine key services. According to suit papers, the disputed space is used by the Rating and Audit department. Millions of shillings will be lost due to disruption of services. The workers have no alternative office to which they can relocate, county secretary Robert Ayisi said.The staff say the decision by Magelo is unreasonable and in bad faith. The assembly gave fourth floor occupants 30 days to leave. The Evaluation team on the same floor was given 60 days to move. The basement was to be cleared immediately, the court heard.The assembly with 140 staff occupies the first and second floors of City Hall.
