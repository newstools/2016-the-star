Cord's war on graft has kept the government on its toes and is promoting appropriate use of public funds, some Kanu leaders in West Pokot have said.Speaking at Kaibos, Senator John Loyangapuo and Kenya Civil Aviation Authority chairman Samuel Poghisio said the coalition is ensuring that public funds are not embezzled. The government should allow Cord to perform its duties. In every country, there must be an opposition that acts as a watchdog, Lonyangapuo said.The two said the coalition has helped save taxpayers' funds from misuse.They urged the government to cooperate with the opposition and let it carry out its mandate.This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta accused the opposition of peddling propaganda to demean his government.They also said that Kanu will support Uhuru's reelection bid, but will not merge with teh Jubilee Party.Lonyangapuo said the party is not ready to lose its identity by merging with other parties. We are fighting to see that Kanu remains strong in this county and nation at large. We are not moving to join Jubilee but we shall support Uhuru for presidency, Poghisio said.He said Kanu is not an enemy of the Jubilee administration as portrayed by some leaders.Lonyangapuo wants to run for governor and Poghisio wants to contest for senator.They asked leaders from outside the county who come to drum up support for the Jubilee Party to respect elected leaders. We are not barring anybody from visiting this county, but when they come they should not insult elected leaders, Poghisio said.Lonyangapuo added that all parties are free to hold meetings.He asked parties and leaders not to disrupt opponents' meetings. We need peaceful campaigns and elections free from violence, Lonyangapuo said.
