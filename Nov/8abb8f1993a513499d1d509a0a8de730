Some Jubilee-allied MPs were on Thursday overheard laughing aloud about the activities of an outspoken first-term MP from Nyanza.

Corridors can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether this is the official Ministry of Corruption in Kenya.***********After failing to remove a contractor he hired to renovate his city building using legal means, a tycoon-cum- politician has now resorted to uncouth methods to force his way.

But before the contractor started enjoying the fruits of his labour, the tycoon wants him out. First, the tycoon unsuccessfully used the city authorities, before the matter ended up in court. But even as the dispute is still pending in court, several youths were spotted behind the building last Sunday dousing it with petrol in an attempt to set it ablaze, but their plan failed when some women noticed them and raised the alarm. **********Is it true that some officials associated with State House operatives are blackmailing some women into having sex with them before the women are paid?
