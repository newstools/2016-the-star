The President's "rush" move to recall Kenyan troops from Juba, South Sudan, was driven by ego and the deliberate misinterpretation of the law, opposition chief Raila Odinga has said.The withdrawal of KDF followed the dismissal of Kenyan Commander of peacekeeping force in Sudan Lieutenant General Johnson Kimani Ondieki by the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon for allegedly failing to prevent civilian deaths.President Uhuru Kenyatta recalled the troops saying Kenya could no longer be part of a mission that had failed and that the country's dignity, honour and pride had to be protected.More on this: [VIDEO] Kenya unapologetic about pulling troops from South Sudan, says UhuruBut Raila told Uhuru that under the 2010 constitution, he neither has the exclusive mandate in matters military, nor can he purport to have military authority over forces.Noting national security is subject to the authority of the constitution and Parliament, Raila said Uhuru does not have the sole mandate in the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces. It is Parliament, not the President, that has overall authority over the military," the Cord leader said in a statement on Monday. Indeed, the reason the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces is because he is a civilian. His position epitomises the civilian authority of the people of Kenya over their military."Article 239(5) of the constitution says national security organs are subordinate to civilian authority.Read: Personal emotions, pride making Uhuru pull troops out of South Sudan - Wetang'ulaAlso read: Raila chides Uhuru for pulling KDF out of S.Sudan, move driven by anger, madness'Autocratic President'Raila further took issue with the way the President has arrogated to himself power over our military on the basis that he is the Commander-in-Chief, without seeking authority from Parliament. This position is autocratic as it is unconstitutional and outdated. Long gone are the days of the Kenya African Rifles and the Kenya Armed Forces that existed to protect the regime from its own people, he said. Even in Monarchies, the monarchs no longer have the power to wake up and do as they wish without the approval of the people through their elected representatives."The Cord boss said Kenya's military belongs to the people and exists for the sole purpose of protecting them.He said their withdrawal denies soldiers not only the allowances they get on such missions, which are shared with the country, but also the invaluable experience they acquire on such assignments. These are now lost as a result of rush action by a regime that has refused to make the transition to the new order, he said.Raila urged the President to drop the chest-thumping and engage rather than confront the United Nations, as the damage already done will take longer to undo since Kenya will bear the brunt.Read: First batch of Kenyan troops arrives from South Sudan after Uhuru orderAlso read: Engage UN over withdrawal of KDF troops from South Sudan, Japan tells UhuruUhuru's action, Raila noted, was the latest indication that Kenyans are dealing with a regime that has refused to internalise the constitution and to make the transition to the new constitutional order.He said Uhuru and Ruto must not be allowed to mislead the country given that the new relationship between the military and citizens is captured in the constitution, and that the National Security Council was given the mandate to deploy forces.Section 240 of the constitution establishes the National Security Council which is presided over by the President.It states: "The council may, with the approval of Parliament, deploy national forces outside Kenya for regional or international peace support operations or other support operations", and "approve the deployment of foreign forces in Kenya".The constitution gives the Commander-in-Chief the mandate to recall soldiers without necessarily seeking Parliament's approval."Hypocrisy and bankruptcy"On Sunday, DP William Ruto dismissed Raila for criticising Uhuru's decision, saying the Head of State, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces, can make whichever decision he pleases.Ruto said Kenya is a sovereign state where the President has a right to give direction on how security issues should be handled and does not rely on outsiders for advice on matters pertaining to security. President Uhuru Kenyatta is the Commander in Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces and knows his role on matters of security. The President does not make decisions on the basis of political directions but on security analysis, he said.More on this: Ruto hits back at opposition leaders for questioning Kenya's decision to withdraw troops from South SudanSpeaking separately, Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki said the opposition was embracing "hypocrisy and bankruptcy" and engaging in double-speak.Kindiki told a press briefing in Mitheru that the matter was of national interest and should not be politicised. Why are they calling for thee withdrawal of troops from Somalia yet they are making a lot of noise troops from South about withdrawing troops from South Sudan?" he asked. Staying in a peace keeping process is purely for national interests. The government felt it could not condone what happened to Ondieki. The dignity, pride and professionalism of Kenyan peacekeepers abroad would have been jeopardised."Kinidiki, who is Tharaka Nithi Senator, said Kenya needed to tell the world that it has good soldiers who do a good job."When that dignity is violated, we react. That is how international relations works... It is not a love affair, he said.He singled out Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, whom he said is trying to "find space" by constantly criticising the government, as he is "politically inconsequential".Mudavadi had told off the President in an address in Elgeyo Marakwet county on Sunday, saying his decision was hasty and unwise .
