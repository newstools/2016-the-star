November is the exclusive examination month and 952,445 KCPE exam candidates are sitting for the assessment from today to Thursday.Some 577,079 KCSE exam candidates will face the test from November 7-30.After last year s unprecedented leakage and cheating, Education CS Fred Matiang i has assured Kenyans of stringent measures to restore credibility.Head teachers will be exam centre managers in the 26,308 KCPE centres countrywide.The Ministry of Education is working alongside that of ICT and Internal security for round-the-clock monitoring of exam papers. You are directly accountable, responsible and answerable for any examination malpractices that will take place in your institution, Knec acting CEO Mercy Karogo said.The guidelines add that head teachers, county and subcounty directors of education are jointly accountable for all examination materials.Karogo said, We do not expect candidates to engage in stealing of examinations. Parents and everybody should allow the candidates to score their rightful grades. The credibility and integrity of the exams will be enhanced with a cheating-free process, she added.Even before the examination started, Knec chairman George Magoha on Sunday cautioned candidates against being duped to buy fake KCPE exam papers.A teacher in Migori county was caught selling an English exam paper to a pupil of Rongo Primary School. We wish to notify the public that some of these papers have been sent to the council, which has scrutinised them and found that all of them are fake, Magoha said.In the past, police armouries acted as exam distribution centres where leakages originated.This time round, the government bought and placed 346 containers in all subcounties.The containers are under 24-hour police guard to prevent pilferage.The metal containers have three keys held by the subcounty commissioner and county directors of education to limit contact by the police and other persons.
