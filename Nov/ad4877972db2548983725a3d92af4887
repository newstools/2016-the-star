Politicians found dishing out money in fundraising from next week risk being barred from contesting in 2017 polls as per the enacted Election Act 2011.Some MPs are unhappy with the "controversial and unfair" law banning the harambees eight months to the general elections on grounds it "impedes the spirit of helping" in the country.December 8 marks eight months to next year's August polls and any politician eyeing an elective seat will be held to account including disqualification from contesting when found attending fundraising activities. They include raising money in funerals, churches, schools, weddings, medical fees for the sick and development projects, among others.Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja yesterday criticized the the law and vowed to support any legislator pushing for its amendment in the House."This is an unfair law because it bars politicians who want to help the needy. When a politician helps through harambees it does not mean that people must vote for you or you will automatically be elected. This law goes against the spirit of helping each other," Sakaja said.The law barring harambees eight months to the polls is an election malpractice because it intends to influence voters decision in electing their leader.Ford Kenya leader and Cord co-principal Moses Wetang'ula's was the first senior politician to lose his Bungoma senatorial seat in 2013 when Justice Gikonyo nullified his election citing massive irregularities including claims of dishing out money to voters. Wetang'ula was later won the seat with a landslide in a by-election after defeating his rival Musikari Kombo.Section 67 1(a) of the Elections Act states: A person who commits the offence of personation, treating, undue influence or bribery; commits an offence and is liable on conviction, in the cases specified in paragraph (a), to a fine not exceeding one million shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years or to both, and in any other case, to a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both. National Assembly Deputy Majority Leader Jakoyo Midiwo criticized President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto encouraging harambees in the country instead of laying development projects to benefit all Kenyans."Most of the money given out through harambees are from corruption and there should be total ban to help fight graft in this country," he said.Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale concurred with Midiwo saying the millions of money given in fundraising is looted from taxpayers coffers.He maintained that MPs salaries alone cannot allow them to dish out millions of money in harambees.
