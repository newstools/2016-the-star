Democrat Hillary Clinton has been declared the US President by Kenyans living in Kogelo, Siaya county, which is Barack Obama's village.Residents conducted a mock poll in which Clinton emerged winner after garnering 78 per cent votes against Republican nominee Donald Trump's 22 per cent.Lining up carrying white papers on their hands, the residents enthusiastically cast their votes in two boxes branded with Trump's and Clinton's images.Residents chanted Clinton's name, saying they were supporting US President Barack Obama's choice. They also urged participants not to rig."Do not rig the elections ... No rigging in the polls ... Clinton is winning ... She has to win ... The election is free and fair," they shouted.Read: At long last, Americans decide between Clinton and TrumpKogelo was also hit with the elections fever in November 2012, when residents said they hoped Obama would be re-elected.The village, which is the home of Obama s father, was a beehive of activity as hundreds of visitors camped at the home awaiting the outcome of the vote pitting Obama and Mitt Romney.Read: Anxiety in Kogelo ahead of US pollsAlso read: US election fever grips Obama s Kogelo villageObama has been campaigning with Clinton but his half-brother Malik said he will vote for Trump in the election taking place today.Malik, a US citizen, has lived in Washington since 1985 where he worked with various firms before becoming an independent financial consultant.He said he dislikes Clinton and was unhappy with his brother's leadership.The man who is in his 50s said he supports Trump's policies, especially his focus on security."He appeals to me and I think he is down to earth and he speaks from the heart and he is not trying to be politically correct.
