Veteran politician Jackson Kibor s second wife Josephine will call her co-wife and three witnesses to defend her marriage of 51 years. Kibor filed for divorce, accusing her of desertion and cruelty.Josephine will take the stand today at a court in Eldoret. She says there is no reason to part ways after 51 years. Among the witnesses is Kibor s third wife Naomi Cheptoo, who says they are all happily married. Kibor testified two weeks ago. He said he would not produce any witnesses but later said he might, depending evidence given by his wife s witnesses.Josephine says she has lived in harmony with the 82-year-old politician since they got married. Through lawyer Amos Magut, she has denied all the allegations made by Kibor against her. He has accused Josephine, 67, of interfering with his ownership of 800 acres in Kipkabus, Uasin Gishu, by obtaining a caveat barring him from selling it.Kibor caused laughter in the court when he said Josephine did not bring the land to the marriage and it should not be her concern.Lawyer Magut told the court Josephine had no issues with Kibor. Kibor married his third wife Naomi in 1975 and moved to live with her. In 2002, he married Yunita and moved to live with his latest flame at Kebenes. But he has been making frequent visits to his matrimonial home at Kipkabus and Josephine has thus not deserted the home, he said. But Kibor said he has not spent time with her in 30 years and wants their marriage certificate issued in 1965 cancelled. She does not respect me and has abandoned the farm, causing the death of my livestock and chickens, he said.
