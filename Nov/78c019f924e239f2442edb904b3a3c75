A woman who was beaten and burnt by a mob in Uplands village, Lari, on Friday died at the Kenyatta National Hospital at the weekend.Residents said Esther Wanjiku, 34, threatened to deal with anyone who raised the alarm over her missing son Ian Kamau. This led to her arrest. She was charged in a Limuru court with child neglect and released on Sh5,000 bond. The child has not been found. Resident Betty Wanja said when Wanjiku was released she started issuing death threats. She said she knew those behind her arrest and would deal with them, Wanja said. Resident Doris Muthoni said those she threatened decided to act before she attacked them.Last week Wanjiku told senior principal magistrate Godfrey Oduor she was gang raped by street boys on Murang a Road, Nairobi, and her son fled in fear.
