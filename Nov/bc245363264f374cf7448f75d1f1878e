These leaders allowed Jubilee party to misuse them without knowing. Let them carry their own crosses because the party cannot continue accommodating its enemies, he said.He added during a talk show on Ramogi FM on Wednesday that they were given enough time to explain their disloyalty before they were expelled. Those who explained themselves well were absolved from wrongdoing while some decided to return out of will, he said.Mbadi asked ODM supporters to apply for ID cards and resgister to vote. Our supporters should know Kenyans have lost faith in the Jubilee administration. The only way is to kick it out of power is to vote strongly against it, he said.But some of the expelled leaders have said they will challenge the decision in court. I will seek an interpretation of the Political Parties Act that is denying me my freedom of association," said Kisii Governor Joash Maangi."No one should restrict or victimise me for working with the government as I seek development."Read: Ababu, Mvurya among 10 rebels expelled from ODMAlso read: ODM rebels dare party to field leaders against them
