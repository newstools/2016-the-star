Kenyans with ideas to reduce maternal and child deaths can access a Sh700 million fund for Africa.The Grand Challenges Africa Grant will give up to Sh10 million seed grants for two years. Innovations which show promise for scaling up will be eligible to apply for additional funding of up to Sh100 million. Up to 40 projects will be funded over the next five years that the scheme will run, Tom Kariuki, head of the Nairobi-based Nepad Agency s Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa, said.The organisation runs the programme together with the African Academy of Sciences.The grant has been given by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We are seeking bold new ideas with potential for enormous impact in Africa, so mothers and children not only survive, but thrive, Kariuki said. He said the first call for proposals that opened last week will seek to help Africa meet the SDG Three target for maternal, newborn and child health.The fund is open to any innovator living in Africa with any level of experience, working in any discipline in colleges, universities, government laboratories, research institutions, non-governmental and non-profit organisations.Judges will be looking for new technologies that identify causes of poor outcomes in pregnancy, birth and in the first month of life.Other successful innovators would need to come up with precision medicine approaches and techniques to identify microbes and other exposures in Africa that may increase susceptibility to noncommunicable diseases, including cancer and heart diseases in mothers and children under five years of age.Creative approaches to increase investment in African research will also be funded.
