Introduction of new duties and levies on imports and exports has slowed down containerised trade along the East Africa s Northern corridor, a trade report by shipping giant Maersk Group states.The report shows the northern corridor comprising Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and parts of Rwanda recorded a three per cent growth in exports, while imports rose two per cent year-on-year in September.The drop in trade was propelled by a 13 per cent and 9 per cent decline in exports and imports respectively, along the Central Corridor (Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Malawi, DRC and parts of Rwanda).The sharp decline in imports and exports on the central corridor was largely fuelled by the fall in commodity prices. Also the fact that containerised volumes from neighbouring countries, including Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo, which used to pass through the Dar es Salaam port, moved out via other gateway ports like Durban in South Africa and Walvis Bay in Namibia, Maersk line Eastern Africa trade manager Chukwuma Mokwe said. The report indicates export growth was largely driven by tea, whose shipments grew by 43 per cent in the first nine months, helped by a slight weakening of the shilling against the US dollar. Other flourishing exports were non-frozen vegetables, beans, avocadoes and animal fodder. The 34 per cent rise in Kenya s avocado exports, the report suggests, was due to the use of controlled atmosphere containers, which increased their global reach. Maersk Line Eastern Africa managing director Steve Felder said that trade in the region is likely to be hurt by political instability, rising inflation, volatile commodity prices, generally weak currencies and a slow down in commodity demand in China. To improve trade volumes in our region, the East African economies need to attract more foreign investments, which can only happen if we continue to work towards removing trade barriers and providing a conducive environment for business in general, and industrialization specifically, Felder said.
