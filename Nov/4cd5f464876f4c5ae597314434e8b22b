Whether held on August 8, some time in December 2017 or even in late March 2018, Kenya&rsquo;s next general election must be free, fair and genuinely credible.Anything less would plunge the country back into the dark days of post-election violence that followed the botched 2007 polls.Since January, all attention has been focused on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Electoral reforms have been distilled into merely changing the line-up of IEBC commissioners, starting with the chairman, which nearly all stakeholders have agreed is a prerequisite for the holding of a peaceful election next year.Attention is not being paid to the myriad government entities completely outside IEBC control or even influence, whose conduct or failure will endanger the credibility of the polls. It will obviously increase the likelihood of generalised violence and social disorder, particularly just after Election Day.I believe it is necessary to &ldquo;troubleshoot&rdquo; all the risks posed by failures on the part of various state actors, immediately publicise the specific details of identified problems and also recommend practical common sense solutions and quick fixes. This should be a continuous exercise and needs to start as soon as possibleSome of the examples of threats and risk factors provided to illustrate the scope of our problems are that one, the ministry of Foreign Affairs has failed to fund facilities overseas to facilitate registration of Kenyans living abroad. Second, the National Police Service is unable to maintain law and order before, during and after the elections and third, the Interior ministry is unable to issue ID cards to all eligible voters.Until October, the Judicial Service Commission had not filled the positions left vacant by the retirement of former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, Deputy Chief Justice Kalpana Rawal and Supreme Court Judge Philip Tunoi. In fact, it had to be decided by the Supreme Court on the very last days &mdash; before Mutunga retired &mdash; that Rawal and Tunoi had to retire at 70 years, not 74 as they argued.These developments posed a crisis at the highest court in Kenya that has the jurisdiction to decide on election petitions, particularly the presidential outcome.Treasury also fails to budget in advance for the cost of a runoff in the presidential election.Although not an exhaustive list of all potential problems that could derail peaceful and credible elections, there is a common denominator to these and other easily determined issues: Another state actor can be blamed by the IEBC for the consequences of foreseeable failures that need not have occurred.From December 2011 onwards, I very publicly asserted that Kenya would not hold its lawfully mandated elections at any time in 2012: The election date was eventually fixed for March 4, 2013. Many of the factors I identified in 2011 are still with us and there are now new threats posed by state actors&rsquo; failures.The sooner we examine the world beyond the IEBC, the sooner we can cost-effectively fix problems or mitigate their negative consequences.We may soon realise that holding elections on August 8, 2017 is simply not possible under all of the circumstances besetting the nation.The early recognition of this reality on the part of all stakeholders and adjusting the election schedule accordingly is a basic requirement of leadership.
