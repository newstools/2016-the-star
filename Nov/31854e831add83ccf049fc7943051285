Mandera county has mapped out water resources to end perennial shortages that have triggered conflicts.Water chief officer Habiba Ragow said the satellite mapping will help identify the county s waterpoints. She spoke on Wednesday during Kenya Water Week at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.Ragow said the county has allocated more than Sh5 billion since 2013 for water projects to improve supply.The conflicts have also been fuelled by the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.Ragow said inter-clan conflicts, in particular among the Degodia and Garre communities, are mainly over water and pasture.She said several boreholes have been drilled and many people can now access water. As a result, conflicts arising from lack of water and pasture have declined.The county government has initiated water projects at Darwet, Lagwarera and Falama-Elwak.Ragow said more projects will be rolled out by the government soon.She said the first satellite mapping documented points where there are water resources.Ragow said waterborne diseases have declined because of improved access to clean water and promotion of hand washing in schools. She said several schools now have piped water, which has increased enrollment and retention.Schools that have benefited from piped water include Afalo and Kamorele primary schools. Ragow said the county government has drilled fresh water boreholes for Sh130 million in Darwet, now supplying 30,000 litres per hour in four centres.County water director Mohamed Ali said supply has increased from 53 per cent to 65 per cent as a result of devolution.
