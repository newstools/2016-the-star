It is now in the public domain that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is unhappy with Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama and a few of his supporters.This was affirmed on Friday at Sultan Hamud when Kalonzo publicly gave Muthama a dress down accusing him of causing political division in the region.Muthama had warned Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana (who was not present at the rally) of a fierce political battle if he does not fold up his Muungano Party to Join Wiper.The remarks did not go down well with Kalonzo who immediately took Muthama head-on, accusing him of using wrong language to woo the party s support."However much we want to be in one party, I disagree with Muthama in the manner of approach. We need to bring them to Wiper in a polite manner and not in the robust way of attacks, said Kalonzo.He said that his presidential bid needed the support of all and therefore it will be detrimental to continue causing more division in the region by engaging in minor political wars.However word has it that the Kalonzo Muthama public slur on Friday has more than meets the eye.Close allies of Kalonzo says that the Kamba political kingpin has been so patient with Muthama for a long time but not this time round.One of Kalonzo's confidants, who asked not to be named, said that Kalonzo is bitter that Muthama has already identified his own candidates who he has been assuring of direct nominations.This is despite the party s public assurance that the nomination exercise will be free and fair."Kalonzo is bitter that despite his efforts to try and redeem the party s image from the 2013 nominations, he has learned that Muthama has been calling to intimidate some aspirants asking them to drop their candidature since they will not get the nomination certificate," the source said.Muthama has always been accused by a majority of the 2013 Wiper defectors that he was the reason behind the loss of some assured Wiper parliamentary and ward seats in the region, more so in Machakos county.The wiper leader is also said to be bitter with Muthama for doing very little to push for a Kalonzo candidature in the Cord coalition despite having appointed him to chair the coalition's affairs together with Siaya senator James Orengo.Sources say that Kalonzo has already learned that Muthama has been working behind his back to scuttle his endorsement by the Cord coalition.Muthama is also said not having been paying party dues despite claiming to be a Kalonzo number one supporter. He is reported to owe the party in millions of accrued dues.However Muthama s supporters took to the social media over the weekend to protest the public lecture Kalonzo gave to Muthama.In a WhatsApp group named Kiamba diehards, Muthama s sympathizers were out to prove their loyalty to Muthama by all means."What is so hard in folding up all these small parties and having Wiper as the main Ukambani Party?? Kama Karua (Martha) with all her high hardness has chosen to support Uhuru, why can t we learn? This Madoadoa is what makes us loose our bargaining power," wrote Irene Mulu.Others went on to accuse Kalonzo of being too soft in politics."Everybody in Kenya knows who Kiamba is. Kalonzo is our leader but he is soft in politics. Mpaka ukae ngumu kama Muthama. Ukambani Kama mnataka tuheshimiwe na wale wengine tuachane na CCU, Muungano na hizi cahama dogo dogo na tukae Wiper. If you support Kalonzo join Wiper la sivyo potelea mbali (You must be tough like Muthama for us to be respected as Kambas...we have to drop these small parties such as CCU, Muungano and be firm in Wiper...)," Januaris Ngoka said.Read: Lease BVR Kits to save cash, Kalonzo tells government
