The Kenya Pipeline Company has refuted claims that half of refuelling hydrant pit valves at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport have malfunctioned.This is in the wake of increased concerns, including an internal email communication indicating the country s main airport is facing a crisis on refueling of aircrafts over stalled valves which need urgent replacement.In a public notice on Friday, the KPC management said 95 per cent of the hydrant pit valves at the JKIA are functional. It has been reported that of the 130 valves installed, 60 have malfunctioned thereby leading to speculations that JKIA may have to close due to a lack of refueling capabilities.This information in incorrect and the fears that it has given rise to are unnecessary , the notice signed finance manager Samuel Odoyo reads.The company however confirmed there are six valves that are out of service. JKIA s apron has a total of 128 hydrant pit valves. Out of these, 122 are operational, while six are currently not in service and need replacement .A related and relevant fact is that 43 of the 128 HPVs are earlier generation models, it said.The management said the company sought to replace the old valves in 2014 in order to comply with the requirements of the Joint Inspection Group , the global organisation that certifies jet fuel quality.The process however stalled after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission raised questions over the procurement process of the equipment. The HPVs were duly delivered but could not be released for use because the procurement process for the valves became subject of investigation. These investigations are yet to be concluded, Odoyo said.He said the board has however approved acquisition of 10HPVs, to replace the six non-functioning ones, while four will be spares. The procurement process is underway, he said Of the 128 HPVs at JKIA, 122 (95 per cent) are functional, and shortly all 128 will be in operation. JKIA has sufficient capability, as it always has had to refuel all aircrafts using the airport, the notice reads.The hydrant pit valves are procured, installed and maintained by the sole jet fuel supplier to JKIA Kenya Pipeline Company according to an arrangement entered into with the Kenya Airports.The valves are used to refuel international and local aircraft landing at JKIA.The breakdown of the valves has recently affected many airplanes including President Uhuru Kenyatta s plane which was towed from the Presidential Pavilion to an alternative refuelling point before being towed back for departure.KPC managing director Joe Sang said his team is addressing the crisis.The pit valves were supplied by a local company Aero Dispenser Valves Ltd at Sh600 million.
