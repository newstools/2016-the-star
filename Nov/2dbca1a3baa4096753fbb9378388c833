Fast-rising Kenyan dancehall artiste Junior Rebel aka JR is sensationally becoming a champion for peace.The singer says that music, being a powerful tool that transcends beyond ages, boundaries and races, is best suited in spreading his messages of peace.JR points that the world in general is in dire straits and that only peace can conquer.&quot;With everything that&#39;s going on in the world, I felt that it was my responsibility to pass this message. A message of peace and tranquility.&quot;We always seem to take sides, but the biggest question is; who are we fighting for?&quot; he poses.Through his latest release titled Who Are We Fighting For?, JR is &quot;crying out&quot; for world peace, unity and love amongst the people.He adds, &quot;All over the world, we are witnessing citizens rising up against governments, tribal and racially-instigated wars which always end in bloodshed and loss of lives.&quot;Why are we fighting? Who or what are we fighting for? Peace is the only solution. And that&#39;s my message to the people.&quot;JR is one of the artistes sponsored by TurningTables, who empower marginalised youth globally by providing them with the means to express their grievances, hopes and dreams in music and film.He has worked on a few collaborations with Wyre, Juliani and hip hop artiste Oksyde.Watch his new video below.&nbsp;
