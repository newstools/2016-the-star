The Ministry of Sports will meet the striking Kenya Sevens rugby players on Monday as the row over bonuses escalated yesterday.Permanent Secretary of Sports Ambassador Richard Ekai met Kenya Rugby Union chairman Richard Omwela, acting Chief Executive Officer Thomas Odundo, and Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde in his office to try and end the tension created by the striking players.A source who attended the meeting disclosed Ekai came with notes from a meeting the squad had with President Uhuru Kenyatta after the Singapore World Series leg win in April where former coach Benjamin Ayimba informed President Kenyatta former sponsor Kenya Airways had slashed salaries and and that bonuses had not been factored in the new contracts for the 2015-2016 season.Ayimba had revealed to the President it would take Sh44 million to cater for the team bonuses and salaries for the new season. State House instructed the money be wired to their personal accounts.At the meeting Ekai disclosed the Kenya Sevens players were paid Sh41 million.Ekai said he will bring the list of how much each player received from the government. The government officer wondered why the players had opted to go on strike yet they were compensated handsomely by the government. I'm just wondering why they are on strike yet thy were paid well by the government after winning in Singapore he remarked.The Kenya Rugby Union board vice chair Thomas Opiyo and director of squads Oscar Mango are slated to meet the players today as they seek to end the strike with barely a week remaining to the start of the 2016-2017 season in Dubai and Cape Town.When contacted captain Amonde said there were issues to be resolved between the players and the Union. There are some things which we have to sort out. Hopefully by the weekend we can resolve everything, added Amonde.The players have been on strike since Wednesday over bonuses totalling Sh22 million from the 2015-2016 season. They have said they will not resume training until the bonuses are paid.The Union made an offer of Sh3 million to the players which the players rejected.The Union were allegedly considering other players outside the ones contracted for the side should the strike persist to next week.
