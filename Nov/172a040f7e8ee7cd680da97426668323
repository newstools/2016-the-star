Media stakeholders have set up a committee to re-look at media legislation to recommend amendments. The stakeholders discussed laws they said infringe on free media.Media Council chairman Charles Kerich said recommendations would be passed on to the government through the Ministry of Information that will ask Parliament to amend the offending clauses. As media practitioners, we are opposed to a proposal to delink the Complaints Commission from the Council. We express displeasure at the speed in which cases were being arbitrated by the Commission, which is yet to begin work due to contestation over the right composition, he said. Kerich was with MCK chief executive Haron Mwangi and Kenya Union of Journalist secretary general Eric Odour on Saturday during a two-day retreat to deliberate on the status of journalism and preparations to adequately cover the 2017 elections.
