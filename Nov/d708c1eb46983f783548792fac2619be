The standard gauge railway will cause irreparable damage to the Nairobi National Park, environment professor John Musingi has said.He said the state proposal to have it bisect the park will cause habitat fragmentation and lead to inbreeding and ecosystem imbalance.Musingi spoke at a stakeholders meeting to analyse an environmental and social impact assessment study done last month. Participants said they will oppose any proposals to have the SGR pass through the park. They urged the government to reroute it.Sara Munguti of Nature Kenya said giving options that only cut through the park is part of conmanship aimed at blocking debate on alternative routes. We are being herded like wildebeests to one crossing point, as if there no options, she said.
