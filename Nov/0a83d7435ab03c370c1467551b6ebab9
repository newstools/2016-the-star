Nema has accused Nairobi politicians of contributing towards the pollution of the River Athi. The authority said the politicians encourage illegal settlement and encroachment on the river basin.&ldquo;It has become very difficult to move along the river to assess the rate of pollution due to illegal dwellers, who have even built toilets on the river banks. Whenever we try to demolish the structures, politicians, especially MCAs from Nairobi county, defend them,&rdquo; Nema deputy director Robert Orina said on Friday.He spoke in Kabaa and Miondoni, Yatta constituency, during a visit by the Parliamentary Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.But Kitui East MP Marcus Muluvi said government agencies tasked with preventing pollution on the river have failed.Farmer Joseph Nduva said their vegetables are rejected at the export market &ldquo;... on the grounds they are unfit for human consumption.&rdquo; He said residents contract water-borne diseases. The committee&rsquo;s report will be debated in February.
