The High Court has ordered Interior PS Karanja Kibicho to appear on Tuesday over his failure to obey previous orders in a compensation case for a torture victim.Kibisho was expected in court on Monday but made no appearance.Justice George Odunga ordered the Inspector General of Police to personally execute a warrant of arrest against the PS.He said the OCPD at Central police failed to apprehend Kibicho as ordered on October 13.This is after Kibicho failed to obey an order issued on December 5, 2015 requiring him to pay Sh2,647,019 to a Nyayo House torture victim.The judgement to pay Michael Mahugu was issued on February 11, 2014.Through his lawyer Kinuthia Wandaka, Mahugu lodged a petition in the High Court in 2003 seeking compensation for damages from the government through the Attorney General.Mahugu told the court that he was tortured by Special Branch Officers at Nyayo House, and later at Kenya Prison in 1987.Mahugu's unsuccessful attempts at receiving payment saw him file an application compelling the PS to comply with the judgement.
