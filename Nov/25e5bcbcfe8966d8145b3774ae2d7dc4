A new report by the Auditor General details massive misuse and theft of public funds in the 47 county governments.For instance, the Homa Bay county government failed to account for millions of shillings for the construction of changing rooms and VIP toilets at the Homa Bay Stadium, work that was never done.This bizarre case mirrors dozens of other instances of misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance and outright theft throughout Kenya. Billions of shillings are being lost in a plague of lawlessness.Meanwhile, both the government and the opposition are locked in a juvenile contest about who is more corrupt. The opposition is fixated by corruption in the national government, uttering not even a whimper about the rampant graft in the counties that its governors control. The government is paralysed by nonfeasance, a failure to act when under an obligation to do so.The corruption monitoring NGOs are clustered in the leafy suburbs of the capital city, instead of devolving to the mashinani and raising the alarm there.
