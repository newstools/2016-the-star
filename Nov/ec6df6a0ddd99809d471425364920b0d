Nakuru county assembly speaker Susan Kihika&rsquo;s Senate bid received a boost after her family vowed to end their feud and support her ambitions.The five wives of former Nakuru politician Dixon Kihika have been at loggerheads with Kihika, their stepdaughter, over their husband&rsquo;s estate. However, they said they have reconciled and blessed Susan.The move on Saturday followed the speaker&rsquo;s appointment to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s national presidential campaign team. She will be in charge of Baringo, Laikipia and Nakuru counties.Nine MPs and more than 50 MCAs from the county have rallied behind Kihika&rsquo;s appointment and promised to support her. In January, the widows had quarreled when seven of them accused Susan of conspiring to acquire her father&rsquo;s property illegally.On Saturday, widows Nyambura Kihika, Alice Kihika, Lucy Wangari, Jane Wanjiru, Miriam Warau, Charity Nyambura, Margaret Wambui and Winnie Wanjeri reconciled, 12 years after their husband&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;We have agreed to sort out differences amicably for the sake of the Kihika family. We don&rsquo;t want to paint a bad picture to Uhuru after he appointed Susan,&rdquo; Margaret, 85, said.She accused individual politicians of fueling the feud for political mileage. The widows, who have 48 children, apologised to Susan and said as mothers who believe in Kikuyu traditions, it would be wrong for them not to bless her when she has been charged with great responsibility by the head of state.
