Murang a residents could be the biggest beneficiaries of the controversial Northern Collector Tunnel.Documents show the government has initiated 10 projects for Sh4.1 billion to supply the entire county with water for domestic use and put up sewerage plants.Part of that expense is covered by the Sh6.8 billion total cost of the entire tunnel. Murang a leaders, led by Senator Kembi Gitura and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau, vehemently opposed the tunnel last year, but say they now support it wholeheartedly.Opposition leader Raila Odinga said it will suck the county dry and turn it into a desert. Some professionals last week backed Raila s assertions. The main project involves obstructing water flow from three rivers near the Aberdares Forest and tunneling it to Ndakaini Dam in Thika for onward distribution to Nairobi.Project documents show the tunnel s financing would also cover some of the 10 Murang a county projects, which benefit all the 950,000 residents. Three of those projects are complete and operational, but have not been officially commissioned.The complete projects are the Sh917 million Kandara Bulk Water Supply Project, Sh617 Murang a Urban Bulk Water Supply Project, and Rehabilitation and Expansion of Murang a Town Sewerage Project for Sh171 million.
