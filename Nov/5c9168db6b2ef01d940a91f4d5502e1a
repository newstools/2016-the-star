Cord leader Raila Odinga will hold grassroots meetings to woo the Kalenjin community in the backyard of Deputy President William Ruto.His 2017 election strategy to meet residents directly apparently was chosen because Raila does not have strong allies in the region, a Jubilee stronghold. This week, the ODM chief Raila held meetings in Uasin Gishu and Marakwet counties and was made an elder during a rally in Karuna Meibeki grounds in Moiben town. We got a very positive reception and we will have more grassroots meetings in the region as we approach the 2017 election, ODM devolution secretary Kipkorir Menjo said on Thursday. Last month, Raila visited Segero village in Uasin Gishu county. MCA Josphat Lowoi dismissed the trip, saying it would not change the region s allegiance to Jubilee. We are a democratic county and we welcome all aspirants and leaders to seek votes, but our people know very well where they belong, he said. Raila urged the Kalenjin community to help him remove Jubilee from power because it has caused suffering to most Kenyans including those who voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto. ODM is scouting for aspirants to run for governor in the Rift. Raila has planned rallies in Eldoret, Kitale, Iten and Kapsabet. We have planned a lengthy week-long tour for Cord and the dates will be confirmed soon, Menjo said. He said meetings in villages will be used to build up momentum for the main rallies.
