Two Senators and an MP have backed President Uhuru Kenyatta s decision to withdraw Kenyan troops from the United Nations mission in South Sudan.They said it was unfair of UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon to discriminate against Lieutenant General Johnson Ondieki."Ondieki is not to blame for the violence that let to the killing of dozens of people in the country," Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong'i said on Sunday.Kisii Senator Chris Obure said the withdrawal was necessary, adding that Kenyan troops on peace keeping missions must be respected."We fully support the President's decision," he said.Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi said it was unfair for the UN to attribute its problems to an individual, adding that they should look for better ways to solve the crisis.Last week, the UN chief called Ondieki's replacement as head of UNMISS saying the mission failed to respond to violence during recent clashes in Juba.The government responded by ordering the immediate withdrawal of troops from South Sudan and disengagement from the peace process.Uhuru also said Kenya would stop its contribution to the proposed Regional Protection Force.More on this: Furious Kenya pulls troops from South SudanKenya has more than 1,000 soldiers deployed in South Sudan.
