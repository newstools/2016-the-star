Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu feels they still need to do a lot ahead of the World Sevens Series opener in Dubai in a fortnight.Kenyans are fresh from finishing second at the Safland Sevens after losing out to South African 31-10 over the weekend. Simiyu said the next two weeks will be used to polish up the mistakes which were evident during the tournament and also sharpen up the team&rsquo;s strength and conditioning.&ldquo;The trip was very good. We were in Namibia for a week and we really pushed the players in the high performance camp and then we had the test over the weekend and the boys responded well. So far, they have met our expectations as per where we think they should be but there is still more to be done and I hope we can try and catch up by the time we go to Dubai,&rdquo; added Simiyu.The two teams met twice during he tournament with Kenya losing the pool stage match 22-0 and Simiyu attributed the loss to fielding a young side.&ldquo;In the first game against South Africa, we fielded a young side so that everyone can get a feel of the Tests. We also wanted to gauge ourselves because there is no doubt South Africa are the best in Africa. As you know they won the bronze at the Olympics so we wanted to see how they play with our young boys,&rdquo; said Simiyu.On the Dubai draw, where Kenya face France, Australia and Japan, he said: &ldquo;We are up for the challenge and we should be in a strong position to challenge and get out of the pool. Of course there are a few things we need to work on,&rdquo; he saidThe final 12-man squad, which will represent the country in Dubai and Cape Town will be named on November 24 and the team is expected to depart on November 27th After the Dubai leg, the team will head to Cape Town for the second event in the 10-leg series on December 10-11. The team will resume training on Monday.Elsewhere, the Kenya Rugby Union recently hosted a series of training courses in Tharaka Niithi and Nanyuki as well as the Kenyatta University.
