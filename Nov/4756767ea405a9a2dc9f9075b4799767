A JKUAT lecturer is the ninth entrant into the race for North Mugirango MP.On Monday, Kepha Keengwe said, &ldquo;I have been doing my ground work and I now confirm that I&rsquo;m in the race.&rdquo;Nine people have declared interest in the seat held by ODM&rsquo;s Charles Geni. They include Nyamira speaker Joash Nyamoko, former MP Wilfred Ombui, Kisii county secretary Johnstone Ndege, Henry Nyankabaria, Jason Mosinga, Shem Tai, Nyaega Ouru and George Onsongo.Former MP and East Africa Legislative Assembly member Joseph Kiangoi will run for senator on the Jubilee Party ticket.Political analysts say Geni and Nyamoko are the strongest contenders. The two hail from Nyamusi and Ekerenyo wards respectively. Both have been endorsed by elders.Nyamoko was on Saturday named as part of the team to campaign for Jubilee in Nyamira county.Keengwe said the competition is not a two-horse race. &ldquo;It is wrong to claim the incumbent and speaker are front runners. When the seat is declared vacant, we all become equal competitors. The two have failed in their role as MP and speaker,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If elected, my focus will be to improve governance and education standards.&rdquo;Geni told the Star he is confident he will reclaim his seat and dismissed some aspirants as nonstarters.&ldquo;I will deliver this seat for ODM. I will bank on my development record to win my second term,&rdquo; he said.Jubilee picked former Constitution Implementation Commission chairman Charles Nyachae as part of the team to lead campaigns in Kisii county.
