The Jubilee government is plotting to postpone the election, Amani leader Musalia has said.&ldquo;There is no doubt there is something fishy going on, especially given the manner in which commissioners for the electoral agency were selected,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi spoke during a funds drive in Lwandanyi, Bungoma county, on Saturday. The recruitment of a new electoral commission boss has been stopped temporarily after the EACC failed to clear the five shortlisted candidates.Mudavadi said the selection panel owes Kenyans an explanation on what the EACC&rsquo;s role is in stopping interviews for shortlisted chairpersons.Mudavadi said the procedure used to select the team was flawed. He said, &ldquo;This is the start of rigging the election.&rdquo; Mudavadi said the selection panel should have sought concurrent clearance from the KRA, EACC and DCI before announcing the shortlist. &ldquo;If indeed only one candidate was found suitable, why not subject the person to an interview before readvertising?&rdquo; he saidMudavdi urged the selection panel to come clean on whether it is working under duress or &ldquo;at the behest of external forces&rdquo;.
