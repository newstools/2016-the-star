The Jubilee government is plotting to postpone the election, Amani leader Musalia has said. There is no doubt there is something fishy going on, especially given the manner in which commissioners for the electoral agency were selected, he said.Mudavadi spoke during a funds drive in Lwandanyi, Bungoma county, on Saturday. The recruitment of a new electoral commission boss has been stopped temporarily after the EACC failed to clear the five shortlisted candidates.Mudavadi said the selection panel owes Kenyans an explanation on what the EACC s role is in stopping interviews for shortlisted chairpersons.Mudavadi said the procedure used to select the team was flawed. He said, This is the start of rigging the election. Mudavadi said the selection panel should have sought concurrent clearance from the KRA, EACC and DCI before announcing the shortlist. If indeed only one candidate was found suitable, why not subject the person to an interview before readvertising? he saidMudavdi urged the selection panel to come clean on whether it is working under duress or at the behest of external forces .
