DP William Ruto has been linked to the rebellion in Ford Kenya, as a faction of the opposition party seeks to remove Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula from the helm.Wetang ula s faction named him the presidential flagbearer on Saturday.Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi yesterday said Trans Nzoia Senate aspirant Ken Wafula has been receiving money from Ruto via allies to finance activities to destabilise Ford Kenya. We have information he has been receiving money from Ruto to fight Wetang ula, but that will not work, he told the Star on the phone.Wafula denied the claims, saying he doesn t need money to fight for democracy and rights of party members. They have linked me to Ruto and so many other people. However, that is escapist. Let them tackle problems in Ford Kenya, he said.Meanwhile, Nairobi Ford Kenya branch chairman Lupesia Komesa recorded a police statement, claiming he was abducted and tortured on Saturday for opposing Wetang ula s party faction at the Bomas of Kenya.He said he was rescued by police at Bomas, where he had been driven after being kidnapped in Thika by goons. He said Wanyonyi was among them.Wanyonyi denied the allegations, but told the Star on the phone he was in Thika to see what was happening at the parallel meeting. He said he only saw some youths take away Komesa to save him from angry party supporters.Komesa said he sustained injuries to his arms and private parts. He said he was in Thika to attend a rival Ford Kenya NDC but was abducted before getting to the Birmingham Hotel, the conference venue. Police are investigating. I was abducted by youths and forced into a car where I found the MP and other people. They warned me to cooperate with them or they would kill me, he said. Komesa was treated at Langata Women Hospital and has obtained a P3 Form. He blamed the kidnapping on Wetang ula.
