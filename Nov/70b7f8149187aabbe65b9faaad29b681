Cases of child abuse in Gilgil subcounty are on the rise, with up to three cases being reported weekly, an NGO has said.Democracy and Good Governance group Nakuru branch chairman Moses Gitonga yesterday termed the trend worrying.He cited a case in which a primary school teacher was reported to have beaten a standard six boy under unclear circumstances. &ldquo;The pupil from Nyondia Primary School in Gilgil did not complete his studies last term due to the beating. This is wrong and should not be allowed to happen in a modern society,&rdquo; Gitonga said after a church service.He said some parents allow their children to work as domestic workers especially during the long Christmas holiday. &ldquo;Parents have a role to play in taking care of their children. Do not neglect them. Observe trends,&rdquo; Gitonga said.
