The National Treasury has appointed three internal auditors to conduct a fresh audit at the Health ministry, the Star has established.However, the revelations have sparked fears of a cover-up of the alleged possible fraud of Sh3.2 billion that has turned into a public relations nightmare for the Jubilee administration.President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s sister and cousin are among owners of companies suspected to have irregularly pocketed millions of shillings.Sources said the three auditors reported to the ministry on Thursday last week, with reports that the National Intelligence Service has also been collecting evidence at Afya House.The sources said Bernard Muchere, the internal auditor and a certified fraud examiner who lifted the lid on the suspected fraud, has been left out in the fresh audit.There has been concerted effort to transfer the auditor, who has exposed several scandals in government.Health CS Cleopa Mailu said in a text message he could not talk at the time the Star contacted him.The state has insisted no money was lost and discredited the leaked draft audit as flawed.&ldquo;We have so far been able to establish that all expenditures under the audit report have been accounted for,&rdquo; Mailu said last week, despite the public storm.The CS had announced he would constitute an independent probe by a private firm, but some MPs warned him he would shoulder the cost.The National Assembly and the Senate are also investigating the matter.
