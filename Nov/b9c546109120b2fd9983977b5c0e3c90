Three Jubilee leaders from Baringo county have said Kanu has no place in the Jubilee administration. Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita dismissed claims that Kanu had signed a coalition agreement in 2013 with Jubilee leaders. Kanu is already dead and at no point has it signed an agreement with Jubilee, Mwaita said on Saturday in Kapropita Primary School. He was accompanied by Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi and woman representative Grace Kiptui.
