Ford Kenya party officials and politicians have embarked on a spirited campaign to popularise the party in western ahead of the 2017 poll.Officials led by secretary general Eseli Simiyu and Bungoma county chairman Wafula Wamunyinyi have been traversing parts of the region to woo residents to join the party.Their main aim is to drum up support for party leader Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma Senator) who has declared that he will vie for the presidency.Eseli said on Tuesday that the party will seek to fill the governor, senator, MP and MCA seats in all western counties during the August 8 general election.The party wants to outshine rival New Ford Kenya which dissolved to join Jubilee Party.''We have been selling our policies at the 47 wards in Bungoma and are planning to move to Trans Nzoia, Kakamega, Busia, Vihiga and West Pokot," said Eseli.Wamunyinyi assured party members of free and fair nominations and said they have received a good number of MCAs from other parties.But a faction of Ford Kenya rebels led by Trans Nzoia activist Ken Wafula are planning to oust Wetang'ula at a meeting planned for the end of November in Thika.They have accused the Senator of running the party "like his own house".The group said that for three years, the party has not held a meeting bringing all members together. The rebels also said Wetang'ula endorsed himself as the party leader.Read: Wetang'ula not serious with bid for presidency - Ford Kenya officials But Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa dismissed the allegations by the rebels as "baseless rumors that are being funded by well known sources out to cause havoc and ruin the party".Read: We will not dissolve Ford Kenya for single party under Cord - MPsJubilee a strong opponentFord Kenya will battle it out with Jubilee Party for the support of Western residents.Opinion is divided on whether Jubilee government s development record in the region will be sufficient for winning the support.Some observers feel the development will earn the ruling coalition some votes while others say the region s weak economy will be a none-issue in the polls.Western leaders have condemned Jubilee for ignoring development in the area in recent months, largely because the region voted for the opposition Cord coalition in the last election.But political analyst Martin Oloo told the Star on Wednesday that the voting in Western will not be guided by development or even the runaway corruption in government. Just like the case was in the American polls, people will talk about lack of development and rampant corruption but will soon forget and revert to their clans, tribal enclaves and parties while voting," Oloo said by phone. The community will be left radar-less and divided as usual and the votes will be shared among parties, with Jubilee as the biggest beneficiary. It will not be attractive for other communities to form alliances."Oloo said Jubilee only needs pockets of support because its strongholds are intact. They will convince the voters to vote for them or scatter the votes so they don t count for the opponents, he said.But media analyst Martin Andati said Jubilee will get votes in Bungoma where it has concentrated its development and state appointments.Andati noted the Sh6 billion Pan Paper factory revival plan was a plus for Jubilee and that the coalition has steady the operations of Nzoia Sugar Company.But he said sugar cane farmers in Kakamega are a disappointed lot and will cast a protest vote against the government. The government has pumped Sh 3.2 billion into Mumias Sugar Company but the money goes towards paying salaries and suppliers while farmers are left to continue suffering, he said.Andati was also of the opinion that the Luhya community is at crossroads. He said many politicians have left ODM but have not joined Jubilee as they are awaiting direction, which no leader is giving."Wetang ula seems confused and should he chose to team up with his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka as a third force, the community will be even more confused, he said.He said the community will face the added choices of Wetang'ula, Mudavadi and Jubilee s President Uhuru Kenyatta.Elected leaders from the region, who joined Jubilee a year ago, have said they joined the government for the sake of development.But they have accused the government of ignoring projects stared by the grand coalition government such as the reconstruction of the Kisumu-Kakamega-Webuye highway and Sigalagala-Butere-Sidindi road.
