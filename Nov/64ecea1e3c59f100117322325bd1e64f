The Nairobi Taxi Association has urged the government to resolve issues that pit it against cheap on-site cabs available through apps.In a statement yesterday, its officials led by Kelvin Kemboi said the new cab companies have created unemployment among youth. You can t employ 10,000 and fire about 100,000, Kemboi said.He said the so-called technology companies demand more than youth can afford, including new vehicles, instead of examining the conditions of the vehicles. Kemboi said there is bad blood between the local taxi operators and these on-site drivers. He said the technology-based taxi operators are taking away their source of income.The association said these companies not only exploit their employees but also pose unhealthy competition. Their prices are very low. What our boda boda brothers make for certain trips is equal to what they charge, it said.The association has given the government a one-week ultimatum to intervene, failing which it will act.
