President Uhuru Kenyatta has yet again criticised opposition leaders for "misleading wananchi with retrogressive politics" ahead of the August 2017 election.Uhuru said Kenya will never forge ahead while leaders spread hatred, lies and propaganda about his Jubilee administration."I was shocked to see in the papers today, someone saying Kinyua went (home) because we gave Bungoma county Sh100 million meant for the health sector," he said."I am asking you, my friends, is the money supposed to come to Bungoma hospitals for residents to acquire proper healthcare, or is it supposed to go back to Nairobi?"The Business Daily reported that State House Chief of Staff Joseph Kinyua approved the payment of Sh400 million to Health ministry suppliers.Part of this was Sh100 million to Lamu and Bungoma hospitals each, for upgrades.The newspaper referred to the final interim audit report presented to Parliament. It said the amounts were part of the Sh5.3 billion highlighted in an interim audit report, as an amounts that may have been embezzled.Uhuru said it was sad that the country has elected leaders who have specialised in "making noise" every time the government does something good for the people.Watch: [VIDEO] Raila defends Cord governors, says corruption audit biasedHe addressed a crowd at Kanduyi area in Bungoma town on Thursday when he made a stop on his way to Kibabii University's first graduation ceremony.The President said his government has tried to improve lives since it took over power in 2013, and that most Kenyans can attest to that.Uhuru said they have proof of services offered in the years they have been in power, but that some leaders are consistent nags who might divide the country.''We are surprised because they cannot tell wananchi what they have they done for residents,'' he said."Anyone who cannot see anything good for his country is not supposed to be in the country or alive. It is better someone to say 'we have seen this and want you to improve on this'. That is what is called constructive opposition."The President asked those in the opposition to put their differences aside and work together for the country's good."We as Jubilee want a country where someone should not worry about his tribe, religion or status as long as he is Kenyan. Let us love one another so as to succeed in making our country better,'' he said.He discouraged politics of hatred saying it can only lead to a dead end, and will not help solve Kenya's many problems.Uhuru noted that Bungoma county received a charter for Kibabii University which had been denied for four years.He also said Webuye's Pan Paper factory was being revived, roads constructed and electricity installed in schools and homes.The President promised to pump Sh300 million for the university to complete the construction of buildings.He asked institutions of higher learning across the country and the Education ministry to ensure politicians and those who want to vie for various seats do not acquire certificates without merit.Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, Senator Moses Wetang'ula were among leaders who attended the ceremony.Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the claim against Kinyua was malicious and aimed at portraying him as corrupt.Kiraithe told journalists on Thursday that the newspaper's report did not explain his involvement in the wiring of the funds and how he issued the directions. Having gone through the final report presented to Parliament I can confidently say the Chief of Staff did not authorise any payment, he said.He added that Kinyua, who also serves as Head of Public Service, did not have the mandate to authorise payments on behalf of the Health ministry or any other office."We therefore wish to refute your story indicating that he directed or authorised any expenditure of funds at the ministry," he said.The law says only an accounting officer can authorise payments by a ministry once budget estimates are approved by the National Assembly, Kiraithe further said that his office will send Media Council of Kenya a complaint letter following the claims.He noted Kinyua was free to take any legal action to redress his reputation.
