Acting Nairobi county secretary Robert Ayisi has denied MCAs claims he is in office illegally.Last week, the MCAs threatened to halt county business if Governor Evans Kidero does not sack Ayisi.County assembly minority leader Abdi Guyo tabled a motion last Tuesday saying Ayisi has been working in an acting capacity for too long. Ayisi was appointed in January to take over from Lilian Ndegwa, who was sacked after she was charged with defrauding the county of Sh17 million.In an interview with the Star last Friday, Ayisi said he cannot be confirmed because Ndegwa s case has not been heard. The law still recognises Ndegwa as the substantive county secretary, he said.Sources at City Hall told the Star the MCAs fighting Ayisi has nothing to do with his working in an acting role for too long. The people fighting Ayisi are the corrupt cartels the governor has been trying to dismantle. Ayisi has not been giving them a hearing and that is why they are fighting him, the source said.The county secretary is the head of the Public Service Board. He conveys decisions of the executive to individuals and authorities, including the assembly. His office is the link between the assembly and the executive.Last week, Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa defended Ayisi and warned Kidero against sacking the CS.Aladwa said the city boss will be committing political suicide if he bows to MCAs pressure. If they remove Ayisi from the seat, it would not be business as usual. It will jeopardise our community voting come 2017, he said.Aladwa also hit out at Guyo saying the minority leader is mischievous and disrespectful to Kidero, the Constitution and residents.He accused Guyo of attacking the Luhya community.
