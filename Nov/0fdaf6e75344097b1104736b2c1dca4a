More than 1.5 million people living with disability have been urged to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta. David ole Sankok (pictured) said people living with disability have been exempted from paying taxes and senior government officials attend their meetings. He is the chairman of the National Council of People Living with Disability. We have 94 MCAs representing people living with disability across the country. MCAs normally pay taxes amounting to Sh100,000. Those with disability don t pay taxes, meaning Sh100,000 for each of the 94 MCAs, Sankok said. This translates to about Sh90 million in a single month and that is the amount jubilee administration has decided to forego for the benefit of people living with disabilities.
