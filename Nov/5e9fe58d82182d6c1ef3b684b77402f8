The Busia government is building an Intensive Care Unit and High Dependency Unit at a cost of Sh200million.Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa said on Thursday the facilities are almost complete, and patients are expected to use them by end of the year. Equipment has been procured and it will be installed after the building is completed, Wangalwa said. He said the ICU and HDU will bring specialised treatment services closer to residents travelling long distances to seek help in referral hospitals.Wangalwa said the county administration also spent Sh300million to build a drug store and stock it, ending the drug shortage problem.The county also is putting up theatres, laboratories and X-ray centres in selected hospitals.Wangalwa on Thursday said the ongoing infrastructure work aims to improve healthcare and accessibility. In our efforts to beef up our workforce, we have hired 300 healthcare providers to minimise the shortage in hospitals, he said. The county set aside Sh1.2 billion for the health docket for the previous financial year, and the allocation was raised to Sh1.6 billion for 2016-17.He said despite the increase, 60 per cent of the money pays health workers, and only a small percentage is spent on the hospitals infrastructure.Wangalwa said the county has set up satellite blood banks and promoted eligible medics. We have built and operationalised the Kenya Medical Training College with intake in progress, he said. Wangalwa said the national government sends doctors on study leave without consultation, interfering with hospitals operation. In Busia, 18 out of 40 doctors have left to further their studies and the county has had to hire contract medics.
