President Uhuru Kenyatta is guilty of corrupt activities carried out by his administration by virtue of his silence on the matter, Cord leader Raila Odinga has said. Raila claimed Uhuru was protecting criminal business associates, whom he did not name, and had reached the end of his ability to fight corruption. He said the businessmen were working with government officials to steal billions of shillings meant for projects that touch on society&#39;s &quot;very survival&quot;. &ldquo;In the President&#39;s own language, there is a saying that there is no difference between a thief and an observer; both are equally guilty,&rdquo; he said. The opposition leader further said&nbsp;in Mombasa on Wednesday that the President should tell the people if he will strengthen the anti-graft war or if they should expect the worst. But he noted that &quot;neither of these possibilities is helpful to Kenyans&quot; and that Uhuru should come up with workable solutions to end the vice that continues to haunt the country. Uhuru scolded government officials over rampant corruption in an address in October, saying the situation is frustrating.He told the accountability summit at State House in Nairobi that officials&nbsp;do not want to deal with the issue in courts and the judiciary.&quot; Corruption is frustrating me. The pressure is on me to do something about corruption but my hands are tied,&quot; he said. &quot;Tell me...

But Raila earlier defended Cord governors following Auditor General Edward Ouko&#39;s release of the counties audit report for the 2014/15 financial year. He said &nbsp;propaganda was being directed to Cord counties and that Jubilee&#39;s were yet to be covered.
