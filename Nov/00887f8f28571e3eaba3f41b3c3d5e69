All Public service vehicles must now have anti-rolling bars fitted in their shells to prevent disintegration in case of an accident, the National Transport and Safety Authority has said. This means in case of an accident, vehicles that roll will maintain their shape, keeping passengers who have their safety belts on safe from major injuries.The bars will be placed at the edges of the vehicles &mdash; in front, on the sides and the back. Most vehicles have no anti-rolling bars and are flattened when involved in an accident. NTSA director of motor vehicle inspection Gerald Wangai said the assembly of PSVs does not meet any safety standard. He spoke during a meeting between the NTSA, Kenya Bureau of Standards, Kenya Accreditation Service, Matatu Owners Association, Matatu Welfare Association, among others at the Mombasa Beach Hotel on Tuesday.
