Jubilee Party acting secretary general Veronica Maina (pictured) yesterday said the merger process was successful and protests by some officials from former parties have no legal basis.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Maina said officials of parties that dissolved and were protesting do not have grounds since their parties no longer exist.&ldquo;We followed the correct process, and yes you can go to the court, but how can the court or any institution serve an entity, which does not exist? All member parties dissolved as per the law,&rdquo; she said.Parties whose officials have protested against the merger include Ford People and PNU. All the 12 member parties dissolved to Jubilee Alliance Party during the merger since Jubilee Party had not been registered.The party was later gazetted as Jubilee Party after JAP officials wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties to rename it to a new party.She said the 12 parties that formed Jubilee no longer exist after being deregistered with the office of the Registrar of Political parties.Maina said demands by senior officials of the parties to publish assets and liabilities in the merger instrument was also overruled by the Political Parties Act, which oversaw the merger process.The Political Parties Act demands the new party to inherit all liabilities and assets of the merging party.Maina said the party met all statutory requirements and is now focused on the general election.
