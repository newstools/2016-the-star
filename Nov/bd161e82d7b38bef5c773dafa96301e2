Traders in Malindi want the Kilifi government to speed up completion of the Old Market. The traders say the project has taken too long, forcing them to work in the open and under poor conditions. On Saturday more than 300 traders protested against the three year delay in completion of the market.They said there are plans to allocate stalls to people who did not previously operate in the market.
