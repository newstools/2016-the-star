Fish harvest from the Indian Ocean is set to increase with the launch of a new deep sea fishing vessel by the Mombasa County government.The locally built vessel launched in partnership with KCB Foundation is expected to increase fish producing between to 150,000 and 300,000 metric tonnes annually, from the current average of 9,000 metric tonnes.The vessel launched on Thursday is expected to increase fish harvest in the county to over 40,000 kilograms per month. This is a game-change for Kenya s marine business. Kenya s marine fisheries sector remains artisanal and subsistence due to the lack of large, fully equipped fishing vessels, KCB group director General (Rtd) Joseph Kibwana said.KCB through its social investment arm, the KCB Foundation financed the acquisition of the vessel, through a Sh30 million- zero per cent interest rate loan extended to the County, with fourteen more vessels expected to be commissioned by next year.The vessel comes at a time Kenya is increasingly importing fish from China which grew to Sh1Billion in 2015 from Sh259 million in 2013, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows.Local fishermen only have access to small, non-motorized boats that cannot go further than the reef or approximately five nautical miles. This is despite the fact that under the rules of the Exclusive Economic Zone, Kenya s coastal fishermen are allowed to fish up to 200 nautical miles from the shorelines, said Kibwana.KCB foundation chairperson Catherine Kola said: Kenya is reputed to have some of the best deep-sea fishing spots in the world, and if these spots are exploited well, they can prove beneficial to our economy, Sshe said, noting the vessel will help create 10,000 jobs. There are large stocks of pelagic species such as tuna and tuna-like species, which signals the need to expand fishing capacity in the Exclusive Economic Zone, she added.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said his government remains committed to working with the private sector to mobilize resources to help in scaling up economic activities in the County.
