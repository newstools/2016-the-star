A court in Nairobi yesterday barred Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko from preferring charges against former NYS deputy director Adan Harakhe. While all citizens must safeguard the independence of the Judiciary, the courts must always consider the public interest and avoid delaying cases unnecessarily.Many cases have lasted close to a decade, because the accused seek conservatory orders, constitutional interpretations, and other judicial pronouncements that serve to delay the quick dispensation of justice.Yesterday&rsquo;s ruling came only a day after Chief Justice David Maraga instructed the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division to create a tracking system to monitor the status of corruption cases. This electronic tool, a master cases dataset, will enable the EACC and the DPP to monitor the status of cases by computer.Many corruption suspects employ delaying tactics, stopping their case until several others they file in other courts are first concluded. But, as John Maynard Keynes once said, in the long term we are all dead.
