The latest row at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission concerns an unhappy ballot paper supply bidder who has taken his appeal to the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board.Whereas it is the right of every dissatisfied bidder to seek redress, the 12th General Election is less than a year away. The PPOA must deal with this matter expeditiously and justice needs to be seen to be done. The election timelines are tight and the country is in the mood to decide again. The election is a matter of the highest national interest and concerns all Kenyans. The procurement of election materials and technologies has to be absolutely aboveboard and done in good time, not at the last minute. The election itself has to be of the highest integrity and its results acceptable even to the losers. It has to be the freest, most fair and most transparent general election in Kenyan history. The ball is in the PPOA s court for now.
