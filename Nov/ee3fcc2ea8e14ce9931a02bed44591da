US President Barack Obama said it was important for government investigations to not allow suggestions or innuendo to influence public opinion, in his first comments after the FBI announced new emails possibly related to its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The Democratic president said in a radio interview he did not want to meddle in the process after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it had found a new trove of emails that might pertain to Clinton's use of a private email server for government business while she was secretary of state.FBI Director James Comey said it was unclear whether the emails were significant. His decision to announce the finding upended the presidential campaign 11 days before the November 8 election and drew heavy criticism from Democrats."I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don't operate on innuendo and we don't operate on incomplete information and we don't operate on leaks," Obama told NowThisNews in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.
