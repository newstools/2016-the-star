Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has written to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi asking for a forensic audit into the alleged misappropriation of Sh5.3 billion at the Health ministry.He said it is a serious matter of public concern. Muturi's office received the letter yesterday.&ldquo;This independent audit will assist in unearthing the truth behind the alleged Sh5 billion loss within the ministry,&rdquo; Keter said. He wants the forensic audit done by an independent unit.A leaked internal audit indicates that the Integrated Financial Management System was manipulated to allow for diversion of funds and double payment of goods.Health CS Cleopa Mailu, who has been questioned by the EACC, says no money was lost.
