A section of Rift Valley leaders yesterday told Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to keep off the affairs of Deputy President William Ruto and concentrate on the fight against the illicit drugs business.The more than 20 leaders from Kericho and Bomet counties accused Joho of saying the DP is a land grabber . As the second-in-command in the country s leadership, the DP has the right to tell Kenyans about leaders with questionable education backgrounds like Governor Joho, Belgut MP aspirant Nelson Koech said.They were reacting to an article in which Joho was quoted as having criticised Ruto for referring to him as an academic dwarf . As Rift Valley leaders, we cannot sit back and listen to Governor Joho insult the Deputy President, Koech said.
