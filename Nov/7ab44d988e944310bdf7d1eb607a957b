More than 30 MCA aspirants have petitioned the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate sitting Nyeri reps over misappropriation of funds.The aspirants said they are disturbed by reports that some MCAs have been involved in graft as raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko&rsquo;s report.Led by Njuguna Kawanjiku, they presented the petition to the Central regional director Jackson Mue on Thursday.They urged him to recover all the public money lost.&ldquo;The EACC should move with speed and prosecute the said individuals, mostly two MCAs mentioned since the accusations are criminal in nature,&rdquo; Kawanjiku said.The anti-graft agency was urged to look into how the ward offices were rented and the recruitment of ward staff.Aspirant Amos Muchiri said the MCAs should be surcharged for the allowances drawn in numerous and meaningless travels outside the county.&ldquo;It has been revealed in the Auditor General&rsquo;s report that the assembly and the MCAs can&rsquo;t account for or have misappropriated Sh146 million in 2014-15yet they are the ones supposed to do general oversight, which puts their credibility at stake,&rdquo; he said.Mue promised to investigate the allegations and make recommendations to ensure money lost is recovered if there is evidence. The Auditor Generals report also demanded the recovery of Sh100 million spent on Karatina and Chinga ward offices, which are dormant.In Chinga ward in Othaya, the auditor did not locate the office paid for yet the secretary, messenger and a watchman yet they received salaries of more than Sh50, 000 per month.In Karatina ward, the messenger and the secretary worked on alternate days.
