Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday questioned the process of auditing the public accounts by Auditor General Edward Ouko, which he termed "unethical".He said the way they the office of Auditor General approaches audits is "like looking for mistakes". Oparanya has served as an auditor for 15 years.&ldquo;If you hear that money has been spent on a project and documents are not available, you must carry out what is called an alternative auditing,&rdquo; he said.
