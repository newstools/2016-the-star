The World Anti-Doping Agency and its head Craig Reedie faced stinging criticism from national Olympic committees on Wednesday for its handling of the Russian doping scandal, days before its board meeting where the Scot is up for re-election.Reedie, speaking to the general assembly of the Association of National Olympic committees (ANOC), said these were &ldquo;troubled times&rdquo; after the Russian doping affair, which resulted in dozens of athletes being banned from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.While calling for more sanctioning powers for WADA and closer cooperation with governments, Reedie, who is up for re-election on Nov. 20, had to defend his organisation&rsquo;s actions with half a dozen NOCs criticising him at the assembly.He also had to defend the timing of the release of part of the so-called McLaren report into doping in Russia shortly before the Rio Games in August.The report uncovered systematic state- sponsored doping in Russia.The investigation, triggered by media reports of state-backed doping in Russia, led to a partial ban on Russians at the Rio Games and the suspension of the country&rsquo;s doping laboratory, its anti-doping agency and athletics federation.
