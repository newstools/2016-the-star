Traders who sell their wares outside the Polish Embassy and next to Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama's residence in Gigiri on Thursday held protests after they were evicted from the area.The traders accused the senator of being behind the move to have them evicted from the Redhill and Limuru roads roundabout, where they used to sell furniture, wood carvings, flowers and flower pots.Muthama owns the building that houses the embassy and several prime properties in the area."Senator Muthama should simply go back to Machakos. We do not need him in Nairobi because he has destroyed our livelihoods. We are small-scale traders, who are here to earn a living and we know very well the road is not even being repaired. He wants to plant flowers in these open spaces outside his premises," trader Mwangi Gituku said.They carried placards and twigs during the protests.They blocked part of Redhill Road, causing a traffic snarl-up.Efforts to get a comment from Senator Muthama were unsuccessful as he did not answer calls or reply to text messages.Speaking to the Star in 2010 when the Star paid him a courtesy call in his Gigiri residence, Muthama said there is need to protect lives by erecting barriers on the road bordering his prime properties."I have taken the initiative to beautify the roundabout and put up barriers so that if vehicles veer off the road, they do not knock down pedestrians," he said then.
