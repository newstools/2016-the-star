Former NYS Senior officials Adan Harakhe and Hassan Noor were yesterday ordered to pay Sh1 million each bail to secure their freedom pending trial over the NYS scam.Harakhe was the NYS deputy director general while Noor chaired the Ministerial Tender Committee when millions are alleged to have been stolen at the Devolution ministry.The two denied multiple counts relating to abuse of office, conspiracy to commit an economic crime and willful failure to comply with laws relating to procurement.&ldquo;I have considered several factors including particulars of the charges against the accused. I am also aware that the matter is of public interest. I have considered the fact that the accused are of high social standing,&rdquo; Milimani senior principal magistrate Felix Kombo said while releasing them on bail.The duo who failed to turn up last Friday to take plea will now be prosecuted alongside former PS Peter Mangiti and 21 others who were charged over their involvement in the award of a tender for the supply and delivery of training materials worth Sh47.6 million.The prosecution claims the tender in question was irregularly awarded to Blue Star Limited for specialized plant equipment and machinery for training material by the NYS.It is among many others that were paid by NYS leading loss of over 1 billion shillings. The magistrate lifted arrest warrants he issued last week after he was informed that the two had not gone into hiding as then alleged.Kombo further canceled an order that had required Harakhe and Noor to forfeit Sh 50,000 bail they posted the day they recorded statements with the EACC.&ldquo;It is clear the two have voluntarily presented themselves in this court. I have also considered the fact that the prosecution is not keen to pursue that application&rdquo; Kombo observed.Lawyer Ahmednassir Abdulahi and Roger Sagana represented the duo.The two lawyers urged the court to lift the warrants saying their clients were not bonded to appear in court on November 25, but had been informed that they will take plea on November 29. The case will I mentioned on December 9.
