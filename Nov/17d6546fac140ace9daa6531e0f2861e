Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has confirmed Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt will train with the club.Bolt, 30, revealed the news in an interview on Saturday in which he reiterated his hope to play for Manchester United.The athlete is an ardent supporter of Manchester United."We decided this some time ago. Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden, who is a member of our board, has told us that Usain is highly interested in practising with us. For us that's no problem. Our coach Thomas Tuchel likes the idea as well," Watzke told Sport Bild."Of course he won't visit us in an important week with Champions League matches, but maybe in the pre-season. We are delighted and take this as an honour."Bolt is a nine-time Olympic gold medallist who competed in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 games, and won the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4x100m relay in each.Bolt, aka the world's fastest man, has never hidden his affection for the Red Devils and once spoke to former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson about having a trial at Old Trafford.He revealed last year that he would still be interested in taking up the offer, confidently claiming he would be handed a five-year contract at the end of the trial.Speaking to MUTV, Bolt said: "In my mind I think I should do a trial and see if they would say 'Alright, come on in' or if they would say 'No, you are not any good. "I think I would be pretty good because I am fit, I am quick, I can control the ball and I understand all of the play."So I think if I do a trial then they would say, 'You know what, here is a contract for five years! You are 30 years old, here's a five-year contract. Let's just do it!"
