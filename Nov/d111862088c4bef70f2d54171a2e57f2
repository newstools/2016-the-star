MP John Mbadi wants Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Korir Sing oe, a top aide of Deputy President William Ruto, grilled by the Public Accounts Committee over the NYS scandal.The ODM chairman, himself a member of the committee, yesterday said the two and Farouk Kibet, another aide of Ruto, have been mentioned adversely in connection with the receipt of proceeds from the multibillion scam and must be questioned.Murkomen and Sing oe, who are partners in Murkomen and Sigei Advocates, are said to have been paid Sh15 million by Out of The Box Solutions, a company contracted by the Devolution ministry for consultancy.Read: Murkomen, Ruto's aide got sh15 million devolution cashKibet is said to have received Sh1 million from NYS architect Ben Gethi and called him 150 times during the rip-off. Mbadi said given the huge public interest the matter has generated, including Murkomen s public statements, the committee has no option but to summon the three to appear before it to shed more light. For the committee to come out as neutral, objective and fair, everybody adversely mentioned should get similar and equal treatment, including being asked to appear before the committee without exceptions, he said in his letter to PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo.Mbadi said the committee will then have an opportunity to interrogate the trio deeper to protect the public interest in the ongoing probe into the intricate web with regard to the Sh1.6 billion siphoned from NYS. There is no justification of leaving out Murkomen who seems to know a lot and Kibet who, according to evidence before the committee, received money from individuals under investigation and had a lot of contacts with individuals in question, the Suba MP said.Mbadi warns the committee risks losing respect and dignity accorded to it and our report will lack credibility if we are seen to be shielding some witnesses from interrogation. The letter is copied to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Clerk Justin Bundi, majority leader Aden Duale and minority leader Francis Nyenze. The committee had resolved to request the three to provide written submissions. It would then invite them for grilling depending on the contents of their submissions.
