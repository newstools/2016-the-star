Religious leaders in Bungoma have condemned MCAs for legalising sale and consumption of busaa, saying it contributes to alcoholism and poverty.The County Alcoholic Drinks Act, 2015, regulates allows and regulates sale and consumption of traditional liquor, including busaa.The Interior ministry says the county violates national law which prohibits manufacure, sale and consumption of busaa and other traditional liquor.The clerics, led by pastor Humphrey Wanyama, said the law is unconstitutional and promotes drunkenness.He spoke to journalists on Sunday after officiating at a service at Jesus to all Nations Church, Milo, in Webuye West. We, as religious leaders, are saddened that in 2016 we are still having leaders turning the clock back to 1979. This law will make residents engage in drinking alcohol instead of going to work, Wanyama said.He said the MCAs who passed the bill want the electorate to be too drunk to question leaders decision, especially head of the elections.The clerics said MCAs did not think of jobless youth who will drink busaa all day. Drunkenness prevents people from voting, they said. But leaders also buy liquor for youth to make them vote for them. Alcohol is the door to poverty and chaos. This will make us a drunk county with no future, Wanyama said.
