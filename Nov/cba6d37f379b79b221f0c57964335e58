Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi yesterday donated Sh1.5 million iron sheets to Kangemi Harambee Traders to rebuild their stalls.The traders lost property worth Sh10 million during a fire last Thursday. The market, owned by the Kangemi Market Welfare Association, had 660 stalls and 3,000 traders.There has been speculation of arson because of land ownership disputes.Some residents opposed City Hall s plans to modernise the market at a cost of Sh1.6 billion.The initiative was to be funded by the World Bank and county government. Wanyonyi said, I won t allow landgrabbers to take over this market. This market is meant to serve all Kenyans. It does not belong to a few individuals. Grabbers have no chance here.
