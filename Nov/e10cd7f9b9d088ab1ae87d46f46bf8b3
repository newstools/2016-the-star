Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has called for the arrest of former devolution CS Anne Waiguru over the Sh1.6 billion theft at the youths agency.Waiguru fiercely defended herself in Parliament against claims she masterminded the heist but Ababu said the President should use his power to arrest her and other suspects."As a President you swore to defend and protect the constitution of our country. Corruption threatens the existence of our nation," he noted in an address in Eldoret on Friday."People like Anne Waiguru... arrest these fellows and deal with them decisively."Read: Agitated Waiguru attacks Kabura, calls her puppet in Sh1.6b NYS fraudAlso read: Waiguru probe summary: Furor, more shocking revelations at lengthy NYS scam grillingAbabu further said people like businesswoman Josephine Kabura, who bragged about withdrawing Sh60 million in a day, and had evidence on the scam, should not go scot-free."Why are they free? They should be arrested," he said and accused Uhuru of "relaxing" in the war on corruption."When money is stolen from the health department...with all the key drivers of the economy, it poses risk to the survival of our nation," he said.Read: Uhuru sister, cousin were paid Sh200m Health cashAlso read: Kenya needs to see a 'big fish' convicted of corruption - EACC bossAbabu, who is Labour Party of Kenya leader, asked the President to take the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not all-talk and no action.He said his newly-relaunched party had not picked a presidential candidate for the August 8, 2017 general election but will do before the year ends."We will soon make a decision. But if you look at me, am I not capable of gunning for the top seat like the other leaders who have declared their interest?" he asked.Watch: [VIDEO] Ababu game plan confuses friends, foes
