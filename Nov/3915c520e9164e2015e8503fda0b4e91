Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery should order the resumption of disarmament in the county to avoid violence.Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani said illegal arms have led to attacks, with many residents being killed and thousands being displaced.Since the disarmament began, peace and calm have prevailed. Stopping it would escalate clashes, he said.The legislator criticised Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel, Samburu North s Aloise Lentoimanga (vice chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Security) and Lati Lelelit (Samburu West) over their petition to Nkaissery to stop the disarmament.Residents of the volatile region who have fallen victim to armed herders are not happy with the insensitive petition, Karani said.a colony of samburu It is apparent the government wants to make Laikipia a colony of Samburu. Laikipia people have been killed in the skirmishes and thousands of others displaced by clashes, which are being perpetrated by people coming from Samburu, he said. We asked for the disarmament as Laikipia people who are suffering at the hands of outsiders whom we accommodated with their thousands of livestock after the raging drought threatened to wipe out their livestock. Leaders are contemplating boycotting a security meeting that Nkaissery is expected to attend on Wednesday, if he fails to order continuation of the disarmament, Karani said. As the local community, we are angry since we feel that a few people are converging and making unpopular decisions on behalf of us who are suffering, he said.His sentiments were supported by nominated MP Sarah Lekorere.On Friday, MCAs from Laikipia reprimanded Lempurkel and the other MPs from Samburu for asking the CS to stop the disarmament.Killed by armed herdersThe skirmishes have been experienced in Sosian, where several residents have been killed by armed herders.Sosian MCA Jacob Endom said colleagues from Samburu want to dictate how Laikipia should be governed even after being accorded the goodwill to look for pasture in the county. You can imagine a situation where they lifted a woman high and told her to see how their cattle were devouring her crops. It was so painful and this madness must be stopped, he said.No MP addressed the issue or sought the government s intervention after the killings, Endom said. It is therefore hypocritical of the MPs to seek government intervention with false claims that women are being raped, he said.Endom was with Paul Leshuel of Mukogodo East Ward and Rumuruti MCA Joseph Suge.
