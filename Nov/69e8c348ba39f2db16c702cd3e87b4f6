Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has told off National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi for leading his Ndamata clan to endorse Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire for governor.On Saturday, he said Muturi erred by reintroducing clannism, since the young people do not even know what clan they belong to.On October 29, Muturi led his Ndamata clan in endorsing Mbarire for the county s top seat.Kivuti said the Mbeere Council of Elders carried out a ritual in 2013 in Kaimere village to bury clannism. Elders cursed anybody who would bring back divisions among the Mbeere community along clan lines. It would be sad for anybody to bring a curse upon himself for introducing clannism in the county, he said.Kivuti reminded Muturi that interdenominational clergy, including Mbeere ACK Bishop Moses Mashamba, also buried clannism in a ceremony held in Nyangwa village. He spoke to more than 1,000 residents of Mavuria, Mbeti North and Kiambere wards.Muturi had earlier on chaired a day-long indoor clan meeting at Mountain Breeze Hotel in Embu. It was attended by more than 400 men, since women are traditionally not allowed to attend such meetings. He refused to speak to the press. Sources said the meeting was also attended by some top county leaders.
