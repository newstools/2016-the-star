Defending yourself loudly in public rallies will never save you from the NYS scandal, former IG David Kimaiyo (pictured) has told Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. He told Murkomen to record a statement with the DCI and the EACC, instead of defending his name, as well as linking other leaders to corruption in rallies. &ldquo;Why are you trying to get public support if you are innocent?&rdquo; Kimaiyo asked on Saturday.
