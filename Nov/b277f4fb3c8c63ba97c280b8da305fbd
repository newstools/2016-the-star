They have eaten all the meat and are now eating medicine,&rdquo; he said at Gina Primary School in Gem on Friday.&ldquo;We have run out of patience as a country and the only way to secure our resources from being looted by Jubilee government is to vote them out."[VIDEO] We got Sh41 million health tender legally - Uhuru cousinMidiwo claimed Waiguru deceived the committee about doing everything above board to tame corruption at the agency, to the extent to branding herself a whistle blower.The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee said Kabura may have only been an accomplice in the scam and asked her to name those who orchestrated the theft.&ldquo;If your two-year old child steals a cow from the next home, when police come they will not arrest the juvenile but the owner of the home," the MP said and maintained that former CS, not her juniors, were the masterminds.The MP said Cord will name those stealing from public coffers before its "mother of demonstrations" if the Jubilee government does not name suspects in the NYS and health scandals.The MP also urged Kenyans to prepare for a change of guard and Uhuru is "absent" and Ruto has been accused of corruption.&ldquo;Who will defeat Raila if it&rsquo;s not going to be a walk in the park? At the moment we have the numbers... We urge our people to turn up in large numbers during elections,&rdquo; he said.He further asked Western leaders to remain united for the common course of kicking the Jubilee government out of power by 9am on the August 8, 2017 polling date.Read: Raila coalition calls mega demo targeting 1 million Kenyans over Sh5b health scam
