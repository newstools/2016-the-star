PSVs plying the Ngong route have on Wednesday evening blocked Moi and Haile Selassie avenues to protest alleged arbitrary arrests of crew and damage of the vehicles by Nairobi County Inspectorate officials . Ngong travellers sacco official Anthony Mwangi said county officers have towed seven vehicles to their yard and damaged five others that are parked at the stage opposite Karrymart supermarket. Several passengers are said to have been injured after the county officers broke the vehicles' windows. Mwangi said the officers disappeared with some of the vehicles' keys leaving drivers stranded. "We pay Sh 6,500 every month for the parking but our vehicles are getting towed away every day. They must compensate us and our passengers for damage and injuries," Mwangi said. Traffic police officers and some county officials manning the roads are making efforts to clear the scene.
