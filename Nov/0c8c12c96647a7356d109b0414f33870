The Kisumu supplementary budget was withdrawn on Wednesday after MCAs complained it lacked clear guidelines on how the requested Sh717 million would be spent.The amount was brought forward on June 30, Budget Committee chairman Willis Ogonyo said. He had tabled the supplementary budget report. This unspent cash, according to the executive, is part of the budgetary allocations appropriated by the assembly in 2015-16, he said. Ogonyo said the balance should have been included in the 2016-17 budget as a pending bill. The assembly approved the county s estimates for 2016-17 just four months ago. East Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi accused the executive of unfair distribution of resources. He said the executive has not allocated money to complete a maternity wing at a hospital in his ward. In other areas like Kabonyo, they have started six new dispensaries. The governor should serve all, not sections of wards, he said.Speaker Anne Adul directed that the budget report be brought back to the assembly after 14 days by the Budget and Appropriations Committee. Minority whip Eddy Anayo said the budget-making process should be done by the whole house, not just by one committee.
