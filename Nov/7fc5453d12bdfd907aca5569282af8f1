Education CS Fred Matiang i violated the constitution when he sacked former Technical University of Mombasa VC Josephat Mwatelah, a court heard on Thursday. Mwatelah's lawyer Habert Ashiruma said the University Council, not the Cabinet Secretary, is tasked with disciplining staff members.Ashiruma also noted the council did not recommend the Vice Chancellor's sacking; he said it agreed on a stern warning and said Mwatelah would eventually return to work.The professor was fired following investigations that raised concerns about integrity and mismanagement of funds.Matiang i overruled the council which had given Mwatelah a warning letter. The former VC had been on suspension since February 25.Read: TUM vice chancellor sacked for funds misuseAlso read: Sacked Mombasa VC wants job back, says council did not terminate servicesThe court heard that four out of seven council members recommended that Mwatelah resume duty. The other three wrote a dissenting opinion which the CS acted upon, said the lawyer.He added that the law allowed Matiang i to set up an independent committee to look into the matter but that he did not do this.Ashiruma said his client was 'sacrificed' because he did not award a tender to a company linked to Kipkurui Lang at, director general of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority.He said Collette Suda, Principal Secretary in the State Department for University Education, had directed Mwatelah to award the tender to Lang at s company.It was for the construction of two technical training institutes in Kinango and Lungalunga, at a cost of Sh50 million each.Ashiruma said his client acted on the recommendation of the Technical, Financial and Evaluation Committee which found Lang at's company unsuitable.But TUM lawyer Titus Mugambi said the council s resolution to reinstate Mwatelah was not binding.Matiang'i's lawyer Emmanuel Makuto said it would be against university policy to rehire Mwatelah. He said the policy which does not allow an individual proved guilty of maladministration to continue holding office.Makuto added that reinstatement orders can only be issued under exceptional circumstance. He said Mwatelah's case was not.The sacked VC, who demanded Sh54 million in the event that he is not reinstated, will know his fate in two months. Justice Onesmus Makau said a ruling will be delivered on January 27.Read more: Suspended TUM VC wants his job back, blames woes on tender row
