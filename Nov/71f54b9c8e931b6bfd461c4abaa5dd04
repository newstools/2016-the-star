A pheasant has become a star attraction at a Chinese safari park after visitors said its golden head feathers resembled US President-elect Donald Trump's famous blond quiff. A picture of a five-year-old golden pheasant called "Little Red" went viral this week after a journalist from the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou pointed out the "striking similarity" between the male bird and Trump, China's ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily reported. The resemblance doesn't stop at the feathers, said Gao Hongqiang, the park's head bird feeder. "After comparing it with the photos ... we've found that not only are their hairstyles alike, their eyes' expressions are pretty similar," Gao told Reuters. Visitors at the park said they saw the similarity. "I think this pheasant is very beautiful and Trump's hairstyle in the US presidential election sprang to mind when I first saw the bird," Jin Huofeng, 34, said. "I was wondering whether Trump's hairstylists got inspired by the golden pheasant."
