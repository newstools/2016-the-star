Four AP officers charged with the torture and murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver want to be released on bail.They said on Tuesday, through their lawyer Cliff Ombeta, that they had a right to be freed.They also said there was no reason for them not to be freed as vulnerable witnesses have been placed in a witness protection programme."From the beginning of this trial [the prosecution] has shown a clear intention of not wanting the accused to enjoy their rights," Ombeta added on Tuesday.The prosecution said it wanted Fredrick Lelima, Leonard Mwangi, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku to remain in remand until the trial ends.Chief inspector Robert Owino, the Law Society of Kenya and the families of the murdered men have also sworn affidavits opposing their release.But Ombeta said no evidence has been presented to show that his clients would interfere with witnesses if freed.More on this: Four cops charged with Willie Kimani murder, detained one monthLast Thursday, the prosecution told the court that chilling and horrific details would emerge on how the four, and a fifth suspect, Peter Kamau, orchestrated the murders.Kamau, alias Brown, is believed to have driven the taxi that KImani, his client Josephat Mwneda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri used before they were abducted, tortured and killed.The three went missing on June 23 after attending a matter at the Mavoko law courts.
