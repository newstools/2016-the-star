ODM delegates in Webuye west constituency have unanimously endorsed American-Kenyan businessman Kelly Walubengo as the party's MP hopeful in the 2017 general election.Led by area party chairman Ali Wazir the delegates said Walubengo was their best bet in ousting the incumbent Dan Wanyama, whom they accused of being biased.Wazir said Walubengo is young and has a chance of clinching the seat because of his manifesto."We have seen Walubengo is man enough because he is a fighter. He is also our son and has been born here and understands the electorates' challenges despite having schooled in the states," the chairman added.He said if elected, Walubengo will ensure he prioritises the education sector by building schools and helping the needy and orphans to get education without being biased.Walubengo, who has lived in the US for more than 20 years, said he intends to improve education in the constituency."I know this is my first time in politics [but] I am not scared because I have the support of my people who want to change Webuye leadership," he said.Walubengo, who is in his early 30s, also said he has started to build a school at Matondoli with the help of 'good friends' from the US. He intends to put up other schools in Miskhu, Matulo and Sitikho.He said he also hopes to give youth opportunities to make use of their talent, adding that he started an eponymous football talent to support the same.Welubengo's joins six other aspirants seeking to unseat Jubilee Party's Wanyama.Others are businessman Kennedy Wanjala alias Mkombozi, Peter Sitati Juma, Arnold Ndukuyu (Nxzioa Sugar Factory ICT director) and Joash Wamangoli (Nzoia chairman).The constituency is likely to see a tight contest between Cord and Jubilee.More on this: Drop biased Wanyama, says Webuye West MP aspirant
