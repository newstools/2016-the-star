Football Kenya Federation President Nick Mwendwa has promised more friendly matches for Harambee Stars during international breaks.Mwendwa said such friendly matches will help the country build a formidable side for future matches. You can see what the friendly matches can do to a nation. We have played six of them and we are unbeaten. We play against Mozambique tomorrow (Saturday) and Liberia on Tuesday and the idea is to make sure that we are involved during Fifa calendar. Mwendwa, who was speaking to the media at Kasarani, also said he is impressed by Harambee Stars recent run and promised to maintain the same. I am so happy with this team. They have impressed me especially in their preparation for matches and that is why I want to stress that our support will be 100 percent. We don t want to take chances with this team because they have shown what they can produce with good preparations. Mwendwa hinted that plans are underway for the team to own their facilities ranging from playing surface, hotel and team bus. There is a lot of planning for this team considering that we have qualifiers as earlier as March next year. We want the team to own a stadium; have a bus and also a good hotel. I am also happy that the technical bench is doing wonders since they took charge. Reports indicated that FKF are in the process of securing a branded bus for the national teams (men and women). A source privy to happenings within the national teams revealed that a leading transport company will provide two buses to be branded Harambee Stars and Harambee Starlets. The deal was sealed few weeks ago and I want to confirm that Coast Bus have entered into an agreement with the federation to provide two buses for the men and women teams. The unveiling of the same could be done in due course. Harambee Stars are in camp preparing to face Mozambique and Liberia in friendly matches.
