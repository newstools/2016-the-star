US President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to express discontent over protests against his victory in the November 8 polls.Trump has accused the media of inciting "professional protesters" and termed the demonstrations as "unfair"."Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!" he said on Twitter.Trump beat Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton in a close race that saw him win 279 electoral college votes against Clinton's 228.Although Clinton won the popular vote by about 200,000 votes, Trump earned the requisite 270 college votes that saw him declared president-elect.The surprise win sparked riots across the US.On the East Coast, protests took place in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, while on the West Coast demonstrators rallied in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland in California, and Portland, Oregon.The protests were for the most part peaceful and orderly, although there were scattered acts of civil disobedience.In the nation's capital, about 100 protesters marched from the White House, where Trump had his first transition meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday, to the Trump International Hotel several blocks away.At least 200 people rallied there after dark, many of them chanting "No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!" and carrying signs with such slogans as "Impeach Trump" and "Not my president.""I can't support someone who supports so much bigotry and hatred. It's heart-breaking," said Joe Daniels, 25, of suburban Alexandria, Virginia.Two Trump supporters stood off to the side carrying signs reading: "All We are Saying is GiveTrump a Chance" - an apparent play on lyrics from the John Lennon song "Give Peace a Chance".Trump's critics worry that his often-inflammatory campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims, women and others - combined with support from the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists - could spark a wave of intolerance against minorities.But Trump's former campaign manager Kelly Conway has defended the president-elect saying he is capable of "uniting the country"."I would just commend the protestors to listen to Donald Trump from his victory speech, where he said, 'I will be a president for all Americans, including those who did not support me and who don't support me,'" she said on "Anderson Cooper 360."
