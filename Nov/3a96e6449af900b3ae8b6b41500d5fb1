Transport CS James Macharia blamed the Kisii county government and police for failing to enforce the orders.The CS questioned the capacity of counties to approve and supervise buildings.He told the parliamentary committee on Transport that the house crumbled due to a weak mix of concrete, quality and loading the building.But Kisii Governor James Ongwae said the county government is not to blame. This culture of passing the buck must stop. This is why during the rescue and recovery efforts, I did not apportion blame to anyone, including the national government," he said.
