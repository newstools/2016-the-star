With the main purpose being to create awareness of cancer in Kenya with the worldwide concept of #NoShaveNovember, the Beard Festival was held on Saturday at the Arboretum grounds in Nairobi. We often have cancer awareness campaigns but are limited types of cancer that mostly affect women, such as breast and cervical cancer. Prostate cancer is given less awareness. We chose November as it is the cancer awareness month for pancreatic, lung, stomach and carcinoid cancer. the event organisers said.
