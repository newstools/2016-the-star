There is a plot to scuttle investigations into the alleged misappropriation of Sh5.2 billion at Afya House, MP Robert Pukose said on Friday. He defended committee chairperson Rachel Nyamai against accusations that she is being used by the executive to block a parliamentary probe.This comes amid claims of a cover-up at the Parliamentary Health Committee. Some members have accused Nyamai of suppressing and silencing "the right direction of questioning".Some 20 out of 29 members have already appended their signatures to a petition seeking Nyamai's removal. They have accused her of protecting Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri from accounting for the money. Mailu has said only Sh3.2 billion was in question and that it was probably spent.Pukose said, Those peddling the allegations are part of a scheme by forces outside Parliament to divert attention in a wider cover-up plot.
