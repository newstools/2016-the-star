Communication technology manufacturer Ericsson s planned launch of new a Cell Tower-Top Site design, will see the company position itself as a prime facilitator of better cell services across Africa.The new design cell towers scheduled for commercial production from July 2017 will offer capacity for a fully integrated suite of signal broadcasters ranging from 2G, 3G, 4G and in future 5G.A host of other broadcast infrastructure options including baseband, radios, and antenna will also be added to the new cell tower design.For all the additions, Ericsson guarantees, cheaper installation. The new design will accommodate current broadcast infrastructure as well as allow room for future upgrades with no additional ground setup. Ericsson calls this the true zero footprint design.The new tower top design solves expansion challenges that include securing space and site permits, installation charges, prospects for future expansion capability, maintenance, and power consumption. With the integrated Tower-Top Site, the need for increased tower footprint in the face of evolving technology is minimized significantly, said Jean-Claude Geha, Ericsson s Head of Region Sub-Saharan Africa.Using industry-standard elements, the site offers improved range, better sensitivity, increased capacity and expansion capability while weighing less and consuming less power.The integrated Tower-Top Site design is developed by Ericsson s Region Sub-Saharan Africa. As a region, we are proud to have taken the lead in the development of this first of its kind design, Geha added.
