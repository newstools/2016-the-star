The state will expand irrigation projects in arid areas to reduce hunger and starvation for lack of food and water.President Uhuru Kenyatta said the government has put 600,000 hectares under irrigation countrywide. By next year, more than one million hectares will be under irrigation, he said.Uhuru spoke on Wednesday when he launched the Sh1.2 billion Wei Wei Irrigation Scheme in West Pokot.The irrigation scheme, initiated by Italian Development Cooperation and Kenyan government, has more than 250 farmers on 325 hectares.The scheme will help increase food production and reduce reliance on relief food, he said. The President reiterated the government s commitment to improve Kenyans livelihoods.He said the Jubilee administration will not be discouraged by those opposing its development projects. I have no time to listen to propaganda and lies spread by our opponents. Hii nchi haitaendeshwa na maneno matupu na porojo (the country will not be governed by empty rhetoric and propaganda), the President said.Uhuru observed that the launched projects will help transform the lives of residents and help end perennial cases of banditry in the region.He urged the Pokot community to join the new Jubilee Party that he said will unite Kenyans.Deputy President William Ruto said Jubilee s development record speaks for itself and will encourage Kenyans to reelect him and Uhuru. We will be judged by what we have done for the Kenyan people, not [by] falsehoods and propaganda, he said.Ruto urged Kenyans not to listen to the propaganda spread by the opposition, adding that they lack any development agenda for Kenya. They complained about the standard gauge railway, roads and equipment for hospitals, but it has backfired for them, he said.
