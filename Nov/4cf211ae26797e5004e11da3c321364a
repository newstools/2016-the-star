North Mugirango MP Charles Geni wants police officers posted to three posts in his constituency to end crime. He has used the CDF cash to construct police posts at Kebobora and Magwagwa. An existing building in Obwari village will house other officers, yet to be posted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of burying my people,&rdquo; Geni said. He spoke on Sunday in Obwari during the burial of David Mberesi who was killed by thugs.
