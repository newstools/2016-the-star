About three million people at the Coast have received drugs to prevent elephantiasis, a potentially crippling disease that can also swell men s genitals to more than 50 times the original size.Medics moved door to door for three days, until Monday, administering medicines in Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu, Tana River and Taita Taveta counties.The exercise targeted 3.5 million people and was jointly carried out by the Ministry of Health, respective county governments and donors.Head of the Neglected Tropical Diseases Unit Dr Sultani Matendechero said the turnout was huge .He said men particularly came out in large numbers. We are now tabulating the data but we expect more than 65 per cent coverage. If there are gaps we will plan a mop-up campaign, he told the Star.spread by mosquitosElephantiasis is spread easily from one person to another by mosquitoes, just like malaria. It can cause severe swelling of the limbs, breasts, and testicles, as well as thickening and hardening of the skin.An estimated 80,000 Kenyan men, mostly from the Coast, have been affected in the testicles and about 55,000 people have swollen legs.The swelling of the testicles into grotesque size and shape is one of the most dangerous symptoms of the disease in men.While it can be corrected through surgery, the morbid swelling of legs can only be managed by providing a minimum care.ERADICATING DISEASEKenya is among the last places where the scary disease thrives. We are committed to eliminating this disease in line with our global 2020 target, Dr Matendechero said.Mombasa County pharmacist Dr Mohamed Hanif urged residents to seek treatment and to sleep under an insecticide-treated mosquito to prevent transmission. This disease is not caused by witchcraft, riding bicycles or because of drinking coconut water; it is caused by an infected mosquito, he said. We thank the Ministry of Health for taking this bold step and we are grateful that they have remembered us. The government plans to run similar campaigns over the next three years after which it shall conduct a Transmission Assessment Survey that will determine whether or not Kenya is certified as Elephantiasis free.
