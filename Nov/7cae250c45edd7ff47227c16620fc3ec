Moses Wetang'ula has faulted President Uhuru Kenyatta for deciding to withdraw troops from South Sudan saying this was unacceptable.Uhuru said regional peace should not come at the expense of the country s dignity, honour and pride. We know the people of this region want peace in South Sudan. But we also know peace will not come by blaming a Kenyan commander for the wider failings of the Mission to South Sudan, he said.More on this: [VIDEO] Kenya unapologetic about pulling troops from South Sudan, says UhuruBut Wetang'ula told the President: ''I want to tell you, Uhuru, that before those troops went to South Sudan the matter when through Parliament. If you want them out of there return it to Parliament and see what MPs have to say,'' said Wetang'ula."This is not a mater to decide on own your own based on personal emotions and pride. That is inexplicable because Kenyans are not aggrieved by a general being sucked by the UN but are proud to see the 6,000 minus one troops bringing peace to South Sudan."The Ford Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator further said a single Kenyan general's alleged misconduct was not reason enough to call soldiers back.''Our Kenyans in Sudan are doing the great task of contributing to the security of the international community and Uhuru should respect that,'' he said.''We all know that Kenyan troops went to war torn South Sudan as good neighbours and according to needs and demands after an understanding between the country and the United Nations through the Security Council."He addressed the press at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre attending the closure of the first three-day conference of the Bukusu Council of Elders.Wetangula, who is also Senate Minority leader, further noted that Kenyan soldiers are respected internationally and have taken part in successful peace keeping missions across the world.He cited missions in Eritrea, Namibia, Mozambique, Siere Leone, Yugoslavia and East Timor, and said Kenya should continuing pursuing peace, especially in neighbouring countries.Read: UN South Sudan mission 'in ruins' after firing Kenyan General - RussiaThe 2017 presidential aspirant was with Luhya Council of Elders chairman Patrick wangamati and MPs Wafula Wamuniyi (Kanduyi), Chris Wamalwa (Kimini), Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren) and James Luwesti (Kabuchai), and Bungoma women representative aspirant Nancy Kibaba.
