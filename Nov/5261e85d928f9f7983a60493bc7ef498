Nairobi is the 10th most visited city in Africa, a recent report by global payments and technology firm suggests. This partly underlines the impact of growing global and regional business forums in the capital. The Mastercard Worldwide 2016 Global Destination Cities Index 2016, which ranks 132 most visited cities around the world, shows Nairobi had 323,859 visitors between January and August this year. Nairobi, however, trails Entebbe which hosts Uganda’s largest airport and official residence of the President. Entebbe, located 37km from capital Kampala, had 616,700 visitors. The Mastercard Index focuses on volume of visitors, expenditure estimates, the overnight international visitor arrivals and their cross border spending to understand how people travel and spend around the world. South Africa’s commercial capital, Johannesburg, remained the most visited city on the continent with 3.6 million visitors mainly from Europe. Cairo is second with 1.55 million visitors, Cape town ( 1.37 million), Casablanca ( 1.05 million),Durban ( 831,051 ), Accra ( 761,872 ), Lagos ( 711,209 ), while Dakar had 590,478 visitors. “Looking deeper into this measurement, the growth trajectories of many of the global destination cities are dynamic and increasingly diverse, as many of them tapped into new sources of growth (feeder cities),” the report states. “As cross-border travel and spending continue to grow at a faster pace than the world GDP (gross domestic product), the world’s cities continue to be engines of broader economic growth.” Other cities in the survey are Tunis with 279,934 visitors, Maputo ( 199,928 ) and Mozambique’s city of Beira which had 9,725 visitors. Nairobi last year cashed in on international forums and visits by global leaders among them outgoing US President Barack Obama. Obama was in the country in July during the sixth Global Entrepreneurship Summit.
