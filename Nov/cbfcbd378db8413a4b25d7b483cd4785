Prisons commissioner general Isaiah Osugo yesterday denied claims that warders torture inmates at the King ong o Prison.His statement comes after a video was aired by the media allegedly showing warders torturing prisoners.Osugo said the officers mounted a search for contraband at the penal facility last Friday. He said they found 50 mobile phones. There was struggle and scuffle in the process of getting those phones since there was a lot of resistance from the prisoners, Osugo said. The inmates used a Techno smartphone, which was left behind, to record the stage-managed video. The bandages were used to fool the public that they were injured. He led a high-powered delegation from his office and was accompanied by Central region police boss Larry Kieng. There was no injury as alleged in the video. There is a lot of falsehood in the clip. We have done our internal investigations. The media should have clarified the matter from our side before reporting this incident, Osugo said.He said the officers who helped smuggle the mobile phones into the prison will be sacked and charged. Osugo said officers who have overstayed at the facility will be transferred.
