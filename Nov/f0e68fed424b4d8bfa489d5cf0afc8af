Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has pledged to increase milk prices in Murang&rsquo;a county from Sh35 to Sh50 in the first 100 days after he is elected governor.He said despite the county government relentlessly praising the achievements it has made in the dairy sector, farmers in Kiambu are enjoying higher milk prices.Kamau spoke on Saturday when he launched his manifesto in Mumbi Grounds, Murang&rsquo;a town.He said the dairy sector, the platform on which Governor Mwangi Wairia campaigned on before the 2013 elections, is not doing as well as it should be.Kamau said he will complete the milk processing plant that the county government has started constructing and establish milk ATMs in all shopping centres.Wairia&rsquo;s administration has established 35 coolers in the wards and invested a considerable amount of money by issuing subsidised high-quality dairy cows and animal feed to farmers.The county government has also brokered a deal with Brookside Dairy Ltd to buy milk from farmers through the Murang&rsquo;a County Creameries.Kamau also pledged to tarmac 100km of road and upgrade 500km of feeder roads in the county every year. The MP said he will start a County Endowment Fund to sponsor needy children.Kamau said his government will operate in a transparent manner and asked residents to hold him accountable if he fails to implement any project in his manifesto. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m promising that if you elect me as your governor, I will be answerable to all of you and will lead a corruption-free government,&rdquo; the MP said.Kamau criticised the projects initiated by the county government, saying they are misplaced and not helpful to residents. &ldquo;I am vying for governor because I want to provide solutions for the problems facing the county government, especially corruption,&rdquo; he said. Kamau said he will ensure all the money allegedly stolen and misappropriated during Wairia&rsquo;s regime is recovered in the first 100 days.The MP was accompanied by, among others, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, Nairobi woman representative Rachael Shebesh, Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura, Murang&rsquo;a woman representative Sabina Chege, Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata and Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi.
