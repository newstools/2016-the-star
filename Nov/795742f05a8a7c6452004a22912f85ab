Laikipia assembly members have supported the ongoing disarmament in the county following a wave of violence that caused deaths of six people and theft of thousands of livestock.Some MPs who include Laikipia North s Mathew Lempurkel, Aloise Letoimaga (Samburu West) and Lati Lelerij (Samburu North) visited Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery on Wednesday to urge him to stop the exercise.Speaking to journalists yesterday at the assembly, the MCAs said they are shocked that the MPs are downplaying the chaos. Sossian MCA Jacob Edung, who represents the area where the killings took place, on Wednesday said a group of herders invaded a farm in Marura and drove their livestock. You can imagine a situation where they lifted a woman high, and mocked her to look down and see how their cows were devouring her crops. It was so painful and this madness must be stopped, Edung said.Rumuruti MCA Joseph Suge said more than six thousand people have been displaced.Mukogodo East MCA Paul Leshuel warned that more people are likely to be displaced, saying the invasion started in his ward four years ago.Following the rising insecurity, county commissioner Chege Mwangi, administration police boss Daud Mohammed and his regular police counterpart Angelus Karuru have been transferred.Multiple sources who did not want to be named yesterday said the three received their letters on Wednesday.
