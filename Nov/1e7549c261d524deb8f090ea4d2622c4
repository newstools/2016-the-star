Tribalism is the only issue in the way of Kenya&#39;s excellence in all matters, Tanzanian President John Magufuli has said and called for its end. Magufuli issued the remarks during a State House banquet in his honour on Tuesday, carefully beginning by saying the truth would be a little piercing. &quot;Lakini lazima niyaseme hapa...Mumalize ukabila.&nbsp;Lazima niseme juu msema kweli ni mpenzi wa Mungu,&quot;&nbsp;he said in Kiswahili. This translates to: &quot;...But I have to say this here... End tribalism. I have to say this because those who speak the truth are loved by God.&quot; The leader, known for drastic measures against vices including corruption, noted his country has 121 ethnic communities that are united under one Swahili tribe. He compared this to Kenya&#39;s 42 which are not united, and noted the addition of the Makonde, as President Uhuru Kenyatta told him. Magufuli said he was certain Kenya could achieve a lot if the tribes joined hands. He asked citizens to embrace peace and love and always put God first. &quot; ...Nina uhakika mkimtanguliza Mungu na mkisimama kati kati kwa kumwabudu mtafanikiwa&nbsp;(I am sure if you put God first and worship him you will succeed),&quot; he said.
