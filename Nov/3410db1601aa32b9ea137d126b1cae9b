The Nation Media Group has apologised for an advertisement in their paper that was aimed at recruiting corruption cartels to work in the government."Join corruption cartels and win government supply tenders without sweat," the paid advert read on Friday.The people sponsoring the advert also left their phone number, but when the Star tried to reach them their lines were not going through.The media house said in a statement, "We highly regret and sincerely apologise for this error."NMG said they do not support such advertisement, adding that it goes against their mission to positively impact society's values and their editorial policy."We have taken immediate action to black list the agent and are reviewing our internal procedures to ensure that such an error never recurs."Kenyans on social media queried why NMG would allow such an advert to run at a time when the country is grappling with corruption in both county and national governments.[VIDEO] Kenya is a bandit economy - CJKomen S.K &rlm;said: "@dailynation this is so unfortunate! Was it really an error as @NationMediaGrp claims in the just released statement?""It slipped through editorial lenses. Wow," Jeffrey Roque said.Corruption cartels have also plagued various ministries and most have been found culpable of misappropriation of funds.Over the past week, the Auditor General has released reports indicating that billions may have been lost through irregular procurement in county governments.More on this: Millions lost by counties, says Auditor General
