National Olympic Committee Kenya first vice chairman Bernard Ekumbo suffered a big blow yesterday after his bid bid to be released on bail pending trial failed.The deputy chairman of Kenya's Olympic committee who was on Friday charged with stealing money and sports kits intended for the team at the Rio Olympic Games was hoping to be freed on bail having spent the weekend behind bars but his application was rejected.In a ruling senior principal magistrate Joyce Gadani said Ekumbo will stay in custody until allegations of child sex abuse made against him are investigated and a report tabled in court. Since there is an ongoing probe and there is a likelihood of more charges being preferred against the accused I will deny him bail for now, Gadani ruled.She was of the view Ekumbo has a right to be freed on bail but the child molestation allegations made by the prosecution are very serious and compelling enough to warrant court deny him bail .The magistrate said she had reached her decision after considering the arguments made by the prosecution, investigators, the constitution and also the bail policy guidelines.She directed the prosecution to hand in the probe report on December 6 2016 when the matter will come for further directions.Ekumbo is the fifth Nock official to be arrested and charged in connection to the loss of millions of shillings meant for team Kenya.Similarly, secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul, Vice-chairman Pius Ochieng and assistant treasurer Stephen Arap Soi are on trial.Another official, Fridah Shiroya, was set free after the prosecution dropped charges against her. She is expected to be a witness in the cases.Ekumbo is accused of stealing Sh1m ($10,500) and the uniforms. He denied both charges.Last week, Ekumbo told the court the cash was deposited into his bank account without his knowledge while he was already in Brazil, and said he was willing to refund all the money.He was arrested on Monday when police officers raided his upmarket Nairobi house, where bales of sports equipment, including running shoes and tracksuits, were found. The court was told to deny him bail because he refused to open up for police prompting them to break into his house.
