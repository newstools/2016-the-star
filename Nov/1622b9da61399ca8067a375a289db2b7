Missing MRC leader Omar Mwamnuadzi could have been killed, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko (pictured) told a Mombasa court yesterday. Sonko made the statement after he was summoned to appear before the court to explain the whereabouts of Mwamnuadzi, whom he had stood surety for. We suspect he has been killed though we do not have any evidence, he said.
