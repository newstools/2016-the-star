Missing MRC leader Omar Mwamnuadzi could have been killed, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko (pictured) told a Mombasa court yesterday. Sonko made the statement after he was summoned to appear before the court to explain the whereabouts of Mwamnuadzi, whom he had stood surety for. &ldquo;We suspect he has been killed though we do not have any evidence,&rdquo; he said.
