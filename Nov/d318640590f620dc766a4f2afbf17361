Two MCAs and a resident have moved to court to block construction of gold extraction plant at the Rosterman mines in Kakamega by a Tanzanian company. They cite safety concerns over use of sodium cyanide to extract gold and say the firm is operating illegally without an environmental impact assessment. Mahiakalo MCA Cleophas Malala, Alex Khamasi (nominated) and Jeremiah Wabuti were granted leave to file a class action suit on behalf of residents of Rosterman and environs.The government, Ajabu E A and Isindu Shihundandi are respondents. The case will be heard on November 15 by senior resident magistrate J Ong ondo.The orders stops Ajabu E A from continuing with plant construction, excavation and dumping excavated material on land bordering the River Isiukhu, pending outcome of the suit.Ajabu has also been barred from using water from Isiukhu for discharge of affluent from the plant.Khamasi, who chairs the county assembly Environment and Water Committee, on Monday said his committee will summon directors of the firm next week to explain why they are operating without approval. We ve realised that it did not carry out an environmental impact assessment before commencing their activities, yet they plan to use sodium cyanide to extract the mineral from gold dust at Rosterman, he said.The company is to excavate gold dust from a plot and move it to a nearby plant it is putting up on the banks of River Isiukhu. The soil will be sieved using toxic sodium cyanide., a standard mining practice.
