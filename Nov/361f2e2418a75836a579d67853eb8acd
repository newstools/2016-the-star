The ongoing male circumcision campaign will save Kenya millions of shillings in averted health costs, from 2026.The campaign has already prevented about 25,000 people, mostly from Western Kenya, from being infected with HIV in the last seven years.The latest modelling data shows the country will reach break-even point in 2026, and thereafter start making huge financial savings.The return on investment is highest if males are circumcised below 20 years, but this return declines steeply with age.In total, the voluntary medical male circumcisions already provided will avert 160,000 new HIV infections by 2030.&ldquo;Voluntary medical male circumcision is efficient. The number of VMMC required to avert one new infection could be as low as five to 15,&rdquo; says John Stover, a member of the US-based HIV Modelling Consortium, who took part in the modelling study.The study was carried out by the National Aids and STIs Control Programme, Avenir Health, Imperial College London, US-based Institute for Disease Modelling and consultants from Kisumu.It costs Sh20,000 every year to keep one person on life-prolonging HIV drugs in Kenya. This means the country is already making huge savings on averted infections, but is spending more money to circumcise more people.For instance, the current national circumcision strategy shows the country expects to spend Sh4.9 billion on VMMC between 2015-2019.The government launched a national VMMC strategy in 2008. The target of 860,000 people was achieved in 2013 and by last year, 1.2 million circumcisions had been carried out. The World Health Organisation recommends VMMC because it cuts the risk of female-male infection by about 60 per cent. As a result, to date, 14 countries have expanded the programme. They are Kenya, Botswana, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The next phase of Kenya&rsquo;s VMMC strategy aims to see 95 per cent of men aged 15 to 49 years circumcised by 2019. Head of Nascop Dr Martin Sirengo says they will widen the target group for VMMC to include boys aged 10-14 years and also introduce circumcision of infants.
