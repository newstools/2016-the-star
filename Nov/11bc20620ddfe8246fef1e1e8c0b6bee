Nairobi Water volleyball teams (men and women) will rely on a blend of youthful and experienced players to win their first ever national volleyball titles as the playoffs kick off in Mombasa on Thursday.Coaches John Mwaniki (men) and Joseph Waiganjo (women) clarified that they are in Mombasa not on holiday but on a mission. We missed the playoffs very narrowly last year because we started the season badly but we have since corrected our mistakes and we are good to go, Mwaniki said during the morning training session at the KPA Makande gymnasium yesterday. He said he will rely on Jimmy Mwaniki, Moses Kurgat, Peterson Kimutai and Stephen Murimi for the big win.Waiganjo on his part said the youthful players he recruited were the drive behind their third position placing in KVF League and vowed to improve on the performance. According to Waiganjo, recruits Damaris Chekolom, Maureen Okai, Lencer Hereto and Eglau Kuloba have comfortably fitted into the shoes of Chemtai Ndiema and Jacinta Miheso, who are on sick leave.
