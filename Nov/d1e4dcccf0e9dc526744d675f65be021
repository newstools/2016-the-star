Mwingi North leaders have urged Kitui Governor Julius Malombe to quit Wiper at the slightest signs that unorthodox means would be used at the primaries to deny him the party ticket to run for reelection.Mwingi North MP John Munuve, who recently quit Wiper for Jubilee Party, said Malombe is in a 'Catch-21' situation. Malombe will face Wiper chairman David Musila in nominations for Kitui governor.&ldquo;I read the early signs that all will not be well and I left Wiper. I am now comfortably in Tuko Pamoja [JP] and fear for those I left behind,&rdquo; Munuve said. Malombe is in a fix and should make a decisive political move, he said.Munuve spoke at Ciampiu trading centre in Mwingi North during a funds drive in aid of Tharaka Girls&rsquo; Secondary School.
