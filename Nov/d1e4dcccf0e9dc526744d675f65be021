Mwingi North leaders have urged Kitui Governor Julius Malombe to quit Wiper at the slightest signs that unorthodox means would be used at the primaries to deny him the party ticket to run for reelection.Mwingi North MP John Munuve, who recently quit Wiper for Jubilee Party, said Malombe is in a 'Catch-21' situation. Malombe will face Wiper chairman David Musila in nominations for Kitui governor. I read the early signs that all will not be well and I left Wiper. I am now comfortably in Tuko Pamoja [JP] and fear for those I left behind, Munuve said. Malombe is in a fix and should make a decisive political move, he said.Munuve spoke at Ciampiu trading centre in Mwingi North during a funds drive in aid of Tharaka Girls Secondary School. Governor Malombe s wife Edith Mawia was the chief guest.The MP s sentiments were echoed by Tharaka MCA Samuel Ikunga (Wiper), former chairman of the defunct Mwingi County Council Philip Kabui and Mwingi North Wiper executive officer Titus Kitheka.Ikunga said Kitui Wiper MCAs who did not support Musila s governor bid were threatened with being denied nomination tickets. Kabui said Tharaka residents in Mwingi North will vote for both Malombe if he runs on another party's ticket.
