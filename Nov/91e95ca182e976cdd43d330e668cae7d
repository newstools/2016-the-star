The National Transport and Safety Authority should introduce price controls for long-distance public service vehicles, a bus company has proposed.Coast Bus managing director Ajaz Mirza said some buses exploit passengers during peak seasons, usually in April, August and December. In Uganda and Tanzania, they have associations that control prices. Kenya should look into it, he said.Mirza spoke on Tuesday during a meeting attended by officials from the NTSA, Kenya Bureau of Standards, Kenya Accreditation Service and other public transport service regulators. NTSA introduced new safety standards.Mirza said buses that increase their ticket prices during peak seasons should have their licenses revoked. I believe ticket prices should be standard, regardless of the season. Doubling or tripling ticket prices because it is December hurts passengers, he said.
