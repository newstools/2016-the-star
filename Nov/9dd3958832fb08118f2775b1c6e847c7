Patients visiting various public hospitals at Tharaka Nithi county were turned away after nurses downed their tools on Monday.The nurses said they took the decision after 90 workers' names were struck off the county's payroll among other grievances that are yet to be settled.Fabiano Marigu, chairman Kenya National Union of Nurses in Tharaka Nithi, said they want their statutory deductions, NHIF premiums remitted."It is a shame to be giving health services to patients yet we cannot get better services ourselves," he said.Marigu said they will not return to work until all their grievances, as stated in their two-week notice of the strike, are addressed.He accused the county of refusing to negotiate with them on the issues they raised on October 14 when they threatened to down tools."We want a round-table meeting with the county to solve our grievances once and for all," Marigu said.The current strike is nearly the tenth since the health function was devolved to counties. Walter Mugambi, the county's health chief officer, said he is not aware of the strike."I will communicate on the issue when I get the notice. I am yet to get the information," he said.Mugambi said all allowances owed to the nurses have been paid and promised to follow up on the claims by the striking workers."I will follow up with the finance department to make sure all is well. But I am aware they have been paid all their dues," he said.Area MPs previously accused Governor Samuel Ragwa of failing to handle the health docket, which has been blamed for rampant strikes in many counties.Read: Meru makes Sh17m loss as nurses strike Chuka Igambang ombe MP Muthomi Njuki said the docket should be reverted to the national government since counties have failed to man it.In September, Tharaka Nithi deputy governor Eliud Mureithi blamed political leaders for the nurses strikes.
