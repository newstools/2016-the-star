The Bungoma government will tarmac a road at a cost of Sh1.1 billion to create a more conducive environment for business .Governor Kenneth Lusaka (pictured) said the 40km Misikhu-Naitiri-Brigadier road connects Bungoma to Kakamega and, by extension, Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia counties.Within Bungoma, the road runs through agriculturally rich Webuye East and Kakamega. The tarmacking of this road opens so many opportunities for the surrounding areas. Farmers will be able to transport their produce to the market faster, Lusaka said.
