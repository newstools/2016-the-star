The re-appointment of a firm to audit the accounts of the Auditor General yesterday caused an uproar in the House with majority leader Aden Duale opposing the move.The Parliamentary Service Commission in August awarded M/S Baker Tilly Merali the tender running for three financial years.This followed a recruitment process that saw bids from four audit firms, M/S Baker, which has been auditing the Auditor General since 2011, win the tender.Auditor General Edward Ouko had asked for a one-year extension of the M/S Baker&rsquo;s contract to allow the company audit the accounts of 2014-15. But Duale rallied the House to go against a report by the PSC seeking the House&rsquo;s approval, saying MPs cannot be used as a rubber stamp when the contract has already been awarded.Adan Keynan (Eldas) tabled the report on behalf of the PSC and withdrew it.&ldquo;So what we are doing is just rubber-stamping a process which has already been concluded? I refuse to be part of it,&rdquo; Duale said.Duale said the procurement should be repeated so that another firm is appointed. He accused M/S Baker of lacking the competence to handle the job.&ldquo;Despite being appointed by this House in 2012 and commissioned in 2013, this firm has not submitted a single report to the National Assembly, which is its employer,&rdquo; he said.Duale also accused the firm of colluding with the Ouko-led agency to serve the interests of the Auditor General at the expense of the House&rsquo;s interest. &ldquo;We have heard of unconfirmed reports of misappropriation of funds, including the irregular purchase of audit vaults at more than Sh100 million,&rdquo; the majority leader said.&ldquo;We have also heard of improper leasing and refurbishment of the offices in Mombasa and the skewed hiring of staff.&rdquo;Duale also accused the firm of conflict of interest after it accepted a consultancy job by the Auditor General within the audit period.He said the company was given a tender to carry out an evaluation of internal control of the Auditor General in the first year before the review was complete.
