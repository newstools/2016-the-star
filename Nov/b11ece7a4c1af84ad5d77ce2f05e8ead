Ten judiciary clerks are facing dismissal from work for using forged form four certificates to get employed.The 10 were among 916 clerks who were employed mid this year, judiciary Public Affairs director Naim Bilal told the Star on Thursday.&ldquo;They have been notified and given an opportunity to respond to the finding,&rdquo; Bilal said, adding a disciplinary committee will sit later in November to discuss individual cases and make recommendations.The discovery means the judiciary undertook a post-employment verification process of 916 certificates rather than doing it before making appointments.But Bilal noted verifying the authenticity of academic and professional papers was a standard and necessary practice in government.He added that the goal is to support the principle of merit in public job opportunities.The judiciary is also awaiting a Knec verification report on 10 more pending cases on individuals suspected to have submitted forged certificates to get clerical jobs. Applicants were required to have attained a C- at the least in the KCSE examinations.Police raided Ndaragwa House on Mfangano Street in Nairobi in April where a cartel that produces fake certificates was based.Among documents found at the location were fake KCSE, degree, birth and police clearance certificates.&ldquo;An undercover police officer walked into the premise and left with a BA in criminology and security studies after paying Sh20,000," said Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome.He urged employers and other institutions to work with authorities to verify the authenticity of certificates presented to them by job seekers and those applying for admission to institutions of higher learning.Read: Police net cartel with fake certificates in Nairobi
