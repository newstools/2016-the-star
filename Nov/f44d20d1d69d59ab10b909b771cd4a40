The Nairobi government has sued the Kenya Defence Forces and its parent ministry over illegal takeover of Mihango Road link in the city.The county now wants the courts to intervene and stop KDF from digging a trench along the road.It also seeks an order to compel KDF to recall its officers, who have been deployed along the road.The county moved to court to protect the interests of Kayole and Mihango residents, who have been using the road for 30 years but now have been denied access. This is the only road the residents of the two estates use to access city centre. In its absence, the only alternative route is the Eastern Bypass, which means they have to travel an extra 20km daily to get to the city.According to court documents, KDF started digging a trench across the link on October 24, without any public participation, a violation of legitimate expectation of residents of the estates.KDF's action also deprives the residents the right to use the road.The county says the link falls under roads to be exclusively managed by the devolved unit. The respondents, in utter abuse of their powers, have also through their armed soldiers restrained applicant s (county government s) constructors from further performing its function of maintaining a county road, in violation of principles of devolution and separation of powers, read the suit papers.The county says unless the orders sought are granted, residents will continue being exposed to untold suffering, insecurity and denial of access to basic rights such as schools, health and business centres.
