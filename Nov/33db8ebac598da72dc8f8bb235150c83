Mobile phones have significantly changed the way people shop, as consumers have the ability to buy anything, anywhere and at any time.Online marketing is currently the next big thing in the world.Traditional marketing modes are slowly being disregarded paving way for more digital modes.Now, Instagram wants to make it even easier for users to find and purchase products by letting retailers showcase up to five items that are clickable in a single post.The facebook owned company is set to test 'shoppable photos' from 20 retail brands to display a specific product's price, description, additional photos and provides a 'Shop Now' button to buy it instantly on the web.The new feature is aimed at keeping Instagram users, who now number more than 500 million, on the app for a longer period as most people during their shopping experience have to leave the site to research and shop from other sites so as to get the products they are looking for.Each post will have a 'tap to view' icon in the photo and when users engage, a tag will appear on various products shown in the post showcasing up to five products and their prices. And to open the product, users simply select a tag.This also displays important product information about the product to the consumer earlier in the journey, all without having to leave the app to search for reviews.
