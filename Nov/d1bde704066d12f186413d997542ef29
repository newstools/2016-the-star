Donkey thefts have increased in Athi River town with the construction of the standard gauge railway, water vendors have said.The traders, who use the animals to peddle water in the town, estates and slums, yesterday told the Star their donkeys were safe before the project began. The SGR project has caused us more harm than good. We have recorded great losses since its implementation, a trader said.They say it is expensive to replace a donkey as they are sold for about Sh7,000.The traders suspect the donkeys are slaughtered and their meat sold in butcheries.This comes barely a week since Athi River residents urged the government to crack the whip on unscrupulous butcheries that trade in uninspected donkey meat. They said incidences of donkeys carcasses found in nearby bushes are alarming.More than 11 carcasses have been found in Mavoko, four in Kathiani, one in Matungulu and several others in Mwala in the last month.
