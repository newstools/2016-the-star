Women in Northeastern have been urged to run for election and not wait for an appointment. Garissa woman representative Shukran Gure yesterday said the region has never has a woman MP, MCA or other elected official, despite its large population.She made the comments after donating more than 1,000 portable market sheds to women vendors at the Garissa market. Gure said it is time for women to rise above backward beliefs that leadership is the preserve of men. Times have changed, and more women have demonstrated that they can offer quality leadership, she said. Women form 52 per cent of the voting population, and if we unite, nothing will stop us from clinching all the elective seats. Gure said women are their worst enemies as they seldom vote for other women,She urged security agencies to be on the look out for individuals seeking political positions and trying to incite communities to turn against each other. Women and children are the most affected by violence, Gure said.
