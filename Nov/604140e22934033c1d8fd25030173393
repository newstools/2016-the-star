Cord leader Raila Odinga has warned Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni against humiliating Kenyan fishermen in Lake Victoria.Raila said Kenyan fishermen belong to the East African Community trade bloc and the fish in Lake Victoria have no boundaries as nobody can tell which waters they belong to . Why are Museveni and his security officers frustrating Kenyan fishermen, accusing them of encroaching on their waters? One cannot identify which fish is from the Ugandan or Kenyan waters, he said.Raila spoke on Usigu Beach in Bondo subcounty on Saturday and urged Museveni to ensure he marks all fish from Uganda or stops arresting Kenyan fishermen as one cannot control fish movements in the lake. How is Museveni justifying that all fish caught on the border of Uganda and Kenya are from Uganda? What if those fish are bred in Kenya and only cross over to feed? he said.The Cord leader called for tolerance between the two governments, saying border security officers should be guided by the common East African rules.He asked the Kenyan security officers to consider embracing the Ugandan fishermen to boost the East African trade relationship. Raila said a good working relationship with neighbouring countries can grow the economy. Creating animosity at our border towns will only lead to clashes, he said.Raila added that going by the pace at which the issue of Migingo Island has moved, it is clear that both Kenyan and Ugandan leaders want to flex their muscles.The last time the issue of the island, which is claimed by both countries, came up, both governments agreed to meet and find a long-term solution but until now there is no clear information.
