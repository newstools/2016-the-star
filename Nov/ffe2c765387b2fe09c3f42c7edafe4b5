Farmers should plant without fear as the rains have begun, Mwingi West MP Benard Kitungi has said. Farmers had feared inadequate rainfall that could lead to a poor harvest and big losses."The rains have started in November and it's a bit late, but we hope we will get something better. Now that it is raining, every farmer should plant and those who claim there are no rains and sit at home should think twice as they see their friends going to their shambas. It's better to try," Kitungi said.He urged farmers to rely on extension officers to get the suitable seeds for this season.Drought resistant foods such as sorghum, green grams and cowpeas are always the best, he said."Our farms are very fertile and farmers are very hardworking too that's why we harvest a lot when rains are enough," Kitungi added.He also urged farmers to avoid selling their produce to middlemen who exploit them.The MP further cautioned parents against letting their children play near rivers during the heavy rains, saying they could slip in and drown.
