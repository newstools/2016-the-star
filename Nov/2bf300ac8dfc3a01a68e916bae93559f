Employing her trademark front-running tactics, Olympic 10,000m fourth-placer Alice Aprot claimed a comprehensive victory over 8km at the 23rd edition of Campo a Traves Soria International in the north-central Spanish city on Sunday.Aprot became the third successive Kenyan winner of the women s senior race in Soria and the 12th in event s history, following in the footsteps of prestigious names such as Sally Barsosio (1994), Vivian Cheruiyot (2007), Linet Masai (2009, 2015) and Mercy Cherono (2014).Aprot covered the 8km course in 26:18 and defeated a solid international field in the process. Uganda s Juliet Chekwel, who has twice finished inside the top-15 at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, was a distant second in 27:30 with Olympics 1,500m finalist, Sofia Ennaoui from Poland third in 27:51.Uganda s Timothy Toroitich was back in winning form in Soria after narrowly being out-sprinted in Atapuerca last weekend.Toroitich, who became the first three-time winner in race history, covered the 10km in 29:10 to defeat Eritrea s world U-20 10,000m silver medallist Aron Kifle by ten seconds while his namesake Goitom Kifle (no relation), finished third in 29:44.Elsewhere, last year s runner-up Pat Tiernan ended Kenyan Edward Cheserek s reign at the NCAA Cross Country Championships with victory on a sodden and windswept course in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Saturday.Cheserek was looking to claim an unprecedented fourth successive victory but the University of Oregon standout, who began as the overwhelming favourite, had to settle for a distant third in 29:48 over 10km behind Australian Tiernan (29:22) and Syracuse s Justyn Knight (29:28) from Canada.
