Runda residents on Sunday held protests against the construction of a petrol station in the area.The residents blocked the Eastern bypass near Two Rivers Mall for the better half of the morning. They were led by Runda MCA Kamau Thuo and the leaders of Runda Gardens Residents Association.Youths from the nearby Githogoro slums engaged the police in running battles as they lit bonfires, carried stones on the road and commandeered vehicles off the road.However, police managed to clear the road after dispersing the youths."Runda is an area with controlled development. We do not want the petrol station set up here because that is violating the law. We want the construction of the petrol station stopped," said Karura MCA Kamau Thuo.According to Thuo, City Hall had initially not approved the change of user from Residential to Petrol Service Station.However, he said that he was shocked after City Hall again accepted the change of user."In the reference letters you send to us in February 2016, you had indicated that the change of user granted 15/12/2015 had been cancelled and that you have not received any further development proposals in respect of the above plot," read a letter written by the Runda Gardens Residents Association to the Director of Urban planning at City Hall.The letter went on to say that the residents are dismayed to observe that the construction works are going on with a site sign board indicating an approval by the County Government of Nairobi plan registered as NO AJ 564."We object to the irregularly granted approval which has been done despite our written objections to your office and without following due process as required under the provisions of the physical planning act cap 286 and the Environment Management Coordination Act cap 387 of the laws of Kenya" said Daniel Ngobia the chairman of Runda Gardens Residents Association.The petrol station is being put up by Jamal Yasin.Yasin nor his agents could not be reached for comment.The residents and the MCA said that they will block the construction and that the petrol station should be demolished.
