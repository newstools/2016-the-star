State House yesterday accused the opposition and the media of misrepresenting President Uhuru Kenyatta s agenda for Kenya.In his weekly briefing, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the government is concerned that the media is being used to misrepresent the facts. Stating opinion and half-baked stories as fact must be one temptation we would urge journalists to run away from, he said.The President s agenda is firmly continuing to invest in Kenyans and in projects that lead to the improvement of their lives and welfare, Esipisu added. Obviously other people from opposition parties have their own agenda, seeing as they were not voted into any office. But the President is focusing on service delivery, he said.Esipisu noted that the government is focused on bringing electricity to schools and homes in every party of Kenya.The state also wants to provide subsidised fertiliser for farmers, he said.The Jubilee administration is focused on investing in the Port of Mombasa and building a new port in Lamu, and making the legislative and administrative changes necessary to improve the ease of doing business, the spokesman said. The President is taking the decisions required to grow our economy and uplift the lives of the Kenyan people, Esipisu said.
