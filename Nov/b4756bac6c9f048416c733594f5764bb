Any Kisumu county resident above the age of 18 without a national ID or has not applied for one will be arrested. The county commissioner Mohamed Maalim yesterday said it is a requirement by the government that every citizen acquires an ID. If you are cornered without an ID then the best thing is to make you a guest of the state, he said. The commissioner launched a committee that will coordinate the issuance of ID and registration of birth and death certificates in Kisumu county. The commissioner expressed concern over laxity of residents to collect their ID cards. More than 11,728 cards, 2,000 birth certificate and 400 death certificates are yet to be collected.
