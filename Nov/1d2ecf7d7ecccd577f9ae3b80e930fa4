Literary icon Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o (pictured) has warned Kenyans against enslavement if they abandon their ethnic languages at the expense of other languages.He spoke when he presided over the First Annual Kiwimbi-Amagoro book festival in Teso North subcounty on Saturday. Ngugi urged Kenyans to grasp their languages before mastering others.&ldquo;If you master your language first and learn others later, that is empowerment. When you learn other languages at the expense of your own, that is enslavement,&rdquo; he said.Ngugi urged Kenyans to write stories in their languages to promote their culture. &ldquo;National cultures should be rooted in every village with a book centre.&rdquo; He watched his play The Black Hermit performed in Teso language by students Victor Papai and Barbara Mbone.
