Literary icon Ngugi wa Thiong o (pictured) has warned Kenyans against enslavement if they abandon their ethnic languages at the expense of other languages.He spoke when he presided over the First Annual Kiwimbi-Amagoro book festival in Teso North subcounty on Saturday. Ngugi urged Kenyans to grasp their languages before mastering others. If you master your language first and learn others later, that is empowerment. When you learn other languages at the expense of your own, that is enslavement, he said.Ngugi urged Kenyans to write stories in their languages to promote their culture. National cultures should be rooted in every village with a book centre. He watched his play The Black Hermit performed in Teso language by students Victor Papai and Barbara Mbone.
