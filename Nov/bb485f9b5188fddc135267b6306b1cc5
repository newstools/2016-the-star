There were protests in
Takaye, Malindi subcounty, after community members claimed a tycoon has
grabbed four acres set aside for a
secondary school. Residents
demonstrated at the disputed land, saying they wanted their land back. This is after Malindi businessman Japhet Shutu, alias Janja, started to erect a perimeter wall
at the disputed property, ‘to allegedly help’ 96-year-old Guyo Bajila "grab", who he say owns the land. The land does not have a title deed but Bajila has a document signed by a chief showing the land belongs to the family. At the same
site, there was an ongoing project of a secondary school. On Saturday, residents stormed the
site and ordered the workers to stop building the perimeter wall, until the
matter was resolved. The two factions engaged
in a heated debate that turned chaotic and police had to be called to maintain order. Two people were arrested during the protests. Former councillor David Mitsanze yesterday said Guyo was not the owner of the land and was being used
by Shutu who is well-off to grab the land. “This piece of land was
given to the community by Lohana community who proposed to build a secondary
school," he said. Reached for comment on Sunday,
Bajila dismissed the claims, saying his family has occupied it for more than 70 years. He showed documents of a judgment delivered by Justice Oscar Angote, which ruled in his favour and recognised
him as the legal owner. Shutu on his part said he
was helping the old man to safeguard his property from being grabbed.
