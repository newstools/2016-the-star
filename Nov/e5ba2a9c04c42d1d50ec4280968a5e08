Tiaty MP Asmam has described himself as a "hard nut to crack" and said his opponents are "toothless and shy".Political temperatures have been rising in the constituency ahead of the 2017 general election set for August 8.&ldquo;If they were brave enough to unseat me, they would have tabled their political agendas to the people by now,&rdquo; he told the Star on Wednesday.&ldquo;They already feel that I am a hard nut to crack. That is why instead of presenting their manifestos, they are busy engaging in petty politics... discrediting my work and saying I am a non-performer."Kamama will vie for re-election against Baringo speaker William Kassait (Kanu) and engineer Pepe Kitambaa who is torn between Jubilee and Kanu.He said politicians intending to vie on Kanu tickets were yet to give the people something tangible to warrant their election.They are therefore bound to fail, he said, and dismissed claims that the Pokot community was a Kanu zone.He termed the claims empty talk by West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo and former Information minister Samuel Phogisio, whose plans he said were heading nowhere.Read: Kamama is 'poor lad' whom Moi educated, introduced to politics - LonyangapuoKamama noted that he has used the CDF to to improve food security, education, employment and roads&ldquo;In fact my record in public fund utilisation is next to no one's in Kenya,&rdquo; said the legislator.Kamama also pointed out that the number of secondary schools in the constituency will be increased to 12 and water points from 25 to 140.He also noted that the number of candidates increased from 89 to 1,300, and that a sum of Sh40 million had been pumped into the bursary programmes for secondary schools, colleges and universities.Kamama, who is also National Assembly security committee chairman, also said he has worked tirelessly to restore peace among the warring Pokot, Turkana, Samburu, Tugen and Marakwet communities.He said he has been collaborating with security officers including Kenya Police Reservists.&ldquo;My communities have engaged in fierce tribal clashes and cattle rustling for the last 50 years.
