The principal of Boma Secondary school in Kitale was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly bribed supervisors to leak an exam to students.Godfrey Lokorito was arrested by detectives minutes after he returned to the school from the collection centre where he had accompanied the supervisors to deliver examination papers.Sources at the school told the Star that the principal had influenced an immediate transfer of an invigilator after the said teacher refused to collaborate in the exam malpractice.The source said Patrick Ambani was apparently transferred to St Josephs' school on day two of the exams after an argument arose between him and the principal.According to the source, Lokorito went to the exam collection centre on Monday at 5am where he reportedly asked for the papers to be opened before they were delivered to the students.According to an official at the school which is registered as a private examination centre, it was here that Ambani refused to be part of the deal on the leakage of the maths paper.It is said the principal later held a closed door meeting with the invigilators and the supervisor from 1pm till 6pm. The details of the meeting remaining undisclosed."On Tuesday, the principal collected the exams in a private car with a different lady driver which caused a lot of suspicion," the official said.Read: KNEC allays fears of KCSE Mathematics, Chemistry exam leak He said after some investigations, they discovered that the school driver had resigned after the principal tried to force him participate in the malpractice."Our preliminary investigations established that the principal wanted to use the lady driver to bribe the supervisor and invigilators so that they could open the papers before they are issued to students," the source said."We alerted the police over the issue and they picked the lady for interrogation. It is after the lady was arrested that we believe she gave critical information that led to the arrest of the principal," the source added.Ambani denied the claims that he had been forcefully transfered to another exam centre after he refused to collect a bribe."I was transferred under normal circumstances. Those saying I was forcefully transfered are only spreading propaganda," Ambani said.The Star however established that an invigilator cannot be transferred to another centre once he/she has started working in a particular centre.KNEC chairman Prof George Magoha said though the council had not received information about the incident, anyone whether a security officer or an invigilator who will compromise with the exams will be dealt with."Any teacher, be it principal or even the driver that will compromise with the integrity of the ongoing exams will pay the consequences and will serve as an example to the rest," he said on telephone.Read: Teacher arrested in Kisii for impersonating student during KCSE Chemistry test
