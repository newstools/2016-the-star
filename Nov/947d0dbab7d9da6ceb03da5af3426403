Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya took pleaon Wednesday in an assault case that has been running for more than eight years.Oparanya denied the charges when he appeared in person before Butere principal magistrate Charles Mutayi.The charge sheet indicated that on August 17, 2008 at Mabole in Butere, he and others not before the court attacked John Ojwang, causing him bodily harm. He was released on a free personal bond of Sh300,000.A warrant for the Governor's arrest, that had been issued in October, was lifted. The warrant was issued upon the request of prosecutor Maina Gachoya after the county boss failed to show up in court.But Kakamega county attorney Moses Sande said the summons was not served directly."The summon was served to his secretary in the evening. The accused had moved out of office because of his busy engagements. It had not reached him by the time he was required to appear," Sande said on Wednesday.He added that the accused was willing to present himself in court at any other time.The magistrate ruled that the summons were served within a very short time and to a third-party.But Mutayi warned: "The accused will attract a warrant of arrest if he will not present himself the next time."The matter will be heard on January 17, 2017.More on this: Oparanya assault case in Butere court
