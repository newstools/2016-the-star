The proposal to have the second phase of the standard gauge railway pass through the Nairobi National Park has been met with sustained protests from conservationists and other interested parties.With the benefit of hindsight, this was largely to be expected as the park, which is home to diverse species of wildlife, is a unique national treasure.It is celebrated as the only natural and protected wildlife habitats in the world within touching distance of a capital city.As part of its planning, and to its credit, the contractor of the stretch between Nairobi and Naivasha &mdash; the China Communications Construction Company &mdash; had already exhaustively mapped the potential risks to wildlife in the park and came up with an elaborate mitigation plan.For starters, the CCCC undertook to ensure no construction work began on-site without its employees and contractors going through an elaborate training and sensitisation campaign on wildlife protection. This would ensure employees and contracted parties know what to do whenever they are confronted by certain wildlife conservation situations.This policy is being implemented by the contractor in the Nairobi-Naivasha phase, whose construction started on September 1, and is expected to be ready for commissioning on November 25, 2017.Employees are expected to keep away from wild animals. The training also includes instructions on how to behave in case of an encounter. There will be maximum security for employees, who are expected to avoid any form of poaching, walking or taking photos as such activities may be disruptive to wildlife.Beyond training, another key mitigating factor is embedded in the project&rsquo;s design itself. Based on its own research and extensive consultations with the Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Railways Corporation, the CCCC has ensured the SGR route is confined only to non-core areas of the park. This will ensure minimum impact on the park&rsquo;s diverse flora and fauna.The result is a route that passes through the national park in the middle, with a long bridge, a plan that has been accepted by all the relevant stakeholders. The total length of the bridge, which is the centrepiece of the design work, is 8.63km, with 6.4km located within the park. The height entering the park is 5 metres and height leaving the park is 38 metres, with an average pier height of 18 metres. The route passes through the non-core area of the park with scarce wildlife activity.The long bridge will allow free passage of wildlife under the structure with functional and eco-friendly design imposing limited impact on the wildlife.Such have been the high levels of optimisation of route alignment that the possibility of interference with wildlife has been significantly minimised: There will be no relocation of the petroleum pipeline, while a number of villas in Karen have been spared the disruptive effects of demolition and the expensive and normally long-drawn-out land acquisition process.Two stations, at Ongata Rongai and Ngong, have been included as integral to the route plan and to ensure the population in these areas gain maximum economic value from the SGR line.Still on the design, power barriers have been incorporated on both sides of the track to minimise noise pollution and the distractive effects it can have on wildlife.The contractor has undertaken there will be no blasting in areas that have a heavy wildlife population. Where this is absolutely imperative, it will be controlled, with preventive measures put in place before execution.In areas where drilling is necessary, especially for water, the CCCC is expected to backfill any resultant holes and pits with the same dislocated soil.Access to the site will be through one way only: A designated road on a route that has been agreed on by the relevant parties. The road will be built within the Right of Way or construction corridor and parallel to the railway line.Gravel surface will be adopted with two carriageways of 7 meters width in total. A 2.5 per cent slope will be adopted, with temporary drainage ditches on each side.Wire mesh will be erected to isolate the construction area and ensure the safety of both the animals and humans working on the track. Police and security guards are to be stationed with designated staff at both the entrance and exit. When there is no vehicular traffic, the entrance will be closed.
