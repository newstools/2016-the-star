This is Us might be unravelling the lives of family members whose lives are intertwined in more ways than just sharing a birthday. But the fact of the matter is the series is a story that is so real in its portrayal that we can believe it could be narrating our own lives. The show follows the lives of triplets, one of whom is adopted, who share a birthday with their father. The most unique aspect of the show is the way it is chain-linked; it weaves itself between the present and past, going all the way back to the beginning of the family line, to understand what truly connects them. Star rating: 4 stars
