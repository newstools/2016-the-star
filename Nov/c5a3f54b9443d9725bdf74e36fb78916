Nairobi county askaris have been barred from clamping and demanding fees from vehicles parked at St Peter Claver s Church compound on Racecourse Road. The order was issued by judge George Odunga after an application by the Archdiocese of Nairobi Kenya Registered Trustees, which fully owns the land housing the church and priests houses. In their suit papers, the trustees said the land is private property, which is by law exempted from paying for parking.The land is fenced with a stone wall and the gate is clear that it is a private property, they said. The trustees said they were forced to file the case because once in a while, county officials have made it a habit to invade the compound and clamp vehicles, demanding parking fees. They said it is illegal for the county officials to clamp the vehicles and demand parking fees.
