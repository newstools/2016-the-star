North Rift leaders allied to DP William Ruto have expressed dissatisfaction at being left out of President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaign team.This is after West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin was selected to play a key role in Jubilee Party's Presidential Campaign Team.Kachapin was named alongside eight other people from the Rift Valley region.They include Turkana's Senator John Munyes and woman rep Joyce Emanikor, together with Trans Nzoia woman rep Janet Nangabo.But leaders are asking for the list to be revised to include members from counties considered to be Ruto's stronghold.They include State House political advisor Joshua Kuttuny, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Nandi) and Stephen Sang (Uasin Gishu)."Jubilee must have some key people from those region in that team and we urge that the list be revised," said Stephen Cherargei, who is vying for Governorship in Nandi.He said the DP had promised to revise the list but they want it done sooner."We need structures in the party in all counties so that we start plans for the next polls immediately," he said.Sang expressed confidence that the list will be revised.The list was released following the Special National Governing Council meeting at Bomas of Kenya attended by Uhuru and Ruto last Friday.Kachapin joins the campaign committee having been one of the leaders who recently ditched their parties for the ruling Jubilee party.More on this: Kachapin to wipe out Kanu in West PokotInsiders say the West Pokot Governor was selected because of his neutrality.
