Sofapaka&rsquo;s defender Noah Abich is the October Sportpesa Footballer of the Month Award winner.The play-maker drew his relegation-ridden side closer to survival in the premiership, netting the staggering winner goal in Batoto Ba Mungu&rsquo;s 2-1 victory over Muhoroni Youth. A week later, the illustrious but unsung set piece maestro, provided two assists from splendid free kicks during Sofapaka&rsquo;s 3-2 win over former celebrated champions AFC Leopards.The award will no doubt inject some drive into Sofapaka&rsquo;s survival struggle as they take their last stride in the league that will determine their fate as they face Thika United this Saturday.Abich, 30, who linked up with the 2009 league winners in June, received the gong accompanied with a giant LG television and Sh100,000 cash money. His solo performance in October eclipsed everyone in the league, leading to a landslide victory in the polls for &lsquo;Player of the Month&rsquo; award.With his team teetering on the brink of relegation, Abich, known for being economical with his words issued a rallying call to his mates ahead of a league tie that could end Sofapaka&rsquo;s eight-year premiership stint.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to be recognised but there is no time to celebrate as we (Sofapaka) are all anxiously looking forward to the weekend fixtures. Our fate hangs in balance and I hope this award motivate the squad to do well, and hopefully get a favourable result in the other determining game,&rdquo; said Abich at the club&rsquo;s training base at Eastleigh High School.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a not so impressive year, having to sit out for the first half, then joining a club deep in relegation but together, we have united for a common cause which is to stay up and through the affliction we have faced as a club, we are hopeful of playing in top flight next year. The first leg was not impressive but we just want to do well in the remaining game and let God take care of the rest,&rdquo; he added.Abich&rsquo;s October performance caps the best run for Sofapaka in 2016 as the club&rsquo;s stand-in coach John Baraza also made it into the nominee&rsquo;s list for Coach of the Month Award. Their 0-1 loss to Sony Sugar, however, hampered his success chances but Abich stood out to emerge the best among players in the league.Abich made the three-man shortlist alongside Tusker defensive midfielder Hashim Sempala who has immensely helped the brewers plug a leaky back-line and the robustly sculptured Gor Mahia forward Enoch Agwanda. Other nominees were Allan Wanga, David Okelo (Tusker), Jared Obwoge (Chemelil Sugar), Sofapaka custodian Mathias Kigonya and Eric &lsquo;Marcelo&rsquo; Ouma (Gor Mahia).
