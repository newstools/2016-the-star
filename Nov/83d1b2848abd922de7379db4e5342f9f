State House is today expected to face the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly over queries raised by the Auditor General in his 2014-15 report.One of the queries involves the awarding of a new contract of Sh137 million for conversion of the mechanical workshop to offices.This was done without State House explaining a query in the 2012-13 audit report that said a different contractor may have been irregularly paid Sh88 million. The contract was for the construction of the mechanical workshop and petrol station at State House, but the project stalled . Although the matter was discussed before Public Accounts Committee, a decision was not made as the project was to be evaluated by the relevant technocrats to determine value for money, Auditor General Edward Ouko (pictured) said in the 2014-15 report. There were indications that the stalled project costing Sh88.8 million was demolished to pave way for the construction of another project, therefore, the value for money for the initial expenditure could not be confirmed in accordance with the Public Finance Management Act. Ouko also reported that records maintained by the presidency indicate bills amounting to Sh949 million relating to 2014-15 were not paid, but instead carried forward to 2015-16. Had these bills been paid, the financial statements would have reflected a deficit of Sh946.4 million instead of net surplus of Sh3.1 million now shown, the report said.
