Ninety boys in Nyeri county were traditionally inducted into manhood after undergoing an initiation ceremony according to Kikuyu culture. The climax of the ceremony was at Mount Kenya Ecosystem Centre, Abantu Lodge, Kieni East, on Saturday, when the boys were allowed to meet their parents after a two-week stay at the centre.The boys aged between 14 and 15 years are now prepared to become responsible citizens having taken through on importance of abiding by law.The head of Mwaki wa Rware group of Kikuyu elders, Gakuo Matu, said the event is special as it reminds people not to dump their culture.He said the boys were also taken through the tenets of adhering to school rules and not engaging in vices that have, in the past, led students to burn schools and damage property.Kiama Kia Ma head Kariuki Kabue said they, as Kikuyu elders, show young people the right things to do by supporting them during this crucial stage of life.Kieni MP Kanini Kega said that children do not have morals because of societal negligence. They should be guided to be good citizens, he said.Kega thanked the elders for guiding the boys through initiation and urged all members of society to also guide children to ensure so they can grow into upright adults."We have witnessed nasty incidences where students literally bring down their schools through fire. This is happening because the society has failed to teach these young adults how to live and behave well, he said.
