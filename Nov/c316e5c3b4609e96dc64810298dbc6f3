The High court yesterday dismissed an application by giant brewer East African Breweries to expunge some paragraphs from the defence filed by rival Keroche Breweries. Commercial Judge Fred Ochieng ruled the cited paragraphs touching on restrictive trade practices on EABL&rsquo;s part were not "oppressive, scandalous or immaterial" as alleged. The judge found that EABL and its Kenyan subsidiary Kenya breweries Ltd were erred in faulting Keroche for allegedly failing to produce satisfactory evidence to prove its claims against them. &ldquo;Keroche cannot be faulted for formulating its counterclaim in the manner it has chosen. The style may not meet the standards envisioned by EABL, but that is not reason enough to warrant the striking out of the paragraphs which the plaintiffs deem appropriate,&rdquo; he said. During the hearing, Keroche's lawyer M Karanja told the judge that the plea to strike out the contentious paragraphs was an attempt by EABL to avoid answering to the said allegations. EABL in its response through lawyer Anthony Njogu, however, claimed the sections depart from the real issues and digress to matters entirely unrelated to the issues at hand. EABL denied having a hand in &lsquo;slowly extinguishing Keroche by trade malpractices&rsquo; and instead challenged Keroche to provide any evidence to show that it is or has been involved in any unfair trade practices.
