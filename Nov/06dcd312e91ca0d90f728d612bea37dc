Kenya lacks data on the exact number of small-scale farmers, their acreage, production and the crops they grow.Agriculture CS Willy Bett yesterday said the lack of data makes it difficult to distribute government-subsidised fertiliser and seed. Many farmers are left out from the subsidies as they are not accounted for, he said. We are working with the county governments and chiefs to ensure bona fide farmers are registered so that government interventions go directly to these farmers, Bett said.He released the National Policy and Institutional Baseline Survey, which indicated poor coordination between the national and county governments. There is no monitoring and evaluation of the agriculture sector development, hence, the need for wide coordination to ensure growth and reduce duplication and waste of resources, it says. According to the African Development Bank, more than 75 per cent of agricultural outputs in Kenya are produced by smallholder farmers with farm sizes of 2.5 acres on average. They produce mainly for home consumption and use traditional methods.Less than four per cent of the land is irrigated. Major crops include cereals, root crops, bananas, pyrethrum, sisal, cut flowers and tobacco. Coffee, cotton, horticulture and tea are the main exports. Cattle and poultry dominate the livestock subsector, AfDB says.
