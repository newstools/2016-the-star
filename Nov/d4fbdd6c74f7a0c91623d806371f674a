Thirteen port and customs officials were charged on Wednesday with stealing cargo containers and aiding tax evasion on freight at the Mombasa port.A court in the county charged 10 men and three women on Wednesday with theft of cargo and "aiding procurement" of goods that had not gone through proper customs procedures.Also among the charges they faced was tampering with computerised customs systems.They denied all charges and were released on a bond of Sh500,000 each. The next hearing is on November 15.The 13 were arraigned as part of a drive to clamp down on corruption and boost efficiency at the hub.The port management said in February all transit cargo through Mombasa would be cleared in the port to curb tax evasion and smuggling.Previously, some containers heading beyond Kenya were cleared at private freight station outside the port.Mombasa acts as a trade gateway for much of East Africa. But neighbouring countries have often complained about corruption and the slow processing of cargo.The port replaced its managing director and five other senior managers in February as part of a wider bid to streamline customs procedures.
