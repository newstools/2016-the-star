UK-based televangelist Gilbert Deya of the controversial miracle babies scam has accused the DPP and police of using him to settle scores.An arrest warrant was issued for Deya in 2005 to face charges of five counts of child theft. Deya yesterday said the DPP and DCI&rsquo;s decision to reopen and institute criminal proceedings against him is &ldquo;a mere face-saving gimmick after they failed to secure the conviction of my wife&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is evident the matter is being used to settle scores and vilify me. It is because I refused to give into demands of bribes in order to have the investigations and prosecution halted,&rdquo; Deya said in court papers.He wants the High Court to dismiss the warrant of arrest against him. Justice Roselyn Aburili refused to certify the case urgent. The case will be heard on November 23.
