The Busia government will host the Lake Region Agribusiness Summit and Expo to promote social and economic development.Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday said the summit is in line with the objective of devolution to make services accessible.He said agriculture is a major pillar in the realisation of Vision 2030 and the counties should deliver efficient services.Fifteen counties in the Lake Victoria Basin, under the Lake Region Economic Bloc, are expected to participate in the Expo from November 28 to December 1.The governors of Bomet, Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kericho, Kisii, Kisumu, Migori, Nandi, Narok, Nyamira, Siaya, Trans Nzoia and Vihiga counties are expected to attend.Ojaamong, in an invitation letter, said the bloc has identified seven pillars to drive the economy, with agriculture being the key pillar.He said the county governments in the bloc will promote agribusiness to increase production, processing and value addition. If properly developed and managed as a business, agriculture has the potential of immensely transforming the economies of the counties and the people, Ojaamong said.The governor said the county, through participation in trade, will integrate the county economies into the regional and international markets. He said the counties have competitive advantages, including big populations.
