A Mombasa magistrate has ordered for prosecution of people involved in the blowing up of yacht suspected to have been used in drug trafficking.Chief magistrate Julius Nang&rsquo;ea said the vessel was blown up without court orders yet it was a crucial exhibit in the case.On April last year, the owner of MV Baby Iris, a British tycoon Clement Serge Bristol of Seychelles, who was the yacht's pilot, and Kenyans Ahmed Said Bakar, Mohamed Bakari Mohamed, Sharifu Mzee Mohamed and Ahmed Hussein Salim were charged with trafficking sh22 million heroin into the country.Nang&rsquo;ea ordered the director of public prosecution to investigate and bring to book everyone involved in the destruction of the yatch.This is a serious case and the ship was an exhibit that was in the custody of the court but it was blown up. The DPP should undertake the prosecution of those who torched the ship," said Nange'a.Early November,Nang&rsquo;ea withdrew from the case citing interference from the state and its departments.He accused the State of sanctioning unauthorized destruction of the yacht that was allegedly ferrying the drugs and the suspects on August 14 last year.However the Mombasa court head of magistrates Teresia Matheka ordered the file back to Nang&rsquo;ea.She further ordered the Nang&rsquo;ea to continue with the trials as he had already started."I am no longer comfortable hearing this case. The Executive's action, needless to say, strikes a huge blow against the rule of law by taking away key exhibit and destroying it without the authority of the court. The Executive showed disrespect to the court," he said.The destruction of the vessel was witnessed by president Uhuru Kenyatta and interior CS Joseph Nkaiserry in 2015.Defense counsel Jared Magolo said he is going to initiate criminal proceedings against Nkaiserry, Chief of Defense Forces Samson Mwathethe, Interior PS Monica Juma and Coast Regional Commissioner Nelson Marwa for presiding over the destruction of the luxurious boat.
