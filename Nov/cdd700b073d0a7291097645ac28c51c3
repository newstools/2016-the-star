A businessman in Wajir has been rebuked for allegedly threatening a blogger that he will use the anti-terror police unit to punish him.Siyad Hassan alias Siad Patni, a known businessman, was recorded in an audio clip where allegedly threatened to unleash officers from the unit on the blogger if he does not stop attacking him.This was after Nurdin Maalim - the blogger known for his critic of the Wajir County government - claimed in a Facebook post that the trader in collaboration with officials from the county "colluded" to misappropriate funds. Northeastern residents want the businessman held to account over the threats to the county critic citing a trend where powerful businessmen and politicians use the dreaded anti-terror unit to silence and intimidate those who point out their ills.The businessman has been organising soccer tournaments, which he said is aimed at fighting radicalisation and violent extremism among the youth.The latest event was attended by Northeastern regional coordinator, Mohamud Saleh, Harambee Stars coach Stanley Okumbi and Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi.The blogger alleged that the events are used as a conduit to "defraud" the county government and that some Sh150 million meant to fight radicalisation has been siphoned from the county coffers."I don't like whatever has been written on your page. I just don't want to be told later that the guy has been taken away by ATPU, has gone missing and I am responsible (sic)," the infuriated businessman is heard saying during a phone call."I know how to fix him through ATPU. If I get angry, I will take action. I know how to frame him. I will only say he is against anti-radicalisation and he will be finished," he added.The matter has since been reported to Nairobi Area Police Station under occurrence book number 6/16/11/2016.Hassan denied making the threats. When contacted, Police spokesperson Charles Owino neither received calls nor replied to SMS sent by the Star.In January, a critic of a sitting MP from Mandera was arrested in Eastleigh on alleged link to terrorism and extremism.He was later released without any charges leveled against him. It later appeared the MP "sponsored" ATPU officers to "teach the man a lesson".
