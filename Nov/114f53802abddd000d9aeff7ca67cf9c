Bomet MCAs on Wednesday adjourned proceedings to discuss the upsurge in political hooliganism. Ndarawetta MCA Josphat Kirui filed a motion of urgent importance, saying rising political intolerance if unchecked will degenerate into anarchy.Governor Isaac Rutto says he was hit by a tear gas canister on Sunday during a football match that turned chaotic at Silibwet. He was flown to Nairobi and transferred to South Africa on Tuesday for nose surgery.Protests have erupted and residents have demanded the transfer of county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai.Rutto has blamed police who were separating rival groups and forced to use teargas. Police have defended their crowd control efforts. The public spat and utterances by leaders are likely to disrupt peaceful coexistence, especially as campaigns are building up, Kirui said. He said the grave matter requires serious deliberation. There is a rise in terror gangs linked with politicians, which perpetrate hooliganism, Kirui said.The session was marred by a bitter exchange of words between members from Jubilee and those allied to Rutto. The governor s allies stormed out of the House. They accused the speaker of favouritism for giving Jubilee members more time to speak.Nyangores MCA Andrew Maritim accused police of taking political sides. He said the officers provide security to political rallies organised by Jubilee politicians but ignore other parties, such as Rutto s Chama Cha Mashinani.But Embomos MCA Robert Serbia said Rutto has himself to blame because he tends to disrupt his opponents rallies. Kembu s Julius Korir and Bernard Ngeno of Kapletundo said Rutto s action at Silibwet was an act of lawlessness. They said he should have followed proper channels in seeking answers to allegations youths had been arrested for trying to disrupt the function.
