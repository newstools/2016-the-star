Donald Trump has moved to unite a divided Republican Party behind him by giving two former bitter critics both women key posts in his government.After days in which he has alarmed many Americans by offering top jobs to a string of controversial conservatives whose only qualification appeared to be loyalty to him, Trump appeared to hold out an olive branch with his latest choices.In what was seen as a nod to diversity after a run of choosing only older, white men, he has asked Nikki Haley, the Indian-American Republican governor of South Carolina, to be the US ambassador to the United Nations.Betsy DeVos, a billioniare Republican donor and schools reformer, has been named education secretary.In a third appointment that signalled a change of direction, Trump has indicated he wants Ben Carson, an African-American retired brain surgeon who challenged him for the Republican nomination, to be secretary of housing and urban development.All three are conservatives but they are far more mainstream than the people including right-winger Steve Bannon and hardline senator Jeff Sessions already chosen for Trump s White House administration.Read: Trump has not offered Ben Carson US housing post - spokesmanHaley, 44, born Nimrata Randhawa to Sikh immigrants, is the youngest US governor and a rising star of a party whose leaders feel they must do more to appeal to ethnic minorities. She made headlines after she demanded the removal of the Confederate flag long linked with white racists from South Carolina s State House after black churchgoers were massacred in a shooting.Miss DeVos, 58, has antagonised teachers unions by becoming one of America s most vociferous supporters of school choice, championing publicly-funded but independent charter schools.She and Haley both opposed Trump during the election campaign. Haley described him as "everything a governor doesn t want in a president" and, only a month ago, said she was "not a fan".DeVos dismissed him as an "interloper" who "doesn t represent the Republican Party". Like other former Republican opponents, both women have since been reconciled to a Trump presidency. Like Haley, Ben Carson has little relevant experience for his new post.Trump is reportedly poised to make an even bigger concession to his Republican enemies and appoint Mitt Romney as his Secretary of State. Romney called Trump a "phony" and a "fraud" during the election campaign.But he is regarded as a safe choice to steer US foreign policy, unlike his rival for the job, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose controversial business links with foreign countries mean Congress may refuse to confirm his appointment.
