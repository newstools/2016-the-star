President Uhuru Kenyatta is tomorrow expected to address the East African Legislative Assembly as the MPs to the regional Parliament raise concerns of underfunding.The five EAC partner states owe the EALA Sh3.3 billion, a situation which speaker Daniel Kidega says has affected operations. The matter is so critical that the assembly and a number of institutions and organs cancelled or reduced activities, Kidega said last week at Parliament Buildings. The report on the status of contributions says Burundi has the highest debt of Sh1.14 billion, which has piled up since 2015-16.Uganda owes the assembly the least, with Sh94.1 million arrears.Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania have arrears of Sh612.3 million, Sh649 million and Sh796.8 million respectively. The remission by partner states up to date paints a less than positive picture. In this regard , I appeal to partner states to make their full remittances by December as agreed by the Council of Ministers, Kidega added.
