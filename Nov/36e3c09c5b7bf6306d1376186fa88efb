National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi his Ndamata clan of the Mbeere community and Kambas in endorsing Runyenjes legislator Sicily Mbarire for Embu governor.Muturi, a bitter rival of Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti, chaired an indoor clan meeting in Embu on Saturday, from which the press was locked out.It was attended by more than 400 men. Women are traditionally not allowed to attend such meetings.Muturi declined to speak to the press about the meeting. Mbeere North MP Charles Njagagua and Embu speaker Justus Mate were at the meeting.Sources said participants censured Kivuti, who is from the Murure Clan of the Mbeere, for entering the governor race.Kivuti and Mbarire had joined hands to face Embu Governor Martin Wambora for the seat next year, but they later split.Wambora has large support from the Embu community, who voted for him in large numbers in 2013, and also from large sections of the Mbeere clans.Sources from the meeting said Kivuti was blamed for perpetuating historical injustices, where his clan has continually sidelined the Ndamata clan since the leadership of former minister Jeremiah Nyagah.The members allegedly said they were endorsing Mbarire to comply with an MoU that Mbeere and Embu elders agreed on before the last general election. It is alleged the elders agreed that the governor post should go to the Embu community who are the majority and the one of senator to the Mbeere community.Mate accused Kivuti of creating antagonism between the Mbeere and Embu communities by declaring his interest in the governor post, despite the MoU which he is allegedly aware of.The clan will prevent animosity with the Embu by supporting Mbarire, an Embu, to face off with Wambora.It was agreed that a 10-member committee will be formed to engage Mbarire in structured pre-election negotiations for sharing of power and resources equitably with the Mbeere and other communities in the county. Participants agreed that since the Ndamata clan are the majority in Mbeere subcounties and the Kambas are more than 57,000, if they are mobilised they will beat Kivuti who allegedly has the support of the 33,000 Murure clan members, sources said.During the meeting, Muturi allegedly accepted to be the patron of Ndamata clan after pressure was exerted on him to take up the mantle.This comes a week after the Mbeere Council of elders confirmed Kivuti s endorsement to run for governor by seeking the community s 39 subclans consent at a holy shrine.More than 3,000 representatives of the 39 Mbeere subclans legitimised the council s decision of endorsing Kivuti at Kwa Rumbia holy shrine in Mbeere North on October 22.Traditionally, all decisions of the community are made at the shrine.Elders' chairman Eston Nyagah said they blessed hKivuti as he was the most suitable leader from the community to lead the county.
