First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has praised young people using art to send messages of hope and unity and fight the ills afflicting Kenyan society. Through art, we have an opportunity and responsibility to speak out against the deplorable killing of our wildlife, Kenyatta said. She spoke on Thursday when she presided over the opening of Davina Dobie Art Exhibition at the Tribe Hotel in Nairobi. It s evident art has the power to unite people in a shared journey of aesthetic appreciation and interpretation, Kenyatta said. It challenges conventional thinking through creativity and innovation, and inspires us to reimagine our world by seeing not just what is, but also what could be.
