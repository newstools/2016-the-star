Bandari FC have vowed to beat Ulinzi Stars and finish the Sportspesa Premier League in a respectable ninth position when they travel to Nakuru this weekend.While saying the team board of management was happy with the team&rsquo;s second leg performance, Bandari FC technical director Edward Oduor said it was their intentionto finish the season on a high. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate we didn&rsquo;t finish in the top eight but we&rsquo;re happy with our second leg rally which saw the team lose only three games out of the fifteen games they played. We believe next year will even be better,&rdquo; he said. Oduor explained that the stand-in coach Kennedy Odhiambo had taken a bit longer to understand the players and their best playing position and this made the team lose matches they could have easily won.Oduor said the youthful players who were given more playing time in the second leg, had earned their place in the team and will form the integral part of the team next year.
