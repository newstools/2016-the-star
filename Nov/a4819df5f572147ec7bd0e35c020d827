Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has accused the government of initiating the medical equipment supply project to steal at least Sh35 billion from the public.Mudavadi said the project saw the supply of leased imaging, dialysis, theatre and ICU machines to two hospitals in every county.He said no funds have been released for the machines since the project was launched in 2014, and that taxpayers have been forced to pay Sh5 billion each year for them.Read: Counties Sh200m medical equipmentAlso read: Senate to probe Sh38bn health kits for countiesMudavadi claimed "secretive agreements" were aimed at creating a monopoly to benefit a cartel of local leaders and suppliers "who are minting profits from county governments through inflated prices".He said the cost of the equipment has been transferred to Kenyans seeking treatment, most of whom now cannot afford it. A major scandal is on the horizon even as the Jubilee government mounts a cover-up excursive trying to explain the Sh5.3 billion heist from the Ministry of Health," he said in a statement on Friday.Mudavadi said Jubilee needed to address the matter urgently and carry out a thorough forensic audit on the "forced" deal with counties.The politician asked the government to give the details of agreements with various companies for the lease of the machines. Has the equipment been successfully installed? If so, do they have sufficiently trained staff manning them, knowing at the time of the lease agreement, the county had only 27 kidney specialists and nine vascular surgeons? he asked.He addressed a press conference at Ndovu House in Shela on the second day of his tour of Lamu county.Read: Sh38 billion medical equipment lying idle as nurses not trained -Nurses associationMudavadi also wanted to know if counties were getting value for the Sh5 billion they will allegedly pay every year for seven years. He said some of the equipment many be lying idle for lack of personnel qualified to operate it.He also asked if the manufacturers and suppliers of the machines rightfully earned Sh10 billion in the last two years.The politician further asked the government to reveal who one Mr Macharia of Seven Seas IT Company was and if he was the one given the contract to supply imaging equipment from General Electric in the US. Is this Mr Macharia in any way related to the former Health Cabinet Secretary who is now Transport and Infrastructure CS?" he asked.Mudavadi also named another beneficiary as Mrs Matu of Anjelica Company, saying she was the only one given the contract for dialysis equipment and consumables from Belco company in Italy. On the issue of inflated pricing, why is the price of imaging films and dialysis consumables from sole supplier Anjelica Sh36,000 and Sh4,500, while the open market fetches Sh17,000 and Sh3,000 respectively? he asked.The presidential aspirant also mentioned Richard Ngatia of Megascope Company, claiming he got the contract for supplying theatre equipment from Mindray Company of china.He asked if this was the same Ngatia featuring prominently in the Sh5.3 billion Health ministry scandal.Read: Lifecare Medics deny 'Mafya House' scandal link, vow to continue working with governmentAlso read: CS Mailu alleges auditor may have 'double counted' in Sh5.3bn scamLamu Governor Issa Timamy, who also attended the press conference, said he signed for the equipment but was yet to receive it from the national government.He said the county was still setting up the infrastructure but that the matter of personnel left a lot to be desired.
