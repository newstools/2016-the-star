Kenya Ports Authority managing director Catherine Muturi has received support from the presidency as she fights cartels who want to remove her.Insiders told the Star cartels are scheming to fix the MD because she is a threat to them. We know there are cartels at the port which are hatching plots to remove Mturi. Those are kicks of a dying horse. They will not succeed. I am fully behind Mturi, said former Kisauni MP Ananiah Mwaboza.Mwaboza, an adviser in the Office of the Deputy President, said the cartel is trying to use former and current MPs from Coast to implicate Mturi in a major corruption scandal.He said the politicians are trying to influence employment of their people, who they use to influence irregular business transactions. We will do whatever is needed to ensure she cleans that port, Mwaboza said before flying out to Morocco for a 10-day UN Climate Change conference.The former MP, who is gunning for the Mombasa governor seat, has vowed to ensure the port is 100 per cent corruption free if he clinches the seat in 2017.
