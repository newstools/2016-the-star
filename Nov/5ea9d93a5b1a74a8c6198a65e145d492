Residents of Mutithi ward in Kirinyaga county on Thursday evening marched to the National Irrigation Board offices in Mwea to demand compensation for their land.The national government acquired land for the construction of the Rukenya Dam.The residents said they surrendered their title deeds to the state but are yet to be compensated Sh3.5 billion, almost a year after the project began. We don t know who has pocketed our money. All we hear are empty promises. We are ready to demonstrate at the President s office in Nairobi. This government listens and acts when people go to the streets to demand their rights, a resident said.The project will double the acreage of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme from 24 acres to 48.It has been plagued by controversy.The project, funded by the Japanese government, is estimated to cost Sh18 billion. In June, Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa toured the site and assured residents they would be compensated within a month.In April, coordinator of the Resettlement Implementation Unit Julius Mutuaruchiu said the residents would be compensated by May.Officials from the Mwea Irrigation Scheme were not available for comment or to address the demonstrators.Residents were to be compensated Sh750,000 per acre. More than 620 families were involved and another 1,000 families in another phase.
