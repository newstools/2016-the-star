All we hear are empty promises. We are ready to demonstrate at the President&rsquo;s office in Nairobi. &ldquo;This government listens and acts when people go to the streets to demand their rights,&rdquo; a resident said.The project will double the acreage of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme from 24 acres to 48.It has been plagued by controversy.The project, funded by the Japanese government, is estimated to cost Sh18 billion.
