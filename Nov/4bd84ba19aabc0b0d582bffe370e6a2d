National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has been censured for leading his clan and Kambas in endorsing Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire for Embu governor.Democratic Party national organising secretary Njagih Kumantha accused Muturi of taking the county backwards by trying to divide the people along clan lines. The criticism has also been voiced on the Embu Reformist WhatsApp group.Kumantha, chairman of the Mwariama Council of Elders, said as a national leader, Muturi should not support any clan.He said if a candidate supported by a certain clan wins, there would be favouritism in appointments.Kumantha said this would create conflicts. In my view, which is the view of the common mwananchi, clanism is not the way to go in seeking proper leadership for the county, he said.Kumantha said churches have been trying to end clanism.He said in 2014, it was agreed during a meeting at Nyangwa in Mbeere North that people should cultivate unity.He said clanship has for many years contributed to lack of development in Mbeere subcounties.The Embu Reformist Youth Group, urged National Cohesion and Integration Commission chairman Francis ole Kaparo to investigate Muturi for creating disharmony in the county.The group, led by Runyenjes Central MCA Steve Munene, said Muturi s action is retrogressive, divisive, unacceptable, and highly motivated by greed.The members held a press conference at Izaak Walton Inn, Embu.Leaders include Eliud Njiru, Pius Kimanthi, Fredrick Nyagah, Erick Tippis, Ambrose Njeru and Cathleen Gakii.They said clan meetings will create animosity and divide the residents, hurting development.The members demanded an apology from Muturi or they mobilise residents to demonstrate.They were reacting to reports that Muturi chaired a day-long meeting at Mountain Breeze Hotel in Embu on Saturday, which endorsed Mbarire.Sources told the Star Mbeere North MP Charles Njagagua, Embu speaker Justus Mate and Knut Mbeere branch executive secretary Dickson Murunguma were present.The source said the meeting said Senator Lenny Kivuti should not be in the governor's race because he comes from the Murure Clan of the Mbeere community.They said it is important for their clan to support Mbarire to take over from Governor Martin Wambora because he has failed.
