Floor crossing and party hopping have been
hitting the headlines. This piece looks only at floor crossing (only possible
for a member of a legislature). Expressions such as “rebels”, “expulsion” and
“losing seats” have been prominent.  A vision of a reformed party system  The constitution drafters aimed at a
transformation of the party system. The Constitution of Kenya Review Commission’s
draft list of national goals, values and principles in 2002 included “Political
parties shall observe democratic principles in their internal organization and
procedures, respect the rights of others to participate in the political
process, and avoid violence and bribery.” The commission’s image of a political party included
their having the function of fostering democratic processes and popular
participation in the political process. Parties were to  mobilize public opinion and encourage
national values and a national outlook. They were to “organize people with
similar views and interests for political activities”. They should be means for
public opinion to be brought to bear on government policies, and to hold
government accountable. And their roles included ensuring that “cohesion and
discipline in the conduct of public affairs” were maintained. Behind this was the idea that political parties
should resemble those you find in so-called developed democracies, like the
Republican and Democratic parties in the US, Conservatives, Labour and
Liberal-Democrats in the UK, and so on. These, and most other parties in the
same countries, are identified with specific approaches to national, and world,
problems. They have ideologies and ideas. For elections, they publish plans for
what they would do in office. These will be (generally) consistent with their
overall approaches, covering, for the main parties, national policies and
concrete  proposals on a wide range of
national and international issues. There was an assumption by constitution makers
that you are more likely to get policies —and action—out of parties that have
some stability, with thinkers, and an accumulation of experience. The CKRC’s explicit vision disappeared, but
underlies provisions in the current Constitution. Parties must have a “national
character”, including not being “founded on a religious, linguistic, racial,
ethnic, gender or regional basis”. They must have internal democracy, and
promote national unity, as well as respecting human rights, and everyone’s right
to participate in politics. And they must not engage in or encourage violence,  or have any paramilitary force, encourage
hatred of others, practise corruption, or use public resources, unless the law
allows. Constitutional mechanisms to encourage
democratic, policy focussed, inclusive, non-tribalistic and effective parties
include ensuring fair use of broadcasting time, 
and the allocation of public money to parties to discourage corruption
and misuse of other public resources and audit of parties.  Floor crossing rules  The idea of party discipline, to maintain the
stability of parties, and consistency of practice in line with policies and
ideologies, is supported by Article 103 of the Constitution. This says that a
member of either house  of Parliament who
was elected for a party loses the seat if he or she “resigns from that party or
is deemed to have resigned”. A person elected as an independent loses their
seat on joining a party. The main underlying idea of provisions like
this is that a person who stood for election apparently committed to a party
and its policies should not be able to abandon those commitments without
seeking support for the people who elected him or her.  Kenyan realities  There is some unreality to this in the Kenyan
situation. Policies do not seem important. True, parties have elections manifestoes.
How many people read them (including candidates)? In 2013 a satirical
commentator (Waga Odongo) in the Daily Nation observed “There is a chasm
between the Kenya we live in and the Kenya with projects and schemes that
politicians constantly promise us on slideshows. Nobody should believe a word
that was said or what will happen in these manifestoes.” Sometimes it seems that all parties represent
is the interests of their leaders. But, if a person was elected because she
supported Raila, should she retain the seat if now she is committed to
supporting Uhuru? What value did the votes of the majority have? If people
voted for CORD they voted for another view and voice in Parliament than that of
Jubilee. Of course, if all the electorate really expects
from MPs is the CDF properly spent, it hardly matters what party they belong
to. But the role of MPs under the Constitution is not to spend the CDF but to work
hard at ensuring that good laws are passed, the government is accountable, and
policies make sense.  Other countries’ efforts  Various countries have tried to curb floor
crossing by legislators (a 2007 study showed laws in 41 countries, mostly newer
democracies). The case for banning it seems particularly strong in countries
where voters vote for a party list, and not for a particular person to represent
their area. In such systems, disqualifying the MP does not lead to a
by-election: the next on the list takes the seat. But laws on floor crossing are not found only
in countries with such election systems. India, Nigeria, Malawi and Singapore
are countries with single member constituency systems but with anti-defection
laws (as the Indians call them). Floor-crossing is less of an issue than it
would have been if those MPs in Naivasha in 2010 had not changed our system to
a presidential one. In a parliamentary system (like India) floor crossing to
the opposition may lead to a vote of no confidence against the government. In
Kenya, now, the President cannot be removed by a simple majority of MPs. He remains
in power unless a rather complex process culminating in a two-thirds majority
in the Senate is gone through. The arguments for and against In fact, crossing to government, rather than
away from it, is the current issue. One motive for anti-floor crossing laws is precisely
to discourage tendencies towards a one-party state that defection to government
may reflect. Other arguments in favour point to need for party discipline, and
fears of bribery, and that rampant floor-crossing undermines voters’ faith in
the system. Arguments against anti-floor crossing laws include
MP’s rights of conscience, the desirability of encouraging internal party
debate (rather than squashing it by the threat of expulsion) as well the expense
of by-elections.  How is a seat lost?  Under the Political Parties Act, a party member
(not just an MP) who joins another party (except through a merger or coalition
of parties), is treated as having resigned. The exception for mergers is very
recent. A member who “promotes the ideology, interests or policies of another
party” is also to be assumed to have resigned. The party abandoned must tell
the Registrar of Political Parties within seven days (this time limit was added
in July), and the Registrar must remove the person from the party membership
list. Then, presumably, if an MP, the person loses his or her seat—under the
Constitution. But when CORD recently wrote to the Registrar,
it seems they were saying the members were expelled, not “deemed to have
resigned”. Expulsion from a party should occur only if the member infringes the
party’s constitution and after a fair hearing within the party. But assumed
resignation and expulsion seem to be treated as the same thing. The Registrar has developed procedures: not
only the party, but anyone may complain that a member should be treated as
having resigned. A court case might lead to the same result. Incidentally, our rules about defection do not
seem to apply to Governors and Members of County Assemblies . The old Constitution also provided that party
defectors would lose their seats. But it seems this never happened. Parties may
have been afraid of admitting they had lost members, or were perhaps fearful of
court actions (common in other countries). The situation —and the law—is a bit confusing.
