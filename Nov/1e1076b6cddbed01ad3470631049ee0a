The Nairobi county government will partner with a life-changing, community-based organisation in Kibera to expand its reach. Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said the county will market Shining Hope For Communities products and award it tenders. Shofco is a non-profit organisation that runs a fully equipped hospital, a school and water projects. It empowers women and the youth through a number of programmes. This group is really transforming lives here. Our mothers are being empowered. They manufacture keyholders made of beads, train the youth and women in computer literacy, Mueke said. He visited the facility last Friday. Mueke said the county will supply its health facility with drugs and medical equipment. Chief executive Kennedy Odede said the health facility serves more than 300 people daily. It has a sexual abuse rehabilitation centre.
