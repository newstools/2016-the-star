Real estate magnate David Ngari, popularly known as Gakuyo, has joined the race for Kiambu governor five months to the Jubilee Party primaries.He says he will give incumbent William Kabogo and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu a run for their money. The three, Njoki Gathendu and Gakuru Kanyanja all want to run for governor on the Jubilee ticket.Speaking on Saturday in Munyu, Thika, Gakuyo said his competitors lack servant leadership.The county s top job needs a candidate with sound managerial skills to properly manage resources for economic growth, he said.Gakuyo said his ability to lead the county to prosperity is evident from the way he has led Gakuyo Real Estate as the CEO and Ekeza Sacco as the chairman. Bad leadership has been the main reason why Kiambu has lagged behind in development. Kiambu people want change and the time is now to put the county leadership in the right hands, he said.Gakuyo said the several fights between Kabogo and Waititu have given Kiambu a bad name.The two have been embroiled in a bitter political rivalry as each seek to outshine each other and endear themselves to voters. They are embroiled in a court battle over academic qualifications.
