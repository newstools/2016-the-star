Boda boda operators yesterday said they will continue operating within the city centre until their case filed in the High Court is determined. In October last year, the operators asked the court to bar the county from evicting them from the CBD. The case was dismissed on October 17 this year.Boda boda riders&rsquo; chairman Ken Onyango told the Star they have appealed against the court&rsquo;s decision at the High Court. It will be heard on December 2. &ldquo;We insist that the status quo remains. We will operate from the CBD, because we have challenged the decision of the court,&rdquo; Onyango said. The operators said they have been paying a monthly levy of Sh3,000 each and there is no reason to remove them from the CDB. They have also accused the county of failing to adhere to the law requiring designated spaces where motorcycles can operate. It was passed in 2014 by the National Assembly.
