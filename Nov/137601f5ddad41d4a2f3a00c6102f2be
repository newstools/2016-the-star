Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has slammed the Jubilee administration for diverting the country's attention by trying to attack Cord counties over corruption.This comes after Majority Leader Aden Duale said Cord counties have been facilitating coalition leader Raila Odinga's travel expenses and rallies.Abdullahi dismissed Duale, terming his sentiments as malicious and false."The fight against corruption should not be politicised where Jubilee and Cord are pointing fingers at each other, making counties a new platform for trolling," he said on Saturday.Abdullahi said devolution is Raila's brainchild, adding that he would not jeopardise the same.Raila defended Cord governors after audit reports were released indicating that counties have lost millions of funds allocated to them in the 2014/2015 budget.Auditor General Edward Ouko said most the funds have been lost through irregular procurement of goods and services in counties.More on this: Auditor General queries Sh2bn undocumented expenses in Wajir countyCouncil of Governors chairman Peter Munya raised an alarm of money being through IFMIS from nine counties.Abdullahi said a forensic audit of IFMIS needs to be conducted since all the passwords are created and controlled by the national government at Treasury.More on this: EACC, Treasury to audit IFMIS for 'loopholes' used to steal taxpayer moneyKilifi Governor Amason Kingi dismissed 10 county officials after their IFMIS passwords were traced to the theft of Sh51 million from the county's Health department.
