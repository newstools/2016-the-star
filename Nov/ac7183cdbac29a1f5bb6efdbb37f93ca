County governments should get an extra Sh70 billion in the 2017-18 financial year, the Commission on Revenue Allocation has said. It has recommended that the counties get Sh367.5 billion, 35 per cent of the Sh1.03 trillion the government collected as revenue in the 2014-15 financial year.This year, the counties were allocated Sh298.3 billion, 32 per cent of the 2014-15 government revenue. The equitable share to the counties, CRA says in its report, should be Sh331.5 billion, while Sh35.9 billion should be provided as conditional grants.Of the Sh35.9 billion, CRA says Sh27 billion should go to current allocations, including level five hospitals (Sh4 billion), free maternal healthcare (Sh4.1 billion) and leasing of medical equipment (Sh4.5 billion).Counties are also to get 15 per cent of the Road Fuel Levy Fund, which is Sh13.2 billion and Sh200 million special purpose grant for emergency medical services. The CRA, however, said the 15 per cent fuel levy is not adequate to maintain the 121,456km of roads assigned to county governments.
