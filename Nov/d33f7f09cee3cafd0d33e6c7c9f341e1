Resources, one&rsquo;s political party and the influence of Mombasa political bigwigs will play a crucial role in determining who will be elected in Mombasa next year.Political analysts say many aspirants are seeking the support of local political bigwigs, endorsement from parties and enough resources for their campaigns.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and Senator Hassan Omar are among top politicians sought after by aspirants who will be going for the MP and MCA posts. Joho commands authority in ODM, whereas Awiti and Omar lead the Wiper Party.Don&rsquo;t ignore ruling partyPolitical analyst Yusuf Abubakar said the Jubilee Party cannot be overruled because of the early campaign by President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s foot soldiers.&ldquo;National politics will play a crucial role at the county and constituency level,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If Cord disintegrates due to a presidential flagbearer, Jubilee might clinch more seats in Mombasa and Coast at large.&rdquo;A fierce political battle is expected at the constituency level as the six posts in Mombasa have attracted an average of eight candidates each.ODM, Wiper and Jubilee are poised to share the Mvita, Kisauni, Changamwe, Jomvu, Likoni and Nyali seats, depending on their campaign strategies and the mobilised resources, Abubakar said.Taita Taveta University College principal Prof Hamadi Boga said, &ldquo;It is common sense that a political party that has a huge following and a candidate&rsquo;s resources will help get leaders elected.&rdquo;Newcomers in politics are fighting to get the attention of the electorates and big politicians.Battle for reelectionBut incumbents are also working tirelessly to ensure they appease the electorates who voted for them in the March 4, 2013, general election by implementing projects, as they want to be reelected.In Kisauni, Joho&rsquo;s ally MP Rashid Bedzimba, who has three opponents so far, is confident he will win.The Nyali seat is up for grabs after Awiti declared he will run for governor, complicating Omar&rsquo;s bid as they are both from Wiper.More than 12 aspirants have launched intensive campaigns for the seat, among them Mombasa assembly speaker Thaddeus Rajwayi, KTN journalist Mohamed Ali, businessmen Saidi Abdhalla (Saido), Simon Adalla, Chrispinus Waithaka, Mark Ouma and Asharaf Bayusuf.Saido, Ali and Rajwayi are seeking ODM endorsement, Adalla and Ouma want to run on the Wiper ticket and Bayusuf wants the Jubilee ticket.&ldquo;In Nyali, the battle is expected to be between Wiper and ODM. This is due to the fact that Cord, as a coalition, is very strong in the region and the current MP is from Wiper,&rdquo; Abubakar said.In Mvita, the battle will be between Jubilee and ODM because MP Abdulswamad Nassir (ODM) will be contesting against Mohamed Tenge.The same will be witnessed in Likoni, where the current MP Masoud Mwahima, who decamped to the Jubilee Party, will be facing woman representative Mishi Mboko and Suleiman Shakombo (ODM), both fronted by Joho.In Jomvu and Changamwe, the race will be between ODM and Wiper, but a Jubilee candidate stands a chance if Cord fails to play its cards well, Abubakar said.
