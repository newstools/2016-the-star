Woodley Estate residents in Nairobi have accused Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and senior county officials of illegally evicting tenants and allocating their houses to other occupants. In the house allocated to his chief of staff, it was a case of breaking and entering, since the house was fully paid for in advance for one year, chairman Sam Gachago told the press yesterday.He claimed there will be a mass eviction and the houses will be given to senior county officials. Gachago said they have lived on the estate for more than 50 years and will not move.The county has embarked on a project to demolish old one-storey houses and replace them with multi-storey houses to accommodate more people and economise on space. It will build more than 100,000 housing units in Woodley, Dagoretti and parts of Eastlands.Nairobi Housing executive Chris Khaemba said, What we are doing in the area is part of the expansive urban renewal that we are carrying out in other parts of the city... After the renewal, the affected residents will be the first to be considered [to occupy the new houses].
