Thirty thousand Kenyans are at risk of deportation from the United States after President-elect Donald Trump enters office on January 20, 2017.  They are illegal immigrants and President-elect Trump pledged to rid the US of all unregistered foreigners on Sunday. What is to be done? Government Spokesman Eric Kiraithe remarked yesterday that the state does not take anyone anywhere on an illegal basis, signalling that the Jubilee administration has washed its hands of the 30,000. Those who have committed crimes among these Kenyans should not expect a warm welcome back, but the rest of them deserve a second chance and the skills and expertise they have acquired in their years in the US could come in useful. Kenyan Diaspora remittances from the US are our largest source of foreign exchange. It is regrettable that so many Kenyans should be expelled from America in one fell swoop. But they should expect no preferential treatment.
