Kiambu Governor William Kabogo yesterday dismissed reports the county lost money through irregular payments.In a statement to media houses, he faulted the press for reporting the county lost Sh359.5 million through duplication of receipts in revenue collection, though auditors acknowledged financial systems caused the duplication error.&ldquo;The auditors were taken through the systems. At no point in their report did they say that money was lost. We therefore wish to clarify that there was no revenue loss as reported by the media,&rdquo; he said in response to released 2014-15 financial year audit report.Kabogo said out that Sh328 million variances in payroll figures raised by auditors were government contributions to the NSSF and employee social benefits that are usually paid outside the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Database. &ldquo;With regard to claim that Sh149 million was reallocated without approval, we wish to confirm that the county&rsquo;s supplementary budget containing the reallocation was passed by the County Assembly in June 2015,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo added they also sought approval from the Controller of Budget.
