Three water pans will be excavated in Fafi and Ijara subcounties, two areas worst hit by drought. The Kenya Agricultural Productivity Programme launched the excavation yesterday.Coordinator Jelle Ibrahim said it will take at least a month for the three pans to fill with water. He urged the community to fence the water pans to keep away animals. The programme is meant to build the resilience of the people so that they can develop their own coping mechanisms and utilise natural resources, he said.Agriculture executive Sophia Omar urged residents to plant vegetables and fruit trees. She said the pans will each contain 20,000 cubic metres of water. Omar said the government will build a few dams for fish farming.The two spoke at Ruqa water pan, where Jelle launched excavation. The project will cost Sh4.6 million. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Hamey said the water pans will improve livelihoods as they will serve livestock as well. The youth and women will have more time to do things other than thinking of where to get water for domestic use and their animals. The pan is unique because it owned by the people and looked after by the people, he said.
