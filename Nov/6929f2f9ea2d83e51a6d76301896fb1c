Chaos erupted at Kilifi county assembly on Tuesday when two executive members refused to provide crucial information to the Special General Oversight Committee.When the committee started, county secretary Owen Baya refused to take oath leading to a confrontation between him and the committee chair Jimmy Kahindi.Baya then took oath while seated, without holding a Bible and affirmed that the information he was about to give was the truth and "God should help him".Kahindi noted that it was disrespectful to take oath before God while seated.Baya was to be interrogated on issues of revenue projection of Sh1.4 billion.Shortly after, chief Finance officer Ben Chilumo declined to submit a report with details on how revenue collected before devolution for comparison with current collection by the county government.Chilumo said that the county secretary wanted him to make a preliminary statement before releasing the report.But Kahini insisted that he inform the house about the report before giving his 'boss' a chance to address the assembly.This went on for more than one-and-a-half hours as MCAs threatened to 'deal with' Baya and Chilumo for messing up county funds.At some point, Kibarani MCA Gertrude Mbeyu angrily told the assembly that the county officials are incompetent."Last week I told you these guys are incompetent, some MCAs defenced them. I said they should step aside because they cannot give information since we notified them a month ago," she said.She also accused Baya of misleading the county government since he took office.An Administration police officer guides Kilifi county secretary Owen Baya's vehilce when he left the county assembly through the back door after meeting turned chaotic on November 29, 2016. /ALPHONCE GARIMCAs threatened to take physical action against Baya and Chilumo for what they termed as arrogance on the officials' part.Watamu rep Ibrahim Matumbo threw a mobile phone at Chilumo, which hit his shoulder, as he was being whisked out by the Sergeant at Arms.Other officials taken to safety were Mahenzo Dzombo, as well as the director of revenue Alfred Dena.Matumbo accused Baya and Chilumo of looting public funds and disrespecting the legislators."We are prepared, wananchi are waiting for answers out there.
