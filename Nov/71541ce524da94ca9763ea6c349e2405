Deputy President William Ruto has accused the opposition of teaming up with fraudsters to attack the Jubilee administration. On Saturday, he said the Jubilee administration has achieved much compared to previous regimes. Speaking in Matungu, Kakamega county, Ruto said some unscrupulous people have now joined hands with the opposition to attack the government.He said Cord leader Raila Odinga, ANC s Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper s Kalonzo Musyoka have served in government for many years, but they achieved little during their tenure. I served for only two years as a minister, but Kalonzo and Mudavadi had served for more than 30 years, and Raila over 20 years, Ruto said. He was accompanied by MPs Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and the host, David Were.
