Senators yesterday asked the House Labour and Social Welfare Committee to investigate whether the National Construction Authority approved the renovation of the collapsed Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega county.Senators Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), George Khaniri (Vihiga) and John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot) also want the county government to provide a list of the tender advertisement for the renovation of the stadium, the corresponding firms that bid and those that were awarded.A section of the stadium being renovated at a cost of Sh1 billion collapsed on Saturday as Mahiakalo MCA Cleophas Malala claimed the county was rushing through development projects so it could refer to them in 2017 campaigns.Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) launched the project last June.Wilkori Building and Civil Engineering Company won the tender. Wilkori is the company which refurbished Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret.The renovation was to be done in five phases with the first phase costing Sh399 million and expected to be completed by December. The entire project was to be finished by August 2017. The collapse might interfere with the completion of the first phase.The project had stalled last year, less than a month after it s launch, over alleged financial constraints.Khalwale, who sought for the statement in Senate, said the county government should provide minutes of the tender committee and the report of the County Technical Tender Evaluation Committee.He also wants the county to explain if the procurement procedure was followed in awarding the tender.
