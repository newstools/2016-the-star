The US Justice Department is investigating whether recent reports of alleged intimidation and harassment, including in schools and at churches, violate federal hate crime and other civil rights laws, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday. "Many Americans are concerned by a spate of recent news reports about alleged hate crimes and harassment... The FBI is assessing, in conjunction with federal prosecutors, whether particular incidents constitute violations of federal law," Lynch said in a statement. "We need you to continue to report these incidents to local law enforcement, as well as the Justice Department, so that our career investigators and prosecutors can take action to defend your rights," she added.
