The Jubilee Party yesterday selected five Members of the County Assembly to represent them in the Nairobi campaign team that was named by President Uhuru Kenyatta.The five were chosen in a meeting at the party&rsquo;s Nairobi headquarters and will be chaired by Nairobi assembly minority leader Abdi Guyo.The others are minority chief whip Hashim Kamau, Zulfa Hakim, Irungu Kenneth and Rachael Kamwero.Speaking at the meeting, Nairobi governor aspirant Johnson Sakaja said, &ldquo;This team will mobilise voters in the city to ensure Jubilee has the majority of the seats in the general election.&rdquo;The team is also expected to deliver the Nairobi governor and constituency seats to the Jubilee Party.&ldquo;We are all fighting against one [Governor] Evans Kidero, whom we intend to send home on August 8,&rdquo; Sakaja said.He said Jubilee was targeting two main constituencies, Westlands and Kibra that have previously been opposition strongholds.Four of the governor aspirants who want to run on the JP ticket attended the meeting and said they will work together to ensure the seat is won by the Jubilee Party.Former Starehe legislator Margret Wanjiru said JP will be &ldquo;fair to all&rdquo; in the nomination process to be overseen by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.JP wants to unite Kenyans and the party will start with Nairobi, as it is a multi-ethnic city, she said.&ldquo;Nairobi is greater than us all, thus we won&rsquo;t be led by selfishness. All we want is to deliver the governor seat to the Jubilee Party regardless of the candidate,&rdquo; she said.Meanwhile, members have resolved to take disciplinary action on aspirants who carry out &lsquo;rowdy and inciting&rsquo; campaigns.The legislators said they will not allow a few individuals to taint the party&rsquo;s image.This comes days after the President and Deputy President William Ruto named former Tourism minister Raphael Tuju to head the Party Secretariat. The announcement was made after a National Governing Council meeting held at the Bomas of Kenya.Among the key responsibilities of the secretariat is to maintain membership discipline.
