An NGO is using primary school pupils to promote the coffee industry. Rodi-Kenya has partnered with the Coffee Research Foundation in the already existing School Based Crime Prevention and Life Skills Programme.Executive director Eliud Ngunjiri said his organisation has clubs in more than 70 primary schools. He said the project will be extended to all coffee-growing zones to start nurseries. Ngunjiri said children will be given coffee seedlings to plant in their homes.The CEO was speaking at Rodi&rsquo;s resource centre in Ruiru on Saturday.Ngunjiri said the pupils will be trained in organic coffee growing best practices, processing and value addition.&ldquo;Marketing has remained a challenge because Kenyans do not consume their own coffee. They rely on outside markets, leaving them at the mercies of external buyers and consumers,&rdquo; he said.
