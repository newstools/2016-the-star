Tullow Oil will restart exploration and appraisal drilling at Kenya's prolific South Lokichar field next month, where it saw an upside potential of more than one billion barrels of recoverable oil, a senior official said yesterday."A recent 3-D survey shows additional upside potential," Tullow Oil Africa business vice president Tim O'Hanlon told an oil and gas conference in Cape Town.The multinational company, which has its main production assets in Ghana, has exploration acreage in Mauritania, Namibia and Zambia.O'Hanlon said in Uganda, where it had 1.7 billion barrels of oil to develop, Tullow Oil was targeting an export pipeline capable of taking 200-230,000bpd to Tanga port in Tanzania.He said front-end engineering and design of the pipeline will start next year and a final investment decision was expected in 2018.
