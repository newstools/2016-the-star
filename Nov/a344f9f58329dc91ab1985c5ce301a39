No Cord MP visited Musalia Mudavadi for a discussion on dropping his 2017 presidential bid, the Amani leader's spokesman said on Tuesday.Kibisu Kabatesi dismissed the claims by Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali as "hogwash" and part of Jubilee propaganda to scuttle the National Super Alliance (NASA).The super alliance aims to unite key opposition parties to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta from power come the August 8, 2017 general election.Washiali told a meeting in Matungu on Saturday that Cord leader Raila Odinga sent MPs to Mudavadi to urge him to vie for Nairobi governor.The MP said this would deny the Luhya community a chance to form or be part of the government that will be formed after the next election.Lugari MP Ayub Savula also made similar claims on Friday saying the MPs were from Nyanza and included one who was elected in Nairobi. The Star could not independently verify whether such a meeting took place.But Kabatesi said in a statement: "There has never been such a visit and claims by Washiali are part of Jubilee propaganda to confuse Luhya support for Mudavadi."Read: Don't undermine Mudavadi's 2017 bid for President, Cord toldThe spokesman further said Mudavadi and Raila do not need emissaries to talk to each other as "they do one-on-one talks quite often".He said Jubilee has engaged in cheap propaganda because it fears facing a united opposition with the Amani National Congress leader as the flag bearer.Kabatesi said Washiali and his group were ruining MUdavadi's plans for "handsome handouts" from Jubilee."It is a well -known fact that the likes of Washiali are better off campaigning for Uhuru than offering themselves for re-election," he said.He added that Washiali and other Jubilee sympathisers were dismissively appointed as Uhuru's campaigners because none of them will go to the ballot."Unfortunately for Uhuru, the likes of Washiali profess support for Jubilee during the day but swear allegiance to handsome hand-outs at night while begging for accommodation in the opposition," he said.Mudavadi ealier termed Washiali's claims that he led Western MPs to Jubilee in 2013 as "regrettable lies".He said the cooperation between his former outfit, UDF, and Jubilee was signed by the party's chairman , not him.Read: You're in Jubilee to mint money, Mudavadi tells Washiali
