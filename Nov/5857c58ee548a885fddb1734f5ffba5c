The CJ said some cases have been running for more than five years.The CJ was on a tour of courts in Western. He also visited Butere and Bungoma.In Mumias, Maraga was shown around the court compound before he visited the juvenile and adult cells.He greeted suspects who were waiting for court proceedings of their cases.On court space, Maraga said most rooms are too small to accommodate residents who wish to follow proceedings concerning relatives or themselves. &ldquo;The judiciary will be working towards expanding the size of courtrooms, not only in Mumias, but across the country,&rdquo; Maraga said.He said Mumias is a big town with a large population and requires a minimum of three courts and four magistrates.The Supreme Court president asked Mumias senior principal magistrate Teresa Odera to ensure separation of adults and children in the cells.
