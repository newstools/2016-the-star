A dispute pending in court over the Mwea Settlement Scheme will not deter the issuance of title deeds, National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri has said.During his visit to Embu on Tuesday, Swazuri said the title deeds of over 7,232 beneficiaries of the more than 55,000 acres will be issued, despite the case filed by the Kirinyaga county government. The land is in Mbeere South subcounty.He said the court order t has not been served on the commission nor the ministry of Lands to stop the process.He said there was no reason why they should delay the issuance of the title deeds.He revealed that some leaders from Embu were behind the delay in settling the residents on the settlement scheme where the dispute has lasted 40 years.Swazuri accused the leaders of frustrating the exercise for their selfish gain instead of putting the interests of the residents first.He lamented that despite the commission having found an amicable solution to the land dispute and started the process of issuing title deeds to the beneficiaries, some local leaders had opted to delay the process further by going to court.Swazuri said the land in Mwea was among the places in which historical injustices were meted out on the residents of Embu and the commission wanted to solve the dispute once and for all.The Kirinyaga county claims it has obtained an order restraining the government from issuing title deeds to 7,232 landless people who have already been allocated the Mwea land.It claims the land belongs to the county and thus wants the issuance of the documents stopped until the case is heard and determined. Embu community leaders sought the nullification of the adjudication process.
