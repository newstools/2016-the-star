The National Cereals and Produce Board is preparing a national farmers register so that only genuine ones benefit from fertiliser and price subsidy programmes.Middlemen have been exploiting the producers.Corporate affairs manager Rose Andanje said the board is ensuring that only genuine farmers are allowed to sell maize at its depots. The farmers must be registered by the Ministry of Agriculture, she said.Farmers will be verified and the quantity of maize they offer for sale to the board must be commensurate to the acreage they planted, Andanje said.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said the register should have both cereals and livestock farmers.Middlemen have been buying maize from farmers at throwaway prices or importing and selling it to the NCPB, thus benefiting from state support, to disadvantage of farmers.
