President Barack Obama has urged Democrats of all ethnic backgrounds to get out and vote for Hillary Clinton, warning that the fate of the US republic - and the world - is at stake.He said her Republican opponent Donald Trump was a threat to hard-earned civil rights, the country and the world.President Obama was speaking at a rally in North Carolina.Mr Trump said Mr Obama should stop campaigning for Mrs Clinton and focus on running the country."The bottom line is, no-one wants four more years of Obama," he told supporters in Pensacola, Florida.He said Mrs Clinton had become "unhinged" in recent days."The fate of the republic rests on your shoulders," President Obama told supporters in the key battleground state of North Carolina."The fate of the world is teetering and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction."I am not on the ballot, but I tell you what - fairness is on the ballot; decency is on the ballot; justice is on the ballot; progress is on the ballot; our democracy is on the ballot."The FBI is now investigating new emails that may be linked to its probe into Mrs Clinton's private email server.The agency's director, James Comey, has faced a fierce backlash for announcing the move just 11 days before the presidential election.Earlier, Mr Obama implicitly criticised him over the new inquiry into Mrs Clinton's email use.In an interview with website NowThisNew, published on Wednesday, Mr Obama said US investigations should not operate on the basis of "innuendo" or "incomplete information".Mr Obama's remarks were his first public comments since Mr Comey's announcement on Friday that the FBI had discovered a new batch of emails that might or might not be relevant to an earlier, closed investigation into Mrs Clinton's handling of classified information."I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don't operate on innuendo, we don't operate on incomplete information, we don't operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made," said Mr Obama."When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the justice department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable."
