Kenya might not take part in future peacekeeping missions after the UN humiliated its good intention in South Sudan, Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed has said.Early this month, Kenya ordered an immediate withdrawal of Kenyan troops from South Sudan following the sacking of Ondieki.Speaking to the Star on Sunday, she termed the dismissal of Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki as a humiliation of Kenya's willingness to advocate for peace in the continent. We are a sovereign state and we cannot be ridiculed by an organisation. The country is really contemplating on its involvement in future peacekeeping missions, Amina said.She said a series of faults occurred during the dismissal Ondieki.Amina said the state did not get any official communication explaining Ondieki's dismissal as the Commander of the UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan.Despite Kenya seeking to resolve the matter in a peaceful way, its efforts were futile as the UN failed to respond. The Kenyan government tried to reach the offices of UN and they failed to respond, Amina said.Amina faulted the decision to dismiss the general, yet there was no full report. The UN acted on an executive report, we expected as an international organisation it would wait for the full report before giving a verdict, she said.She also said Ondieki had only served as head of the mission for 21 days before the violence erupted. Ondieki started working on June 17, while violence erupted on July 8. He had barely taken charge of the mission and I don't see why he is carrying the whole blame over the issue, the CS said.The country has dispatched more than 30,000 troops in more than 40 peace-keeping missions in the continent since 1974.In South Sudan, Kenya had deployed 1,000 troops making it one of the mission s biggest supporters, according to AFP.Kenya's involvement in the programme came under IGAD and was aimed at helping South Sudan get on its feet after a civil war.Peace-keeping mission process.The decision to deploy peace support personnel for international and regional missions is solely made by the National Security Council.The NSC, then advises the President. After the President's approval, then the National Assembly's approval is required.The request for parliamentary approval will ordinarily be done through motions moved by the majority leaders or their designates in Parliament.The deployment of the officers to the missions is then done after fulfillment of rigorous peace operations training consisting of three months pre-deployment training of the personnel.
