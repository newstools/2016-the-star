MPs will next week fly to Mombasa to inspect the portable clinics that were procured by the Ministry of Health.The 80 containers are stored at the National Youth Service camp in Miritini and will be distributed to various slums across the country beginning with Nairobi this month.Parliamentary Committee on Health chair Rachel Nyamai said on Wednesday they will inspect one fully fitted demonstration container in Nairobi and fly to Mombasa the next day to see the rest. It s important to ascertain that taxpayers money was used well, she said yesterday when the committee questioned top ministry officials on alleged misuse of funds.The probe stems from a leaked draft audit report that raised flags on how Sh3.2 billion was spent in the 2015/2016 financial year.Health Principal Secretary Dr Nicholas Muraguri, director of Medical Services Dr Jackson Kioko and three other senior officials represented the ministry during the hearing.Health Cabinet Secretary Dr Cleopa Mailu, who had also been summoned, did not attend the meeting because he was being grilled by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission officials at the same time.MPs said they had not fully studied the interim audit report and the ministry's responses but mostly relied on media reports to question the PS and the other ministry officials.Dr Muraguri said all expenditure mentioned in the report have been accounted for.He said the ministry was appalled that a draft audit report was leaked to the media before officials responsible could respond to the issues it raised. An internal audit identifies areas of strength and weakness and my staff had not answered the queries it raised. The proper process of an internal audit was never followed, he said.
