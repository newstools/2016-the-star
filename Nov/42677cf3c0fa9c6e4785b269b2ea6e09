Seven unions yesterday called for a genuine and all-inclusive social dialogue with the SRC to end the stalemate on job evaluation. They said they support calls for a national strike over job evaluation by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. The unions under the umbrella of Association of Public Sector Union of Kenya spokesman Ernest Nadome said the SRC has worsened the welfare of civil servants. Nadome, who is also the secretary general of the Kenya Electrical Trade and Allied Workers Union, said they support demands of workers in the health sector at national and county government level. &ldquo;We demand that both levels of government enter into negotiations with workers unions to resolve the looming industrial crisis,&rdquo; he said. Nadome said since 2013, the SRC has continued to sidestep its mandate of setting and reviewing remuneration for state officers.
