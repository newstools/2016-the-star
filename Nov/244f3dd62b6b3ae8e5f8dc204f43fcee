The 2016 Rio Olympic Games Probe Committee has recommended that four individuals refund monies they utilised despite not playing a part in the XXXI Olympiad.The committee wants sprinter Boniface Mweresa, hurdler Kiprono Koskei, 5000m runner Thomas Longosiwa to refund the overseas allowances paid to them despite not traveling to Brazil.The trio were paid the allowances alongside Maurine Mutuku, who never traveled to Rio due to an illness but was quite exemplary to return all the allowances.Mweresa, Koskei and Longosiwa received Sh761, 833.50 despite not traveling to Rio where they were named as reserves.In addition, the committee, formed to investigate the shambolic management of Team Kenya before, during and after the games, has recommended that Vincent Kinyili Paul, son of National Olympic Committee secretary general Francis Kinyili to refund the ticket money granted to him by the ministry of sports, culture and the arts. It is worth pointing out that Vincent Kinyili Paul was neither a team Kenya official nor an athlete. They need to refund the ticket money, said the report.The report also recommended that government allowance rates by the salaries and remunerations committee be used at all times to avoid excess payments. Athletes were supposed to be paid USD200 per day for allowances, but they were paid at USD250 per day, said the report, adding: Athletes and officials should be paid for the number of days they are out of the country as opposed to a paying for the whole duration of the games yet it was envisioned that once a team has completed its competitions they should return back. In addition, the report also claims expelled team manager Michael Rotich and coach John Anzara received full amounts of their overseas allowances despite returning home before the completion of the days they were meant to be in Rio.Anzrah was sent home by the chef de mission for using Ferguson Rotich s accreditation card to access the athletes dining area while Rotich was kicked out after German television channel ARD and The Times of London alleged that he had solicited payment to alert athletes on upcoming random out of competition tests.
