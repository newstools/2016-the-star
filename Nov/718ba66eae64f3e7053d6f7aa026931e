Ford Kenya has hit back at Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka, accusing him of displaying ignorance in public, following his recent attacks on Moses Wetang ula s presidential bid.During a rally attended by Deputy President William Ruto in Mayuba Stadium, Sirisia constituency, on Saturday, Lusaka said Wetang ula s quest for the presidency is far-fetched, out of reach and can only happen in a dreamland .He told the Bungoma senator to stop confusing Western residents. Lusaka urged Wetang ula to stop building castles in the air and, instead, wake up to the reality that he will never be Cord s flagbearer at the 2017 election.But Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu yesterday dismissed Lusaka s comments, describing him as the worst tragedy to befall Bungoma.He said Lusaka lacks the moral authority or political legitimacy to talk about Wetang ula s presidential ambition. Bungoma has had many tragedies, but the election of Lusaka as governor stands out as the worst. He has no leg to stand on to criticise Wetang ula s presidential ambition, Simiyu said.The Tongaren MP said Lusaka s term as governor has been characterised by squandering of county resources. Lusaka has no idea what he is talking about because he lives in his own perverted world, the world of corruption, he said.Simiyu said the county chief has been a disgrace to residents, as he presides over corruption and mismanagement of resources in a way that has made Bungoma ugly to Kenyans.
