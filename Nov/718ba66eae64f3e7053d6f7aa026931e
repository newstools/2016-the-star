Ford Kenya has hit back at Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka, accusing him of displaying ignorance in public, following his recent attacks on Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s presidential bid.During a rally attended by Deputy President William Ruto in Mayuba Stadium, Sirisia constituency, on Saturday, Lusaka said Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s quest for the presidency &ldquo;is far-fetched, out of reach and can only happen in a dreamland&rdquo;.He told the Bungoma senator to stop confusing Western residents. Lusaka urged Wetang&rsquo;ula to stop building castles in the air and, instead, wake up to the reality that he will never be Cord&rsquo;s flagbearer at the 2017 election.But Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu yesterday dismissed Lusaka&rsquo;s comments, describing him as the worst tragedy to befall Bungoma.He said Lusaka lacks the moral authority or political legitimacy to talk about Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s presidential ambition.&ldquo;Bungoma has had many tragedies, but the election of Lusaka as governor stands out as the worst. He has no leg to stand on to criticise Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s presidential ambition,&rdquo; Simiyu said.The Tongaren MP said Lusaka&rsquo;s term as governor has been characterised by squandering of county resources.&ldquo;Lusaka has no idea what he is talking about because he lives in his own perverted world, the world of corruption,&rdquo; he said.Simiyu said the county chief has been a disgrace to residents, as he presides over corruption and mismanagement of resources in a way that has made Bungoma ugly to Kenyans.
