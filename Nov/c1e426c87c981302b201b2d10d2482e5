Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga has dismissed the recent installation of ODM leader Raila Odinga as Kalenjin elder saying it had no political significance.Chepkonga said the installation done on Tuesday last week at Moiben - the backyard of Deputy President William Ruto - was not the community s endorsement of Raila s 2017 presidential bid.Read: Raila crowned Kalenjin elder in Ruto's backyard Chepkonga said Raila s installation was not done according to the Kalenjin culture."Installation of any leader as Kalenjin elder is a sacred affair. It is done after meticulous preparations by selected elders. We were surprised to watch Raila being dressed with a baboon skin instead of the tradition colobus monkey skin. It was derogatory," he said. He said during a fundraiser in Keiyo South at the weekend that Kalenjin council of elders popularly known as kootab myoot were not involved in the exercise."When I heard the former PM was being installed as an elder, I called Kalenjin council of elders official John Seii who told me he was not aware of such a ceremony," the national assembly legal affairs committee chairman said.Seii, who was at the fundraiser steered clear of the issue, only urging professionals holding high profile jobs not to resign to join to politics.The installation sparked a debate in the North Rift following reports that elders who crowned Raila had no cultural authority to carry out the exercise.It also emerged that in Chesongoch, Marakwet East, the opposition chief was dressed in a belt that is usually won by women after birth.This raised questions of whether the traditional regalia were used to demean Raila, or it was just ignorance by those who installed him.Further to this, other quarters argued that it is not allowed for someone to be installed as an elder twice. The Cord leader had already been installed as a Kalenjin elder some years back where he was named Arap Mibei - the man from the water.Raila is set to hold a series of political rallies in the North Rift as battle for the vote-rich region begins.Read: Raila s one-on-one strategy to woo RiftODM Marakwet chairman Samuel Chemweno said on Monday that the former PM will tour the area at a date that will be confirmed.
