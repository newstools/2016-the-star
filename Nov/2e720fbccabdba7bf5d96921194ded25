I cannot discuss any matter with the likes of Kuria," Mwangi said.But Kuria accused Mwangi of being morally corrupt describing him as a coward."Before he points fingers at others, let him cleanse his moral corruption. He is just a small boy who was saved the other day from the streets," Kuria said.Kuria further said Mwangi was the kind of a person comparable to the prerogative of the harlots."Let him be told that you cannot say about me when am not there but cannot say about me when am there, that is cowardice," he said.Kuria further defended the government over the recent Sh5.3 billion scandal at the Afya House.He accused the Nation Media Group of misleading the public.More on this: Nation Media company received Mafia House cash, CS Mucheru says in letter to Media CouncilHe said the Health PS Nicholas Muraguri was right in the way he reacted towards the Business Daily reporter"Being arrogant is not a criminal offense to take you to jail, it can only take you to hell," he said.Read: Muraguri apologises for threatening journalist after Sh5bn exposeKuria said he would resign as an MP if it is truly established that money had misappropriated at the Ministry of Health.Also read: Raila rubbishes probe on Sh5 billion health funds loss, says it is cover-up
