The 46-year-old began her modeling career when she was 16, and at the age of 18 signed with a modeling agency in Milan, Italy.She has appeared on numerous magazine covers including Harper s Bazaar and Vanity Fair, and once posed naked on a white rug for British magazine GQ.The Clintons Went To Her WeddingBill and Hillary Clinton were among the 350 guests when Melania and Donald tied the knot at the groom s landmark in Palm Beach, Florida.According to GQ, the bride wore a $100,000 (Sh1.2m) Dior dress with 1,500 crystals, which took a legendary 550 hours to make. It had a 13ft train and the bride wore a 16ft veil.However, the gown was so difficult to walk in that Melania changed into a Vera Wang hand-ruched silk tulle Grecian dress for the poolside after-party. Her 12-carat, emerald-cut Graff wedding ring is said to be worth 1.5m (Sh189m).Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump vote at PS 59 in New York, New York, U.S. November 8, 2016.Photo ReutersShe Speaks Five LanguagesSlovenian, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguistic prowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggested her thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside her immigrant-bashing husband.Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concrete tower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito.She Is The Least Popular Presidential Spouse Since HillaryAccording to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, Melania is the least popular presidential candidate spouse since Hillary Clinton.A survey on the spouses and running mates of both presidential candidates saw Clinton s husband, former president Bill, named most popular, with more than half of respondents having a positive opinion of him.
