I wish all such individuals the best in their endeavours, reads a letter from Governor John Mruttu. I need, however, to emphasise that we are in government to serve the public and such ambitions should not conflict with the duty to serve. Mruttu said the staff should make formal declarations to his office not later than November 11.
