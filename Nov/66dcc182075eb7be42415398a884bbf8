We trust you will take the necessary remedial action."The clause, in the Code of Conduct for the Practice of Journalism, prohibits the publication of obscene or vulgar material unless it is newsworthyMiguna dismissed the video clip saying it had been edited. But the council noted he and Passaris issued "disparaging" remarks against each other, and used "abusive and demeaning language".Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and women activists asked the Media council of Kenya to take action against the television station.Kidero filed a complaint with MCK against Standard Group and Koinange in particular, saying Miguna referred to him as a "thief" during the show.The Governor wrote a letter to council chairman Charles Kerich and copied it to the media group's chief executive Sam Shollei.Kidero said the host has allowed Miguna, on several occasions, to malign and libel him as a thief", and that he has failed to adhere to the requirements of the journalism profession. He said this was the fourth time the lawyer was maligning him with the "encouragement" of the host. I am writing to you, as a custodian of journalist ethics and standards, to look into the issues and take necessary quality assurance, he said.Also read: Miguna Miguna hints at vying for Nairobi Governor in 2017
