ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire has asked Deputy President William Ruto to stop dramatising the war against corruption in the country.He said it was unfortunate that the DP is keen on diverting the debate by launching a vigorous campaign to discredit Cord leader Raila Odinga' anti-graft credentials.The Kitutu Masaba MP said the DP's statement to the effect that Raila is an economic saboteur were "mischievous, irresponsible and dis-respective".He said the last week's sentiments were aimed at demeaning Raila's anti-corruption track record and also an aversion of the responsibility expected of the Jubilee chiefs."Ruto should take the path of responsibility and respect the Cord leader for doing his work as a political wizard," Bosire told the Star on phone Sunday.While campaigning at the Coast last week, Ruto asked the ODM to stop opposing development projects that improve lives of people."Raila and his family are using tap water, yet he is opposing projects meant to quench the thirst of Kenyans," Ruto said during the tour."You tell us you are seeking leadership, yet you oppose development projects that are set to benefit poor Kenyans. Don&rsquo;t be cheated by this man," the DP said at Werugha on Friday.Read: Don&rsquo;t fight projects that help citizens, DP Ruto urges Raila But Bosire said Ruto had launched an onslaught to discredit Raila without appreciating that the Cord leader has never been disapproved in his graft claims.He cited the confirmation of the loss of funds following NYS multi-billion scandal as some of the issues that Jubilee has turned away its eyes from."Calling Raila an economic saboteur is failing to accept the gravity of corruption. It is also arrogant and disrespectful of a man whose references are based on facts," Bosire said.Bosire said Ruto had become fond of arrogating himself powers which he does not have without portraying the larger picture of Kenyans."Raila is out to see things done correctly, appropriately and timely. His aim is to ensure proper utilisation of public resources," the MP said. Bosire said the opposition will continue performing its mandate of pointing out where public resources have not been spent well."Instead of Ruto apologising to Kenyans for the massive corruption, he has decided to engage in propaganda and sensationalisation of issues," he said.Raila has opposed the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang&rsquo;a and Itare Dam projects saying they are being hastily implemented without public participation.Read: Jubilee's Sh6.8bn secret water project will turn counties to deserts - Raila The Cord leader wants the projects stopped citing "catastrophic environmental damages they pose".
