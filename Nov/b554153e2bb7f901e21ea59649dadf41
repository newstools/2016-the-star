The IEBC Selection Committee will next Wednesday publish the names of the more than applicants who sent in their applications by Tuesday's deadline.The committee said it had received 13 applications for the position of chairperson and more than 800 for the six available slots for members."The precise number will crystallise when the applications of applicants, who put in multiple applications through the various media, have been harmonised," Selection Committee chairperson Bernadette Musundi said. "As a result of the unprecedented numbers of applications received, the consolidation of all applications has taken a considerably longer time than anticipated."She said once this is done, the Selection Panel will publish the names in the Kenya Gazette, two newspapers of national circulation and the Parliamentary Service Commission website.This will include the names of the applicants and their qualifications as stipulated in their applications."The Selection Panel will thereafter begin the shortlisting exercise and publish the shortlist. This advertisement will also invite the views of the public on the suitability of shortlisted candidates for a period of seven days," Musundi said.This will be followed by the public interviewing of the candidates, which will be broadcast on live TV. After conducting interviews, the selection panel shall select two persons qualified to be appointed as chairperson and nine persons qualified to be appointed as members of the commission and shall forward the names to the President for nomination of one person for appointment as the chairperson and six persons for appointment as members, the law says.Within seven days, the President will forward the list of nominees to the National Assembly for approval in accordance with the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Act. The President shall, within seven days of receipt of the names approved by the National Assembly, by notice in the Gazette, appoint the chairperson and the members, the law states.The recruitment of the new commissioners arose from the enactment of amendments to the IEBC Act, which led to the resignation of the current ones.This followed a negotiated process between Jubilee and Cord after the opposition held protests to demand the removal of the commissioners.
