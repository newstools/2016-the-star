Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed claims Jubilee is biased in resource distribution. He said the national government is committed to serving all Kenyans. “We have not isolated regions that did not vote for Jubilee. That is why we are setting up projects in all the counties, irrespective of their vote pattern,” Ruto said. He said the days when development was based on who voted for who or tribal affiliations were long gone and he and President Uhuru Kenyatta are committed to bringing all Kenyans together. Ruto spoke in Lung’anyiro, Matungu constituency, Kakamega, on Saturday. He presided over a funds drive for women’s groups from the constituency. The DP said the national government is committed to unifying all Kenyans. Ruto said the government is improving roads in Kakamega to enable farmers to take their farm produce to the market with ease. “We have renovated the Kisumu–Kakamega road, only the flyover to Kakamega town remains. We are also repairing the Kakamega–Webuye road,” he said. The DP said the Butere–Sigalagala road will be complete in three to four months. Ruto said the government had set aside  Sh720 million for the Kakamega County Referral Hospital. “Our intention is to ensure the people of Kakamega don’t have to travel to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital or KNH seeking specialised treatment,” he said.
