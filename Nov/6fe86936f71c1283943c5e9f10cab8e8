Visiting Kampala boxing Club defeated Nairobi 6-2 over the weekend to lift the 2016 Harold Obunga Memorial Trophy at Kaloleni handball court.Kampala, coached by former Kenya Breweries boxer Hubs Khalili, won six bouts against Nairobi s two.Nairobi coach Kenneth Valdez Ochieng and his assistant Maurice Kawata Maina watched helplessly as their boxers received a real bashing from the Ugandans.Valdez attributed the humiliating 6-2 bouts defeat to inadequate preparations and inexperience. We groom boxers but they re grabbed by KDF and other clubs taking part in the league. Like today, our team was made up of boxers without experience but if we had our regulars we would have won easily, said Valdez.The event held in honour of former Kenya international Harold Obunga, brought together several boxing legends including former world champion Steve Muchoki, Aloice Les Les Muiruri, Olympian Steve Vedo Okumu and Athanus Nzau, a celebrity in his own right during his professional boxing days.Obunga died in a road accident in 1994 along Mombasa Road. He was also part of the 1988 Seoul Olympics Games.
