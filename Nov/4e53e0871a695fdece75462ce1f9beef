The fight for deceased Coast tycoon Swaleh Nguru's assets may end after the executor of the estate agreed to distribute the property among family members.Family patriarch Awadh Said, Nguru's eldest son and who was left in charge of the estate, told a court he is ready to divide the wealth between his siblings and other heirs, 44 years after the death of his father.Said was sued by his younger brother Omar Saleh, who claimed he held on to their late father&rsquo;s will against the wishes of other family members.The petitioner also claimed his brother was allegedly interfering with the assets, despite a court order restraining any interference.He said he was employing trickery to continue enjoying the property at the expense of other beneficiaries.Other parties in the suit include Bark Sherman, widow of Nguru's son Mohammed Sherman. Sherman accused Said of being the biggest impediment by failing to administer the will four decades 40 after the death of the family patriarch.She said her husband died 16 years ago without inheriting his share because Said declined to execute it.
