Confusion clouds plans to move the Kenya Technical Trainers College to Kenya Science Campus as the deadline fast-approaches.The Star has established that despite Education CS Fred Matiang i s directive that KTTC moves by December 1, activities are still in progress, with a teacher-based training in session. Sessions take place during holidays.A source at the college said, They have never received a letter telling them to move. Recommendations by the Ombudsman propose that the plan be suspended until a task force looks into the hurried decision to move the college.Ombusdman Otiende Amollo said the fate of 2,400 KTTC students has not been addressed, at a time when the college is in the middle of a Sh5 billion public-private partnership project to build hostels for 4,500 students.The University of Nairobi s management board says the 938 KSC students would not get adequate accommodation in either Kikuyu campus or the college of biological and physical sciences.
