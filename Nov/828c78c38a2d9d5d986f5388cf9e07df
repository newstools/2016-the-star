Kenyan Victor Kipchirchir and Valary Jemeli won the 36th edition of the Valencia Marathon yesterday.Kipchirchir won in a time of 2:07.38 leading Gilbert Yegon and Abel Kirui to second and third respectively. However, Kipchirchir could not break John Mwangangi s course record of 2.06.13 he set while winning the event last year.It all seemed to be a new mark in the men s category, as the difference was 48 seconds from the record at 30km (1:29:13). In fact, at this point, the duel was between Yegon and Kirui, names that were not considered favourite but managed to whip all the other top runners, who had entered the race with excessively fast pace.However, Kipchirchir managed to recover from 40km but the pace had worsened to 51 seconds above the best record mainly due to the wind, which played a key role in the second part of the race. However, Jemeli managed to succeed where Kipchirchir failed, clocking 2:24:48 to slice almost two minutes off the previous best mark. Jemeli had skipped her title defence at yesterday s Kass marathon to make time for the Spanish race.The best mark of the Valencia race was previously held by Namibian Beata Naigambo Nandjala at 2.26:57, clocked during last year s edition. In addition, the mark achieved by Jemeli is the best time achieved on Spanish soil in the distance, which was also in his possession with 2.25:26 achieved this same year in the Barcelona Marathon. This year Valencia Marathon attracted a record participation of 19,000 runners, 16 of them with a personal mark below 2:10.
