ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru has dismissed claims by Cord leaders that he and DP William Ruto are influencing the electoral process ahead of next year's general election.The opposition claimed Mucheru and Ruto were holding informal meetings with IEBC to sway the ongoing recruitment of seven new electoral chiefs.More on this: Cord claims IEBC, Ruto, Mucheru in secret talksBut the CS said: "The allegations by Senators James Orengo and Johnstone Muthama and their colleagues are malicious, false and baseless and should be treated with the contempt they deserve.He added: "They have no evidence to prove what they are saying because what they are accusing us of is not true and they know it."Mucheru said he wishes to assure all Kenyans that the government is committed to and focused on its people-centred development agenda as well as a free and fair electoral process."And (it) will not be dissuaded by sideshows designed to whip up public emotions and sympathy," he added.Cord launched a new broadside against the IEBC on Tuesday saying top Jubilee leaders were secretly meeting electoral agency bosses to influence the 2017 poll.Orengo, Muthama and MP Eseli Simiyu also alleged the pro-Jubilee meetings aim to block the full and comprehensive implementation of new electoral laws that make rigging more difficult. We are informed Jubilee is opposed to the appointment to the commission of Kenyans who are patriotic and progressive and have a background and history of fighting for reform and change in Kenya, the three said in a joint statementRuto rubbished the allegations on Tuesday, as more empty and destructive opposition propaganda.He denounced the statement, citing Cord s destructive tendency of casting aspersions on anyone, everyone and anything . Cord has made it loud and clear it will not accept next year s general election if their candidate does not win, the DP's press secretary, David Mugonyi, told the Star. Not once, not twice, they have told Kenyans in their endless press conferences, which lack any agenda, and weekend funeral circuits, that they will cause violence if they do not win. The electoral commission also denied any improper contact but did not deny a meeting between Ruto, Mucheru and top IEBC bosses.Communications manager Andrew Limo told the Star the commission was not aware of improper engagements with any political party as alleged. Our engagements are formal and above board, Limo said in a brief text.Read: Jubilee plans to rig 2017 polls - RailaAlso read: IEBC denies working with Jubilee to sabotage 2017 elections
