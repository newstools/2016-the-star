Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i yesterday criticised politicians who wanted to provide food &mdash; bearing their photos and slogans &mdash; to KPCE exam candidates in Mombasa. He said the government will not allow petty politics in schools.Matiang&rsquo;i supported Coast Regional coordinator Nelson Marwa&rsquo;s directive to bar politicians from providing food to KCPE exam candidates. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho wanted to distribute food in packages bearing his portrait and a picture of cheering children.The containers bore the words &lsquo;Hassan Joho wishes you the best in your annual exams, baba ni kulea &hellip; 001&rsquo;.Matiang&rsquo;i said it is unfortunate leaders are taking politics to schoolchildren for selfish interests. He spoke in Kwale as he toured schools.He said primary and secondary school education is a national and not a county function. &ldquo;If everyone goes to our schools and prints T-shirts and portraits, how would the schools look?&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i asked.He said the government is not banning politicians from feeding children, but they are asking &ldquo;simple common sense questions&rdquo;. &ldquo;You take bread and put your portrait on it and bring it to the children, can&rsquo;t we be satisfied if your portrait is not there? We will not allow it to happen now or in the future,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.The CS said the government will not allow anarchy in such issues. &ldquo;You saw what they did during the mock exams. Governors put their portraits on exam papers. I have never seen such madness in my life. Others bought school buses and put pictures of themselves on them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Imagine walking into a school and you find a face of governor in one wall and a face of another pretender in a second wall.&rdquo;Matiang&rsquo;i said those who want to provide food for schools must consult the deputy county education directors and government officials. &ldquo;What I expect to see in a school is a President&rsquo;s portrait, period,&rdquo; he said.He said Muslim and Christian organisations support schools, but they never blow their own trumpets. &ldquo;The Catholic Church supports children in many ways and they don&rsquo;t go around arguing with the county, regional commissioners, the Education CS and telling everyone off,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.On Monday, Marwa barred politicians from providing food to KCPE candidates. Schools in Mombasa obeyed the directive and turned down the food.
