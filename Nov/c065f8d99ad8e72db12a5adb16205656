Isiolo County government has initiated concerted efforts to ensure that the County becomes open defecation free by February next year.The county revealed this during celebrations to mark the World Toilets day, saying it is in an effort to cushion residents from diseases caused by poor hygiene.UNICEF country director Andrew Trorett said that it was very unfortunate that over 9,000 children under 5 years die from diarrhea in Kenya every year. He said that this was a high number, adding that in the year 2009-2010, at least 18 children died in Isiolo due to the same reason. Trorett said that the issue of open defecation was of great importance to the organisation as it greatly impacts on the well being of children. He held that it was unacceptable to lose such a high number of lives to diarrhea and other related causes even after 160 years of knowledge of the adverse effects of poor sanitation.Read: Poor sanitation costing the country Sh27 billion annually - Amref The official lauded the Isiolo county government for launching the 100-day rapid result initiative to ensure that the county is declared open defecation free. Isiolo governor Godana Doyo said that poor sanitation greatly contributes to the overall health situation in the county adding that it was important to work with the communities to ensure that they are protected from preventable diseases. He said that his government had placed sanitation on top of its development agenda, adding that only 1% of the population in Isiolo town were connected to the sewerage system. Doyo said that the county government had made deliberate efforts to reverse the trend of open defecation by engaging the local communities through community health volunteers."Chiefs and religious leaders have also been roped in to ensure that all households dig pit latrines and use them," the governor said. He said that the results of this sensitisation programme were already evident and expressed optimism of meeting the February deadline.
