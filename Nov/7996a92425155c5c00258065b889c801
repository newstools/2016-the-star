Retired President Daniel Moi authorised allocation of land that is at the centre of a legal battle between the Anglican Church of Kenya and the Kabete Technical Training Institute.Documents from the National Land Commission indicate that five acres in Kabete were allocated to ACK St Joseph on instructions of the President. There are three cases in court over ownership of the five acres. They are part of 52 acres KTTI is claiming ownership.In 1996, ACK went to court seeking orders to have the institute kicked out of the land. In 2000, students from the institute rioted and took control of the five acres. The land is now under the control of the church.It has emerged, however, the initial title deed for the institute was not altered and the 52 acres are still intact. The details are contained in a memo by then ACK Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi to then Lands minister Amos Kimunya. In a letter dated June 3, 1987, the Most Rev Manasses Kuria, the then Archbishop of Kenya and Bishop of Nairobi, requested for formalisation of ownership of the plot from former President Daniel Moi, for a free hold title to be given to the church for the potion of land, the memo dated May 2003 reads.It says the church was given an allotment letter for five acres on June 12, 1987, and it informed the institute on September 4, 1989. The Commissioner of Lands also wrote to the institute on July 5, 1990, confirming the allotment was valid.NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri visited the institution to unravel the mystery surrounding the dispute. He asked why the Lands and the Education ministries were not involved in the excision of the land. Swazuri also wanted to know why the original title deed for 52 acres is still intact. Swazuri gave the church two weeks to avail ownership documents, failing which the land will be given back to KTTI.
