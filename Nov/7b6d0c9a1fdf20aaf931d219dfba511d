Health CS Cleopa Mailu will be forced to pay from his pocket if he hires external auditors to go through the ministry's book, Parliament warned yesterday.The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee said Mailu will be violating the Constitution by inviting external auditors to verify alleged questionable spending at the ministry.Mailu had at the weekend said the ministry would call in independent auditors to verify claims the ministry had lost Sh3.1 billion.He accused the ministry's internal auditor of leaking an incomplete report to the media, when the management had not responded to the queries raised.Parliamentary Accounts Committee chairman Nicholas Gumbo said inviting an independent auditor is illegal for any government institution."Such an action clearly violates provisions of Article 226 (3) of the Constitution. Under the law, only the Auditor General is mandated to audit government accounts," he said."If he goes ahead and does it, we as the PAC will ensure he is personally surcharged of any of the costs incurred."Only the Auditor General is audited by a "professionally qualified accountant", according to Article 226 (4).Gumbo also said such action from the CS could also lead to removal of office as he would be violating the Constitution. ODM leaders have claimed the government is trying to cover up the alleged scandal by seeking the services of an external auditor.They have said they will not allow another audit other than that which will be done by the Auditor General, once the internal audit is complete.Meanwhile, the National Assembly Committee on Health will today morning grilled Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri over the ministry's 2015-16 budgetary allocations.The alleged scandal in the ministry arises from allocations that the Ministry got during the same financial cycle.The MPs will meet the two regarding the budget implementation by the ministry for the 2015-16 and first quarter of 2016-17.This comes days after the two issued a robust defence against accusations the ministry had lost Sh3.1 billion in fraudulent procurement.The allegations arose from a leaked interim report by the ministry&rsquo;s internal auditor, but the ministry has dismissed the claims.on Tuesday, the Health Committee received a briefing from the Parliamentary Budget Office regarding the budget implementation by the ministry.The ministry has given a brief on how the money queried by the auditor was used, including how a company owned by President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s sister got its tender.
