Four lecturers from Maasai Mara University have been charged in a Narok court with unlawful assembly.They are Anthony Pareiyo, Meshack Lagat, Robert Saidimu and Joshua Bore.They appeared before Narok senior principal magistrate Titus Gesora and were charged with gathering at Arabian Dishes Hotel in Narok town on Friday last week. They denied the charges and were released on Sh10, 000 bond each with surety of a similar amount. The four allegedly congregated with the intention of inciting students to riot. This reportedly led to closure of the institution. The case will be heard on March 2. More than 170 part-time lecturers have been on strike over what they say is non-payment of dues dating back four years and amounting to more than Sh100million. Chairman Joshua Bore, one of the accused, said the lecturers complained to the university but got no response.Their case comes barely a week after 25 students from the same institution were charged in the same court with taking part in a student riot that rocked the university last week.
