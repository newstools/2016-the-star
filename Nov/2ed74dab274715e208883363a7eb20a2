Several civil society groups have asked Uhuru to voluntarily step down for "abetting graft" or face a forced ejection. Haki Africa, Team Courage, Coast Network and Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice said they will launch a revolt if the President stays put. They said on Sunday that they will organise mass protests until the August 8, 2017 general election for Uhuru to be removed from power. The lobbies also said they will push Parliament to "extreme limits" and ensure the President is impeached on grounds that he has failed to end corruption. They said they ensure citizens make Uhuru a one-term leader by voting him out through a secret ballow, should these two approaches fail. &ldquo;We will ensure Uhuru leaves office if he fails to resign,&rdquo; said activist Boniface Mwangi of Team Courage. A demonstration Mwangi led last week turned ugly after police officers beat protesters with batons and fired gunshots to disperse them. There was also an exchange with journalists who were filming police action against the protesters.

He must deal with his sister and take her to jail,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru's sister Nyokabi Kenyatta and cousin Kathleen Kihanya are directors of a company that allegedly pocketed Sh41 million in questionable payouts.

The lobbies called for the firing of all CSs and Principal Secretaries implicated in corruption.&ldquo;We also call for the freezing of all of their personal bank accounts and assets with immediate effect pending investigations,&rdquo; said Khalid.The activists claimed the&nbsp;National Intelligence Service was aware of the grand scams but was covering them up. The gov ernment has claimed some acts against the President in relation to corruption amount to treason. Mwangi said the government initially denied there was an NYS scam and said it was only a matter of time before it said the same about the Mafya House theft. &ldquo;Uhuru had denied the NYS scandal, but Ruto later admitted there was one,&rdquo; he said. The lobbies urged Kenyans to wear red every Thursday as a mark of protest against corruption. &ldquo;The Red Thursday Movement Against Corruption will be a way for the common man or woman to communicate their anger and demand that action be taken to end corruption,&rdquo; said Khalid.
