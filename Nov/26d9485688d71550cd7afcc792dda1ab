The National Council For Persons With Disabilities has urged its members who are registered as voters to back President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2017 poll.Chairman David Ole Sankok said asked those who qualify among the council's 1.5 million members to vote for Uhuru for greater gains going forward.Sankok said he was not following the Jubilee administration blindly, further noting that the current government has helped persons with disabilities through exemption from taxation.He said senior government officials have attended the group's meetings as a sign of commitment of the Jubilee administration towards disadvantaged persons."We have 94 MCAs representing people living with disabilities across the country. Each MCA normally pay taxes amounting to Sh100,000. Those with disabilities don&rsquo;t pay taxes meaning the government has forsaken Sh90 million," Sankok said.Sankok said persons living with disabilities are importing vehicles without paying 42 per cent import duty."This is in addition to being included in the marginalised groups where government has made it a law that 30 per cent of government&rsquo;s procurement be given to youths, women and people living with disabilities," he said.He also asked aspirants selected to lead the Jubilee Party campaigns not to expect any favors during the nomination process.Sankok was named a campaign team member at the Jubilee national delegates conference on Friday last week.He told those seconded to lead vote hunt in their regions not to expect direct nominations.Sankok told journalists said at Maralal Primary School in Samburu central sub-county on Tuesday that the campaign team should not create doubt among Jubilee members."We only need few guys to lead us. It is not that some people selected in the party&rsquo;s campaign team will be favored in the nominations," he said.
