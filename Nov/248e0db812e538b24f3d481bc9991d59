Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto was on Monday airlifted to Nairobi after a police tear gas canister hit him in Bomet on Sunday.The Governor landed at Wilson airport at around 8.50am where he addressed the media before being taken to Nairobi Hospital for check up.He had a swollen face and a red eye.Rutto said police officers threw a teargas canister at him when he asked why some youths had been arrested.He was attending a church service at Njerian AGC, Silibwet Township ward when he received text messages of complaints from youths who were allegedly arrested."The youths claimed that some of them had been arrested by police on suspicion that they were his supporters," said Director of Communications Kiprotich Samoei.He said some boda boda riders went ahead to where Rutto was to raise the same complaint."Rutto was then forced to go to the station and ask the security in charge to release the arrested youths," Samoei said."An argument ensued between him and the police officers [as] a handful of his supporters joined him in asking the police to release the arrested youths."Samoei said an officer tried to hit him with a stick but the Governor s security thwarted the move."Around ten or more police officers retreated and lobbed tear gas canisters directly at the Governor in quick succession," he said.Samoei said Rutto sustained a cut that made him bleed."He was administered first aid on his way home where a doctor dressed the wound," he said.The Council of Governors said on Monday: "Rutto to be airlifted for further medical attention."
