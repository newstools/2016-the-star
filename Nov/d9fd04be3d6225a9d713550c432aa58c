Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang (pictured) has denied claims he will not defend his seat but support governor aspirant Sammy Wakiaga in 2017. He said that is propaganda peddled by his rivals. Kajwang denied that he was approached by Wakiaga to abandon his reelection bid and support the aspirant. In a 2013 pact, Suba, where Kajwang and Wakiaga come from, is supposed to get a Senate seat and Rachuonyo, where Governor Cyprian Awiti comes from, to get the governor s office.
