Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok has asked DP William Ruto to stop interfering in politics and development matters in his county.This is after the DP questioned the use of development funds allocated to Turkana. When a Deputy President lies before the people that he doesn t know where the funds sent to Turkana go, this demonstrates how reckless and uninterested he is on the wellbeing of a people, Nanok said in a statement at the weekend.The governor accused Ruto of sneaking into Turkana to launch a road on Thursday and no county official was invited. At the launch, the DP questioned the use of county funds.Nanok said when he was recently invited to a State House event to speak about the gains of devolution and oil in Turkana, Ruto was aware of the event.He said Ruto had full information on programmes in Turkana and should not lie to the public. Doesn t the DP see what others are seeing in terms of development in Turkana? Nanok said. If this is how counties and the national government are supposed to work, then it is not in the spirit of the constitution on mutual consultation and respect. Nanok said the DP is angry because Jubilee Party was defeated by ODM in the Kalokol ward by-election in Turkana on October 26, despite the Jubilee team using relief food to try and sway voters to elect their candidate. He should know that Turkanas identify with those who are truthful and committed to their cause, not those whose intent is to loot Turkana resources, he said.Turkana respects the Presidency and the executive should respect residents, Nanok said. We will not tolerate political statements that are meant to incite our people, he added.The governor asked the DP to visit the region and see for himself the development projects being implemented instead of exhibiting ignorance publicly .
