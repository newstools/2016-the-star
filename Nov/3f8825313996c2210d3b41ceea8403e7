The agency that regulates salaries for state workers released the first ever job evaluation results of 40,298 jobs in 228 public institutions on Friday.The results from the appraisal indicated that counties have the highest number of job slots for skilled employees at 57 per cent of the evaluated positions. Salaries and Remuneration Commission said the group falls under Band C that categorized supervisors and high level skilled officers.These included senior principal officers, assistant secretaries and deputy directors, accounting for a total of 11,592 slots out of 20,382 county jobs.Teachers were the worse off lot in the civil service where 30 per cent (90,000) slots are Job Group 'G' graded under Band B .This categorizes officers with low level supervisory skills such as interns, drivers and artisans which accounted for a total of 93 job levels in the teaching service.SRC also introduced new level of career path where teachers in administration will be absorbed in Band D .Band D recognizes servants with senior and middle-level management skills such as heads of departments and sectional heads. The results indicated that majority of positions (1,412) in the 21 ministries were Band 'C' jobs accounting for 46.91 per cent of jobs that require employees with supervisory and high level skills.Some 795 others (26.41%) fell under Band 'D' which categorized officers with tactical skills in the rank of directors and their deputies, senior principals, commissioners and assistant commissioners. Band 'B' had 516 job slots, Band 'E' had 269 and only 8 (1%) were under Band 'A'. "This indicates that either there are very few roles in band A or the roles played by those in that grade have been outsourced," the report said. It showed a total of 3,010 jobs were evaluated in all ministries.Majority of jobs (42%) out of 1,881 of those evaluated in 16 of the 18 constitutional commissions were Band C followed by Band B (30%), Band D (21%) and Band E at only 7 per cent. Band E jobs categorized officers in strategic positions such as directors and deputy CEOs. "Thirteen of the 16 institutions in the sector had over 50 per cent of jobs analysed, being from the support functions departments," said the report.In the 102 evaluated state corporations, 44 per cent of the jobs (3,623) were found to be suitable under Band C senior managers, assistant directors and deputy directors while 2,592 jobs (31%) under Band B were found to be suitable for the position of senior officers, supervisors and principal officers. Some 1343 jobs (16%) were categorized under Band D senior and middle management specialists- while 102 jobs (1%) fell under Band E directors and deputy CEOs.Only 689 jobs (8%) were categorized under Band A semi skilled and basic workers such as tea persons and messengers. The report noted that some state corporations were found to have previously had no standardized grading structures; lacked or had poor quality job descriptions; had overlapping or duplicated roles.The evaluation of jobs in commercial and strategic corporations that involved 5,723 jobs across 51 institutions found that 1778 jobs (31%) were under Band B . These include positions such as security officers, HR assistants, clinical officers and lab technologists. Some 849 jobs (15%) were graded under Band A (cooks, drivers, waiters and receptionists) while 2,613 jobs (46%) were under Band C (chief accountants, pharmacists, deputy managers and principal engineers).Seven per cent of jobs (422) were put under Band D .

SRC procured three consultant firms to conduct the exercise. PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted evaluations in constitutional commissions, Independent offices and teaching service and the county governments. Ernest and Young tackled the civil service while Deloite and Touche handled the service and regulatory state corporations and commercial and strategic state corporations.
