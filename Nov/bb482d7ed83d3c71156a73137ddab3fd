Candidates for various positions in the Gor Mahia elections have expressed their dissatisfaction in regard to the singular announcement by the current office that elections will be held in December 11 without their consultation. The candidates among them Chris Omondi, who was elected chairman in the last polls but opted out of office as well as chairmanship aspirant Dan Oketch, said several issues have arisen since the election date was set and do not augur well with the fans, aspirants and other stakeholders. We wish to condemn in the strongest terms possible the manner in which the incumbent office has been handling this issue. First, questions have been raised on the independence and fairness of the body called IFEOS that was appointed to undertake this whole process of registration of voters. The fact that this selection was done in secret makes it even more suspicious, charged a statement signed by ten aspirants, who included Omondi and Oketch as well as Kevin Odhiambo, Mogaka Jared, Joseph ogidi, Sally Bolo, Tom Odongo, Njeria Chito and Judith Anyango.The candidates wondered whether the online registration procedure allegedly being undertaken had followed the requirements of the club s constitution and the Sports Act.
