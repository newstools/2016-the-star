It will be ten weeks, though, before Donald Trump enters the White House as America's 45th president.So what happens after the election takes place?1. The transitionPresident-elect Donald Trump begins the task of preparing to be president. This includes finalising the legislative agenda for the crucial first 100 days in office, receiving policy briefings and selecting key members of the incoming administration, including a chief of staff and the cabinet. Nominations typically come within weeks of election day. The cabinet nominees are confirmed by the senate and sworn into office following the inauguration of the incoming president.2. The 'lame duck' sessionObama will remain in the Oval Office after election day, but will officially become a lame duck president. The term lame duck was used to describe defaulters on the London stock exchange in the 18th century before winding its way into the American political lexicon. Obama has 73 days to tick remaining items off his presidential to-do list- like trying to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal.3. The inaugurationOn January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be sworn in on the steps of the US Capitol. He will then deliver the inaugural address, attend a Congressional luncheon and parade to the White House. While the ceremonies are underway, staff at the White House will be frantically moving out the remnants of the Obama administration, and preparing the residence and offices for their new inhabitants. After a series of inaugural balls and plenty of pomp and circumstance, Trump and his family will at last settle into their new home, and his new job as the 45th President of the United States.
