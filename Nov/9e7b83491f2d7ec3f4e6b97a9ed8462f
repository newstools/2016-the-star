Republican Donald Trump has sensationally won the White House race. &quot;Thank you very much. I have just received a call from secretary&nbsp;Clinton and&nbsp;she congratulated us for our victory and I congratulated her and her family,&quot; he said on Wednesday. Read: Clinton calls President-elect Donald J Trump to concede defeat Speaking at the Trump headquarters, he said he&nbsp;owes Clinton a great debt of&nbsp;service&nbsp;to the American people. &quot;We have to get together ... its time for us to come together as one both Democrats and Republican ... I will be president to all&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;and this is important to me,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s time to work together. I reach out to those who did not support me for we need to work together.&quot; Amid cheers from the crowd, Trump gave a speech that left many of his supporters giggling and laughing their hearts out.&quot;Ours was not a campaign but a movement.&nbsp;This political stuff is nasty and it&#39;s tough!&quot; he said. &quot;We will always put America&rsquo;s interest first but we will deal fairly with everyone.We will seek common ground not hostility. &quot; Trump also took a moment to thank his family, adding that no man or women will be forgotten anymore. &quot;... I love you ... I want to thank my family. I know my parents are looking down on me but i love you all ...&quot; he said. The bizarre ending to Clinton&rsquo;s political career came after Trump confounded pollsters at every turn, capturing one &#39;swing&#39; state after another in a line of toppled dominoes that stretched across three time zones and now ends at the White House. The last to fall was the Keystone State &ndash; after Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Wisconsin all went to the Republican. That gave him 274 votes in the electoral college &ndash; the winner is the first to achieve 270. He is also winning in the popular vote by a more than one per cent margin. Trump also comes into the presidency with Republican control over the Senate and the House of Representatives.
