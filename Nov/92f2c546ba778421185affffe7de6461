Former Foreign Affairs PS Mwangi Thuita has given up efforts to stop the Sh1.75 billion criminal case against him. Counsel Wilfred Nderitu yesterday told the Appeal Court Thuita might have withdrawn the suit, as he was acquitted by the magistrate s court in March. He said, however, the DPP appealed the acquittal by chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali.
