IEBC chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba on Thursday said the agency will be unable to purchase electoral equipment in time as the commission is yet to award the tender.The Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016, states that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is required to use an integrated electronic electoral system.The electoral system includes biometric voter registration kits, electronic voter identification kits and the results transmission system.Chiloba said the commission was required to have purchased the election equipment by December 8, eight months to the general elections. We are behind schedule and it will be impossible to beat the December 8 deadline, because we are yet to award the tender and the deadline has less than two weeks to go, he said.Chiloba said 7,000 of the 15,000 BVR kits that the IEBC acquired ahead of the March 4, 2013, general election have broken down.This left the commission with just about 55 per cent of the total kits that are operational and they required modification to be unified with the EVIDs and RTS. The number of BVRs that can operate at the moment from the last general election is about 8,000 and even with this, we have a challenge as an updated register is required, Chiloba said.In 2013, the IEBC was blamed for shoddy ICT, when its equipment failed to identify voters and send results as planned. Chiloba said they are trying to eliminate this problem next year.The voter registration audit report was supposed to be submitted three months ago to the National Assembly by the IEBC, but has been delayed.The opposition has opposed the purchase of ballot papers, saying it is malicious for the commission to roll out the process before new commissioners are sworn in. The IEBC commissioners selection panel is expected to vet applicants to fill in the positions of the commission on December 15. Early this month, the IEBC selection committee said they had received more than 800 applicants who had sent in their bid for jobs at the commission.The panel is then expected to forward the names of the shortlisted candidates, who will then be presented to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly. On approval by Parliament, the names will be presented to the President for appointment.
