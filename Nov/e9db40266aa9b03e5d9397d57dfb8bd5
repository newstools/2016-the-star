Counties headed by Jubilee governors have also been named by the Auditor General over the loss of money through unsupported expenditure on goods and services, duplicate payments, undeclared bank accounts and undocumented payment of staff.Millions of shillings may have been lost in 2014-15 in President Uhuru Kenyatta s backyard.In Kirinyaga, the county could not provide information to support the expenditure of Sh1.48 billion. The report identified three projects that were over-funded and the Auditor General concluded that public resources were not utilised efficiently and effectively.Kabuti dispensary was allocated Sh2.4 million in the budget but Sh4.4 million was paid.Kianjiru health facility was allocated Sh5.9 million but Sh8.5 million was paid out.There is also unexplained escalation of the cost of construction of mortuaries at the Sagana and Kianyaga subcounty hospitals from Sh4 million each to Sh17.7 million and Sh17.9 million respectively.The report also said the county government spent Sh14.9 million on fuel but no fuel registers were maintained to control and account for the money.In Laikipia, the audit revealed the existence of 24 bank accounts belonging to the county government not connected to IFMIS. The audit also found payments of goods and services worth Sh95.2 million with no supporting documents.In Kiambu, the audit revealed that duplicated receipt numbers for revenue collection amounted to Sh359.5 million. The highest amount of Sh323.7 million was in Thika subcounty, where 54,549 duplicate receipts were discovered.The audit also found that the county government spent Sh11.6 million to convert a ward into a neurosurgery facility at the Kiambu Level 4 Hospital.

Further, the possibility of all officers proceeding on annual leave concurrently in one month is untenable. The payment was therefore unjustified and was paid contrary to the code of regulations, the report said.This is one of the queries that has made the Auditor General conclude that Nyeri county may have misused 47 per cent of all its funds in 2014-15.Nyeri county provided the Auditor General with an expenditure of Sh2.3 billion in the 2014-15 financial year that was unsupported with the relevant schedules and ledger.The Auditor General reports that due to the significance of the unsupported amount, his office is unable to state whether 47 per cent of total county funding was used effectively and in a lawful manner.Meru county assembly speaker, the Auditor General stated, lives in a Sh115,000-a-month house. However, the county assembly paid Sh470,000 to the speaker who is actually the landlord as per the contractual agreement at Sh80,000 per month for November, December 2014 and January 2015 and Sh115,000 for February and March 2015.It further indicates that the payments were not validated with any invoices or documents, which the speaker says had been misplaced when the audit was being conducted.In Embu, county officials pocketed millions of shillings in double payments while on trips to Tanzania.In one instance, the county government spent Sh14.5 million for a five-day trip to Arusha.
