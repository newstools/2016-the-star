Nakuru veteran politician Koigi Wamwere has renewed his political rivalry with the Kihika family.After running for Nakuru North MP against Kihika Kimani in 1979, Koigi is back again and ready to go head-to-head with Kimani s daughter Susan. Koigi will face off with Susan for the Jubilee Party ticket. The two want to be Nakuru s next senator. In 1974, Koigi gave Kihika a run for his money but lost. Five years later, Koigi was at it again with Kihika, vying for the same seat and won. However, Koigi s tenure was cut short after he was detained without trial and his rival Kihika won the by-election.Last Friday, Susan urged Koigi to support her bid. She spoke during a Jubilee Party meeting in Nakuru. Deputy Governor Joseph Ruto was present. Susan is the JP regional presidential campaign coordinator. My father and friend Koigi, who battled it out with my father in the 1970s, I ask you to now support your daughter for the senatorial seat. Just support your small daughter so she can capture the seat, Kihika said.
