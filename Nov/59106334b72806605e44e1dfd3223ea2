Harambee Starlets team manager Doreen Nabwire believes their early arrival in the host city Limbe, Cameroon will give them an edge over their opponents as the 12th edition of the 2016 Africa women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations gets underway next weekend.The team, which left the country last Friday are the only nation that has since arrived in Cameroon ahead of the championship that kicks off from November 19 to December 3 in the cities of Limbe and Yaounde respectively.Nabwire, who doubles up as the national team player was, however, wary of the hot conditions in Limbe but was quick to note that the players are adapting well.She said: &ldquo;The weather here is harsh but the players are slowly but surely adapting. I am happy the Football Kenya Federation management made it possible for the team to pitch camp here well ahead of the event and because of this, the team is motivated.&rdquo;She added: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had the chance to train at the event&rsquo;s facility but we are training at a new stadium called Middle Farm, where participating teams will conduct their training sessions. The morale in the team is high and we can only hope for the best.&rdquo;The team, which has been drawn in Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; alongside Nigeria, Mali and Ghana, wrapped up their series of International friendly matches with 2-1 loss against hosts Cameroon over the weekend.The side, coached by David Ouma, had lost 1-0 during the first leg in Nairobi two weeks earlier.
