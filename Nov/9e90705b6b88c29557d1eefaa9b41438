Cord has called for a "mother of all demonstrations" to mobilise one million Kenyans into the streets of Nairobi on Tuesday over the Afya House scandal.MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), said they spoke on behalf of the coalition. They criticised Jubilee for "overseeing wanton corruption that has seen billions of taxpayers' money looted".They said the opposition is not interested in investigations or further audits as the facts of the theft were laid bare by the internal audit report."They have Saturday, Sunday and Monday to clear their desks and pack their belongings. Come Tuesday, we are going pour into the streets a million supporters for demonstration until they resign," Wandayi said. "We expect law enforcement agencies to move swiftly into Afya House, arrest the culprits and present them before a court of law."Wanga said the alleged involved of companies associated with President Uhuru Kenyatta's relatives is confirmation that the theft is part of a well orchestrated campaign to loot from the public coffers.
