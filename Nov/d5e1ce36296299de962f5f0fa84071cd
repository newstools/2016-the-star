Transport along the Narok-Bomet road was yesterday paralysed for more than two hours after Maasai Mara University students blocked it. The students were protesting against a boda boda rider who assaulted their colleague on Wednesday when he caught him with his cheating wife. “The law is clear he should have reported (the student) to the police rather than take the law in his hands,” a student said. The protesters barricaded the road with rocks and burning tyres at Total in Narok town, leaving tourists visiting Maasai Mara Game Reserve stranded. A boda boda operator caught up in the melee was almost lynched when the students impounded his motorbike. Police, however, lobbed teargas and arrested 10 demonstrators.
