A new digital programme was yesterday launched to enable more than one million youth access online jobs over the next one year. Ajira Digital Programme, which was rolled out by the ICT ministry, aims to introduce Kenyans to online work, and provide the tools, training and mentorship needed to work and earn an income. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said the project will fulfill Jubilee's electoral pledge to create jobs, and is in response to growing market for online work globally. Our target of over one million registered online workers will make Kenya the number one global supplier of online workers, and with that, a significant economic development and reduction of unemployment, Mucheru said during the launch at the KCB s Karen leadership centre. More than 40,000 Kenyans have online jobs, ranking Kenya as the 10th biggest global supplier of online workers, and the first in Africa. The CS was accompanied by Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs CS Sicily Kariuki.
