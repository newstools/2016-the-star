Alfred Mutua has said he will sue Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for linking him to the alleged kidnap of&nbsp; Deputy Governor Benard Kiala&#39;s daughter. Mutua, who is Machakos Governor, told a rally on Friday that he will take legal action against Kalonzo for &quot;mudslinging my name on allegations of murder and kidnap&quot;. &quot;Kalonzo took to the podium and addressed hundreds of people claiming I was involved in the kidnap of my deputy&#39;s child. I will take legal action so he can prove what he said in KIbwezi.&quot; he said in Kitui county. &quot;We cannot let leaders who have no agenda bring politics of intolerance and disrespect.&quot; Kalonzo said last Friday that police should question Mutua on the disappearance of Kiala&rsquo;s daughter last Wednesday. She had been reportedly &nbsp;kidnapped and demands made for the Deputy Governor to drop his 2017 bid for Machakos governor. &nbsp; Assembly majority leader Joshua Mwonga said it was shameful for a respected leader such as Kalonzo to publicly accuse the Governor of kidnapping his deputy&#39;s child.
