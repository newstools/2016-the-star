Alfred Mutua has said he will sue Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for linking him to the alleged kidnap of Deputy Governor Benard Kiala's daughter.Mutua, who is Machakos Governor, told a rally on Friday that he will take legal action against Kalonzo for "mudslinging my name on allegations of murder and kidnap"."Kalonzo took to the podium and addressed hundreds of people claiming I was involved in the kidnap of my deputy's child. I will take legal action so he can prove what he said in KIbwezi." he said in Kitui county."We cannot let leaders who have no agenda bring politics of intolerance and disrespect."Kalonzo said last Friday that police should question Mutua on the disappearance of Kiala&rsquo;s daughter last Wednesday.She had been reportedly kidnapped and demands made for the Deputy Governor to drop his 2017 bid for Machakos governor.Assembly majority leader Joshua Mwonga said it was shameful for a respected leader such as Kalonzo to publicly accuse the Governor of kidnapping his deputy's child.Read: 'Prove Mutua linked to Kiala kid&rsquo;s kidnap'Also read: Release Kiala&rsquo;s daughter or face Kamba curse, kidnappers toldThe girl was found in Sunton, Mwiki on Thursday, by CID officers who said she had not been kidnapped.More on this: Kiala's daughter found in Mwiki, police say she was not kidnappedBelow is the letter from Mutua's lawyers to Kalonzo:
