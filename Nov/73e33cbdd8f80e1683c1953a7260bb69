Meltah scored through Francis Wambura, Muhoto Wilson, Joseph Omassaba and Sammy Agesa.TUK s Steven Odhiambo and striking counterpart Jeconiah Uyoga squandered priceless chances in the opening half, with the latter shooting directly at Patrick Githiga on Meltah s goal in the 34th minute but the keeper who was up to task.After that, Odhiambo had a good combination with Evans Odhiambo on the left wing but he hesitated to pull despite being in front of goal heading into the breather at 0-0. TUK broke the deadlock late in the second half courtesy of 85th minute penalty, calmly converted by Steven Odhiambo after Meltah defender handled the ball within the forbidden area. Moments later, Meltah equalised in similar fashion, slotting from the spot kick after their player was felled within the box.
