West Conference heavyweights Technical University of Kenya will clash with East Conference kings Jericho All Stars in the SportPesa Super 8 Champions League final next month after both sides emerged victorious in their respective semi-finals fixtures played on Sunday at City Stadium.TUK advanced after beating resilient Meltah Kabiria 5-4 in post-match penalty kicks to book a date with Jericho, who defeated arch rivals Shauri Moyo Blue Stars 1-0 in heated encounter.In the first match of the day, the university students were the better side but were made to sweat for the victory after settling for a 1-1 draw in regular time.Phillip Mwathathi, Calvin Odhiambo, Boniface Okomo and Lawrence Agina were perfect in converting their shoot-out to ensure they play in the final due November 13 at Nyayo Stadium. Meltah scored through Francis Wambura, Muhoto Wilson, Joseph Omassaba and Sammy Agesa.TUK&rsquo;s Steven Odhiambo and striking counterpart Jeconiah Uyoga squandered priceless chances in the opening half, with the latter shooting directly at Patrick Githiga on Meltah&rsquo;s goal in the 34th minute but the keeper who was up to task.After that, Odhiambo had a good combination with Evans Odhiambo on the left wing but he hesitated to pull despite being in front of goal heading into the breather at 0-0. TUK broke the deadlock late in the second half courtesy of 85th minute penalty, calmly converted by Steven Odhiambo after Meltah defender handled the ball within the forbidden area. Moments later, Meltah equalised in similar fashion, slotting from the spot kick after their player was felled within the box.
