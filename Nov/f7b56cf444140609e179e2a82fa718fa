Former NYS deputy director general Adan Harakhe suffered a setback yesterday after the High Court dismissed his plea to have his prosecution stopped. The Director of Public Prosecutions can now go ahead to charge him with the alleged loss of Sh47 million. Justice Hedwig Ong&rsquo;undi said Harakhe had failed to show how his rights had been violated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied the applicant has demonstrated sound grounds that can make this court issue the orders sought. I, therefore, dismiss the suit,&rdquo; he said.Her ruling automatically reversed the temporary orders Harakhe had obtained on November 17 against the DPP. The prosecution concerns the procurement irregularities in the award of a tender for the supply of training materials to the NYS. Justice Ong&rsquo;udi said the DPP has powers to institute criminal charges against suspects. She said it was not in dispute Harakhe was the accounting officer and was the AIE Holder.Similarly, former chairman of the Ministerial Tender Committee Hassan Noor lost his bid to block his prosecution before justice Lydia Achode. The DPP says there is sufficient evidence to charge the two with abuse of office.
