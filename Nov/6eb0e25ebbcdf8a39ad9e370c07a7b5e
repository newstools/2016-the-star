A group of elders from Wajir West subcounty have urged the government to dissolve Eldas constituency.They yesterday said perennial clashes over the constituency&rsquo;s boundaries have caused many deaths.The elders blamed Eldas MP Adan Keynan for clashes since 2013.Last weekend&rsquo;s inter clan clashes in Baqala location killed eight people.&ldquo;The Baqala clashes are an example of Keynan&rsquo;s expansionist enterprises in Eldas,&rdquo; elders&rsquo; spokesman Abdi Salat said.He said the eight people were killed by armed militants from Eldas. Salat urged the state to prosecute the culprits. He said the clashes erupted after Keynan tried to expand the Eldas boundary and create a settlement for his clan in Wajir West.&ldquo;Eldas is a very small constituency compared to the others. The MP wants to expand it using violence,&rdquo; Salat said.He blamed Keynan for clashes in Wajir North, South and West constituencies.&ldquo;The conflict in Baqala is nothing new. It falls in a clear pattern where the MP wants to fight everybody in his quest to push the boundary of his constituency,&rdquo; Salat said.&ldquo;The perpetrators are well known to security agencies. They must be apprehended and face justice.&rdquo;They urged the government to enforce peace.In August, there was tension on the border between Eldas and Wajir North constituencies following the killing of four people. The Degodia clan in Eldas and the Ajurans in Wajir North fought each other.
