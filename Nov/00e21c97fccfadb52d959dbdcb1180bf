Top-tier Standard Chartered Bank has partnered with four major hotels in a Sh15 million campaign aimed at tapping high net-worth hotel guests into the lender's wealth management products. Head of retail banking David Idoru said it is part of the bank's strategy to diversify its revenue streams in the wake of rate caps enforced in mid September. &ldquo;We are looking at two things; that is deepening our relationships with our clients, and increasing our penetration of our wealth products,&rdquo; Idoru said.The lender seeks to increase customer wealth directly by encouraging investment in local bonds, foreign bonds and mutual funds, while also providing wealth protection products. The campaign running from November 7 to January 7, 2017, will reward 150 customers with vacation packages from Sarova Group, Serena Group of Hotels, Kempinski hotels and Acacia Premier.
