The Wajir government s efforts to sink boreholes have helped resolve conflict, Water chief officer Abdinoor Hussein has said. One hundred and thirty-six boreholes have been sunk. A lot of conflict arises due to fights for the little water available that both animals and residents use. The county s intention was to quench the thirst of suffering residents moving far and wide in search of water. We also wanted to reduce the conflicts that were a result of fights over water, Hussein said yesterday. COUNTY NOT AS HARD HIT BY DROUGHTA National Drought Management Authority report shows Wajir has not been as hard hit by drought as Mandera and Garissa counties. PRAISE FOR SUNKEN BOREHOLEResident Abdi Mohamed of Tarbaj constituency said, If there is one good thing the county has ever done for us, it is to sink boreholes. As a pastoralist, all I am interested in is having a place where I can take my animals for water. That has been made available to me by the county thanks to devolution. President Uhuru Kenyatta toured the county in April. He said devolution is working in Wajir.Early this month, Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye urged the government to buy livestock from pastoralists in drought-stricken regions in Northeastern through the Livestock Off-take Programme.He said hundreds of emaciated animals have already died.
