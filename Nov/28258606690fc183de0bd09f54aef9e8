The drought and famine in Kenya is a result of society turning away from God and becoming evil, Muslim clerics in Mombasa have said. Led by Sheikh Khalifa Mohamed, they urged Kenyans to repent to avoid further punishment from God.Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir (pictured), who attended the prayers, said all Kenyans must cleanse themselves and pray. We must also help out where we can. This cry for food is real and we should not ignore it, he said.The two spoke as thousands of Muslims held special prayers for rain, known as Salat Al-Istisqa, in the Makadara Grounds, Mombasa. They also sought forgiveness from God. The prayers were organised by the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya. People have to repent. Religiously, drought is caused by increase in sin. There is too much bloodshed in the country. Raping, indecency, theft and corruption have become too much. God is not happy, Sheikh Khalifa said. Let us stop bringing musicians who have no morals to the country... Respect among Kenyans has gone to the dogs. Let us repent. God is always ready to accept us back so that he can give us rain and blessings. As if a divine sign to encourage people to turn back to God, Mwakirunge areas in Kisauni constituency received showers on Thursday morning as the prayers were conducted in Mombasa. I am in Mwakirunge and there is rain already. Is this a coincidence? Da Amina, a resident of Mombasa, said.Supkem s Sheikh Modhar Khitamy said clerics should lead Kenyans back to God. This can only be possible if we begin with the people in authority, who have to be cleansed of corruption and other ills, he said.
