The Mihango-Kayole link road was reopened on Wednesday after a month-long dispute between the Nairobi government and the military.The road passes through disputed 5,000 acres in Embakasi, Nairobi.The road was reopened a day after the county government obtained a court order barring the Kenya Defence Forces from interfering with the road.Kidero, who was scheduled to reopen the road but cancelled at the last minute, said the land belongs to the county and KDF whimsically acquired it . It had to take the intervention of the President, despite a court order, for KDF to reopen the access route, he said in a statement.Three weeks ago, soldiers from Embakasi Garrison had dug trenches, cutting off the road that serves thousands of people from Kayole and Mihango estates. Last Friday, they kicked out more than 500 quarry workers from the land.On Wednesday, Jubilee politicians led by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale inspected the site. Duale said the land belongs to the KDF. He said, however, they had resolved that the KDF will fence the land except for the section where the road passes.
