Nurses in Elgeyo Marakwet have threatened to skip work if the county does not implement promotions and hire more nurses in 10 days. County union secretary general Benson Biwott said nurses will go on strike from December 4 if the county government will not hire at least 273 nurses. Medics are overworked due to an acute shortage of nurses in the county, they said. Biwott accused the county of failure to sign a collective bargaining agreement to promote nurses and hike their salaries. We have had issues of promotions and re-designations. Our nurses are tired of waiting, he said. Nurses have held several meetings with the county executive but their issues have not been addressed, Biwott said. We have been taken round in circles for more than two years, he said. It has emerged that some dispensaries in the county are manned by only one nurse, who often close the facilities when they are on leave.
