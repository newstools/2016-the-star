I have occasionally had the opportunity to give a lecture on foreign aid to an audience at some Western European or North American college campus.And my favourite case study at such events is that of the establishment of the Kenya Utalii College in the early 70s, through assistance from the Swiss government.To understand why this is an example of real significance, you first have to ask yourself: What kind of economy did the Kenya Colony of our pre-Independence years have? And the answer of course is that it was an economy designed very specifically for the benefit of a few thousand large-scale farmers, of the class that used to be referred to as white settlers .These settlers were also supported by a mostly white Civil Service.Within this grand design, the Kenyan Asian community was the dukawallah class of small-scale traders and shopkeepers (and there were active steps taken to discourage them from entering the professions). And the indigenous tribes were designated as providers of manual labour (and, as such, their opportunities for advancement were even more limited than that of the Asian community in colonial Kenya).In short, the opportunities for education and training were largely structured to perpetuate this system of economic apartheid, with a rigidly enforced colour bar also added to keep the Asians, as well as the indigenous communities, in their place.This is why when Kenya got its Independence, and many of the white civil servants opted to return to the UK, there was such a huge skills gap in the nation that we were only saved from collapse by short-term schemes like the famous students airlift project that sent thousands of promising young Kenyans to the US for college education.Two of the Kenyans with greatest global fame the late Professor Wangari Maathai and the late Barack Obama Senior were beneficiaries of this scheme.But filling in these vacancies in various professions created by the departure of British technocrats was actually the easier part of it. Expanding the economy beyond its earlier colonial focus on cash crops was not so easy. And this is where the Swiss came in.Kenya s potential as a tourist destination had actually been noted long before Independence. But it was noted in the lazy casual manner of colonial governors who did not feel burdened to create economic opportunity for the natives .However, a popularly elected African government had to approach the whole thing differently. Jobs had to be created for the growing population of educated Kenyans, who would certainly not be content to return to the land as small-scale farmers after years spent in a modern classroom. Their definition of economic opportunity was tied to paid employment, rather than rudimentary, backbreaking farming.Tourism offered an immediate solution, as Kenya already had potential investors in this sector Americans and Europeans who were keen to extend their well-established hotel chains into the newly independent country.And that is where the need for what we now refer to as capacity building came in.The building and management of the hotels and lodges that constitute the hospitality sector may well be best left to private investors, then as now. But in tourism, as in other sectors, a certain surplus of skilled manpower is needed if you are to compete effectively in a global market. A lower income Kenyan setting out for a quick matatu trip to Nyeri who stops by for a cup of tea in the River Road area, may well be satisfied with the service at one of the many small restaurants in that area. But a middle-class Kenyan on a holiday at the Coast expects something very different at the beach hotel his family may be staying at.Well, back in the 1960s, we had many Kenyans who could serve as waiters at the first type of establishment. But relatively few who could work efficiently at a 100-bedroom beach resort or city five-star hotel like the gleaming new Nairobi Intercontinental or the Nairobi Hilton (famously the tallest building in East Africa when it was first opened).Utalii College was the inspired solution to this problem of creating local skilled manpower for the hospitality sector. And in its early years (ie the 1970s) admission into Utalii College s hotel management course was only slightly less difficult than admission to the ultra-prestigious University of Nairobi (back then the only university in the country).There are four other significant things to be noted about Utalii College: First that it did not only train Kenyans, but also students from neighbouring countries, thus extending the benefits of this training in hospitality at various levels to the entire East African region. At to this day as far as I am aware it remains the leading regional training institution for the hospitality sector.Second is that even if the Swiss had never after that participated in any other development project here in Kenya beyond Utalii College, this one project alone would have put us deeply in their debt. For this was a truly transformational project: It allowed a newly independent nation to open up an entire new field of economic opportunity for its youth, and move it from the cottage industry scale that existed until the 1960s, to a fully industrial strength globally competitive economic sector.Third is that the evidence of the real extent of the success of Kenya s tourism sector is in the fact that whereas back in the 1970s virtually all top hotel management within Kenya was dominated by Swiss and German managers, we now find that in many neighbouring countries (Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda) the top hotel management cadres are very often dominated by Kenyans.And finally, although there is a half-baked attempt, mired in corruption, to set up a new Utalii College campus at the Coast, sponsored by the government, the private sector is already well ahead in this matter of offering training for the hospitality sector. On weekends in particular, you can barely turn a page in the local newspapers without seeing an advertisement for this or that college of hospitality , some of which may well provide training of dubious quality, but a good number of which are, in their own right, centres of excellence.In short, what Kenya needed from the Swiss the preeminent benchmark of excellence in the global hospitality sector was not that they should hold our hand indefinitely. But rather that they should provide us with the capacity building infrastructure that would serve as a catalyst for our own efforts in that sector.That is what the best of foreign aid projects do. And Utalii College also disproves the frequent allegation of aid critics, that foreign aid serves to cultivate dependency in the recipient nation, and to hold us back from ever competing with the nations who give us aid.Think of all those many Swiss hotel managers of the 1980s, employed on the most enviable expatriate terms (free education for the kids; two nice cars, including an SUV for weekend travel; a baronial home with a swimming pool) who then had to return to Switzerland when Kenyans who had trained at the Swiss-supported Utalii College turned up to take their jobs (at much lower salaries and dwellings, of course).Where is the dependency in that? How can we possibly claim that the Swiss helped set up Utalii College, and graciously shared their hospitality expertise with us over the years, in order to hold us back ?It is from such a perspective, then, that we should weigh the recent decision of The Netherlands government to slowly phase out their generous aid programmes to Kenya by the year 2020.The Dutch government is merely responding rationally to the fact that Kenya is no longer as poor as it once was. And this should be cause for pride, not anger out of a feeling that we are being denied aid which helped the poorest of the poor .Our government can actually do a lot to help those seriously poor Kenyans: And the county governments under devolution have been empowered to do even more.In concluding, I should mention that, about two years ago, I attended a conference in Tokyo which was both celebrating and assessing 60 years of Japanese Overseas Development Assistance. I was rather surprised to learn that prior to 1954 Japan had actually been a net recipient of just such ODA. But it was explained that Japan a fairly prosperous nation in the early part of the 20th century had seen its industrial base totally decimated by carpet-bombing, during the Second World War, and its hardworking population reduced to utter destitution.And yet within the decade beginning from the end of that war, Japan moved from receiving aid to being able to contribute to the assistance of poorer nations.We in Kenya know very well what the benefits of Japanese aid have been: From brand-new institutions built from scratch, like the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology; to the iconic series of ultra-modern bridges at the Coast (the Nyali Bridge, Mtwapa Bridge, Kilifi Bridge, Sabaki Bridge) which played an indispensable part in opening up the region to tourism.All these are examples of human or infrastructural capacity building that was provided by a friendly nation, at a time when we could not hope to carry the burden of creating them by ourselves.But this does not mean that we will always be this helpless: With time, there is no reason why Kenya should not be prosperous enough to tackle all its development needs from its own tax collections. Indeed, we are almost there, with the Kenya Revenue Authority regularly reminding us that 97 per cent of our annual Budget is met from internal tax collections.It is only fair then that the donor nations increasingly turn their attention to our poorer neighbours, some of whom rely on such donors for up to 30 per cent of their annual budgetary needs.
