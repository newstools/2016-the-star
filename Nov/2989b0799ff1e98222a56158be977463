Kisumu senator Anyang' Nyong'o, the architect of the anti-Harambee law, has 'eaten the humble pie' and is now participating in public fund raising.This is contrary to what he has unsuccessfully sought to regulate on grounds of being conduits for disposal of stolen public cash.Nyong'o, a fierce critic of harambees, has for the last two months been actively involved in high-profile events to raise money in aid of various groups.He drafted and sponsored the Public Fundraising Bill, 2014 - a proposed law with far-reaching implications aimed at providing a legal framework for harambees.Read: Senate to debate law requiring harambees to be licenced The bill has already been passed by the Senate but was shot down by the National Assembly on October 5 and is now with the House's Joint Mediation Committee to iron out contentious clauses.MPs cited a controversial clause compelling organisers to apply for a license every time before conducting a fundraiser, for whatever reason, as reason for shooting it down.On Sunday, Nyong'o who has heavily criticised Harambees, was at Nyakoko Primary school in Miwani for a fundraiser towards helping needy students."Together, we can achieve more and change our county for better," he posted on his official Facebook page.On November 11, Senator Nyong'o held a meeting with bodaboda riders in Kisumu Central sub-county.This was before he went to Nyakach for a fundraiser in support of Andingo Opanga secondary school."Together we can reach any height and achieve every goals we set. We appreciate everyone who turned up," Nyong'o said in his post after the events.With less than 9 months to the 2017 polls, Nyong'o on October 30 also presided over a fundraising to purchase a mini bus for Obwolo motorcycle sacco in Kajulu ward, Kisumu East sub-county."The sacco is one of the most organised among those run by boda boda operators in the county. We believe that their hard work, determination and ambition should be supported and encouraged. We thank everyone who turned up to make it a success," Nyong'o said.The senator has set his eyes on the Kisumu governor seat and will battle it out with the incumbent Jack Ranguma for the ODM ticket at the party primaries.
