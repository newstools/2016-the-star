Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has said that he enjoyed the light moments made about him on social media as he went for further treatment in South Africa. Rutto who jetted back into the country Friday evening said he was discharged after a successful operation. “I also enjoyed the light moments when I saw some joking with Elastoplast on social media. It was a good idea to symbolise that we should not joke around with police brutality against other Kenyans,” he said. Rutto, who was welcomed by some of his supporters at JKIA, appeared to be shedding tears of joy. He said the decision to seek treatment in South Africa came due to specialists’ advice for him to have surgery in seven days’ time. Due to the time constraints, he settled for South Africa.

Rutto said he was hurt by a teargas canister on the face which broke a number of bones in the nasal area and cheeks. “If you were to look at the xray it was a mess of cracks.” He said. He thanked Kenyans for their support while he was away. The Bomet Governor sustained injuries at a chaotic football tournament at Silibwet Stadium where some youth were arrested allegedly for being his supporters. He is expected to receive a heroic welcome on Saturday by his supporters in Bomet.
