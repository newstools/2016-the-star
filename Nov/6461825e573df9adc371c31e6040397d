Boda boda operators in Nairobi on Monday said they will appeal a court ruling that gave City Hall the greenlight to remove them from the CBD.Last week, Justice Joseph Onguto ruled in favour of City Hall, saying the operators had not proved to the court that the county violated their rights when it banned them from the CBD.More on this read: Boda boda operators banned from Nairobi CBDNairobi boda boda association chairman Ken Onyango said they are not satisfied with Justice Onguto s ruling."We have been meeting since last week and we have even instructed our lawyer to appeal the ruling on our behalf. We believe the ruling was harsh because this is our source of livelihood," Onyango said.The boda boda riders had moved to court early in the year after the county government kicked them out of the city centre in September 2015."Pursuant to the provisions of the Traffic Act CAP 403 of 2014 of the Laws of the Republic of Kenya, the Nairobi City county government wishes to inform all motorcycle (boda-boda) ferrying passengers to and from the CBD that such activities have been banned with immediate effect," a notice by Governor Evans Kidero issued at that time said.Kidero also warned that any operators and passenger found contravening the law would be arrested and prosecuted.But the operators moved to court on grounds that their rights to do business in the city had been violated. The group said the business is their only source of income and kicking them out of CBD would be unfair and discriminatory.A spot check by the Star showed that the operators are still operating in CBD despite the directive in the court ruling.
