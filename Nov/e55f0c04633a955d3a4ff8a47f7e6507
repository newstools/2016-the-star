Nine months spent toiling in the sun or in the rain for 90 minutes every other weekend may just bear fruit for one of Sportpesa Premier League leaders Tusker or champions Gor Mahia.The two engage in crucial fixtures this weekend as the battle for the league title takes centre stage. It is straight forward for Tusker who will be in Nakuru&rsquo;s Afraha stadium to face AFC Leopards knowing victory, regardless of how Gor perform, will bring them an 11th national top flight title.All omens seem to be in favour of Paul Nkata&rsquo;s brewers as Leopards will be without several key layers who have, reportedly, been suspended by the club for disciplinary reasons. Among them is goalkeeper Lucas Indeche and right back Edwin Wafula &ndash; key players for Leopards without whom a result against the brewers might look impossible. Though it will be Stewart Hall&rsquo;s first match in charge since being appointed at the back end of last month, its hard to see how a depleted Leopards outfit with little to fight for in the campaign can stop the Tusker Juggernaut.To have any chance of aiding their arch rival and halt the brewers in their tracks Ingwe will first have to deal with their two former players Alan Wanga and Noah Wafula whose goals have taken the brewers to the verge of winning the championship. Gor know their destiny is no longer in their hands but are going about the business of holding onto the win they have made their own in the last three season in professional fashion. The record league winners will be in Kisumu today to tackle Muhoroni Youth hoping to pick all three points. They will also pray their rivals for this year&rsquo;s crown drop points to take the title fight to a winner take all top of the table duel in a fortnight.With leading striker Jacques Tuyisenge having broken his second leg goal scoring duck, Gor will be They will be going flat out for all three points in a difficult trip to Bandari .The visitors thumped the dockers 2-0 in their first leg fixture, and even more ominously, are unbeaten in their last seven games.Bandari goalkeeper Wilson Obungu was sent off in their match against Posta Rangers last weekend and is therefore suspended for this fixture.Ulinzi Stars are also pushing for a third place finish and should come out all guns blazing against Kakamega Homeboyz.The two teams played to a 1-1 draw in their first leg fixture, and a similar result looks likely looking at their recent forms.Ulinzi&rsquo;s lead striker John Mark Makwatta will be looking to add onto his goal tally of 13 in order to maintain his position at the top of the goal scorers&rsquo; list.
