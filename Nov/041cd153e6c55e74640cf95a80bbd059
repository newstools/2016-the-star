Batting blunders continued to haunt Kenyans as visiting Hong Kong ran away with victory in the ICC World Cricket League matches.After losing in similar fashion against Papua New Guinea in May this year, cricket followers in the country had expected Kenya to rise to the occasion against Hong Kong.However, it turnout to be a case of survival and big disappointment as the hosts continued to blow hot and cold in the second consecutive series.Hopes were high on Sunday as Kenyans comfortably sat at 80 for 0 in pursuit for 173. However, the team lost 10 wickets for 53 runs to rekindle the memories of their disappointing loss to Papua New Guinea, where they lost 18 runs for six wickets while safely on 210 for 4 in pursuit for 250 runs.Consistency, especially with the bat, is an area Kenya will need to work on if they are to qualify for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Bangladesh next year.After beating Hong Kong in the first match by three wickets on Friday, Kenya needed to win the second match to stay on course for qualification as they seek a return to One Day International status.But just as it was the case in the first match, the team failed to capitalise on the good start from the openers Alex Obanda and Irfan Karim, falling easily in the second match.Captain Rakep Patel, who was expected to lead Kenya from the front after a good season, put on a disappointing show, only scoring four runs in two innings. His club mate Dhiren Gondaria looked set to take on the bowlers but failed when it mattered most. Another Kanbis player Narendra Kalyan, who was drafted in the team to boost the batting, was equally no better and even the way he was dismissed on Sunday left the huge crowds that turned out for the match in shock.Gurdeep Singh looked poised to take on the Hong Kong bowlers but inexperienced worked against him.Despite batting blunders, bowling remains Kenya s strong point irrespective of some good hitting from Hong Kong s Barbar Hayat in the second match and Anshumath Rath in the first.Truth be said all the bowlers came to the party and put on a good fight. Nelson Odhiambo was the star bowler in the opening match with three top order wickets before the skipper chipped in with his best bowling figures of 5 for 16 in 6 overs.In the second match, Lucas Oluoch was the star with three of the four wickets that Kenya picked before the match was stopped with the board on 148 in 25 overs.
