Kiambu Governor William Kabogo on Wednesday urged youth to go into fish farming because many people have realised the nutritional value of fish. He said the demand for fish has been on the rise, despite low supply to the market. Kabogo said the available ponds in the county cannot demand, so it is necessary for jobless youths to take up the challenge. He said the venture does not require extensive land and the government provides financial and technical support for fish farmers. The governor said the state supplied farmers with 1,000 mono-sex fingerlings and 10,000kgs of fish feed. Kabogo said the county produces 50 tonnes of fish annually, yet it has only 600 fish farmers. We have idle young people with pieces of land where they can practice aquaculture. We have supported fish farmers with water pumps, pond liners and green houses. They also get training from agricultural officers, he said. We encourage those who do not have financial support to borrow from our Biashara Fund. It has supported a lot of farmers and traders to start and boost their activities.
