Three suspects arrested in connection with the burglary at Equity Bank Kayole branch were taken to Makadara Court on Tuesday.The trio were not charged on grounds that police had not concluded investigations.Winfred Wangechi, David Mwangi and Zablon Mudari will be detained at Kayole police station until Wednesday.It is then that the court will set their bond terms as police continue with investigations into the bank heist.DCI officers from Kayole had requested to hold the suspects for five days as probe into the meticulously planned and excellently executed theft continues.But principal magistrate Stephen Jalang'o declined the request, instead gave the police one day to apprehend the suspects.Mwangi, a staff of Jamka Security Services, was arrested on Monday. He was the guard on duty at the house from which the burglars broke into the bank.Wangechi works for the optician who hived off a section of his premises and sublet the same to another tenant. The room subdivided by the optician had been rented to a man who claimed to have wanted to set a up photocopier business in October.The said shop had remained closed despite the tenant paying rent for the said month. A caretaker of the premises from which the burglars gained access to the bank earlier told detectives that he was not aware that the space had been sublet to a third party.The theft at Equity bank is believed to have been executed for six hours between 8pm Saturday and 2am Sunday.Neither Wells Fargo security guards nor neighbours knew of the incident until detectives from Kayole arrived at the bank on Sunday at 11am.Nairobi police commander Japheth Koome said no money has been recovered even after the arrest of the three suspects. He did not disclose the connection between the three and the theft or whether police had established leads towards the recovery of the stolen money."I may not want to comment on a matter under active investigations," Koome told the Star on phone.Read: Robbers break into Kayole Equity Bank, steal ATM machine with cash
