The giant Dock Workers Union has rejoined Cotu, two years after ditching it for the Trade Union Congress of Kenya.In October 2014, DWU, led by secretary general Simon Sang, amended its constitution to allow it to ditch Cotu for TUC-K. Some members opposed this and went to the Industrial Court in Mombasa to block it. They said the meeting was illegal and they had not been given enough time to read the proposed amendmentThey said the union had more than 5,000 members, but only 900 attended the meeting where the amendment was passed. Judge James Rika dismissed the application.But the DWU has now ditched TUC-K. Sang said the decision was sparked by non-performance of the outfit . We had much expectation when we joined TUC-K, but it has really disappointed us, especially the way it dealt with the dismissal of 28 DWU officials from the port in July last year, he said. Sang said the decision was reached during an executive committee meeting on October 24. He said Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has formally been informed of the new development and proceedings commenced to reverse the 2014 amendment.
