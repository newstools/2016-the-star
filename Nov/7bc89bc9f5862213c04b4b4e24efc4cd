Former National Irrigation Board general manager Daniel Baraza yesterday announced his bid for Busia governor. He said he has the experience, skills and determination to lead the county. Baraza spoke to the Star in Busia town. He said he will ensure the county is &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; from the poor leadership of Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Baraza, who is allied to Jubilee, said Busia is underdeveloped because the current leaders &ldquo;lack vision&rdquo;. &ldquo;Devolution was about taking resources to the people. But here in Busia, little has been achieved, especially in health,&rdquo; he said. Baraza said Ojaamong has been engaging in endless politics at the expense of serving residents. He asked Busia residents to support the Jubilee Party. &ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have good intentions for the country. The only challenge is that a few people let them down,&rdquo; Baraza said.
