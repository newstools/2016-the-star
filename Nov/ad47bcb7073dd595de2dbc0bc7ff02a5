Anne Waiguru has adversely mentioned Deputy President William Ruto's aide in the Sh1.6 billion NYS theft.The former CS, who appeared before the PAC on Thursday, said Farouk Kibet and other NYS suspects communicated frequently before the scam was exposed."There were 150 calls between Kibet and businessman Ben Gethi in the weeks preceding the NYS scam," she said.Records submitted to the committee showed Kibet received Sh1 million from Gethi.Waiguru also pointed fingers at former NYS director Nelson Githinji and former finance director Samuel Wachenje as part of a network used to steal from NYS.Presenting a well drawn graph to the committee members, the ex-CS showed the frequency of calls between various individuals named in the scam, but distanced herself.Waiguru noted the affidavit she filed, that mentioned Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and others, was misinterpreted.She said she was responding to businesswoman Josephine Kabura's damning affidavit about her. "On businessman Ben Gethi, Majority leader Aden Duale and Murkomen, I was responding to Kabura's affidavit, not who stole money," she said.Read: Waiguru was behind NYS deals - Josephine Kabura DP William Ruto's aide Farouk Kibet.
