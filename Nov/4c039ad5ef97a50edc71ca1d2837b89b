Masai Mara University students burned tyres and piled rocks on the busy Narok-Bomet road on Thursday, causing a snarl-up that lasted at least two hours.They barricaded the road at Total area in Narok town in a demonstration against mistreatment and harassment by boda boda operators.The students claimed one of them was seriously injured by a rider in a case of a love triangle. Our schoolmate is said to have been having an affair with the wife of the boda boda rider. This time round he was not lucky; he was caught red-handed by the man on Wednesday night and beaten senseless, said a student who did not want to be named. The law is clear he should have reported (the student) to police rather than take the law into his own hands."Police lobbed tear gas canisters to disperse the students who destroyed one of the boda boda operator's motorcyle. They almost lynched the man but officers intervened.The students also smashed a vehicle's windscreen and threw stones at motorists who tried to avoid them.Drivers were forced to find alternative routes. Commuters including tourists visiting Masai Mara Game Reserve were left stranded int he twon.Sources at Narok County Referral Hospital said the student who was beaten was admitted with head injuries but was responding well to treatment.County AP commander Lawrence Owino, who led officers in ending the protest, said more than 10 students were arrested.He said they will be taken to court for maliciously damaging property.
