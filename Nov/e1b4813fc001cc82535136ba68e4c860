Ivory Coast's top court on Friday validated the results of a referendum backing a new constitution that President Alassane Ouattara says will help the country turn the page after a decade of political turmoil."The constitutional project is adopted," said Mamadou Kone, president of the constitutional court. He rejected a request to annul the referendum from several political parties who boycotted the vote, including that of former president Laurent Gbagbo.An overwhelming majority of voters in Sunday's vote supported the constitution, which institutes a new post of vice president among other changes. Turnout was around 42 per cent.The issue of the constitution, drafted under military rule after a 1999 coup, was at the heart of Ivory Coast's upheaval.Its most controversial clause said that both parents of presidential candidates must be natural-born Ivorians, a swipe at northerners, many of whom, like Ouattara, have family ties that straddle the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali.The new constitution scraps that provision, which was used to disqualify Ouattara from an election in 2000, and now only one parent must be Ivorian.Ivory Coast, the world's top producer of cocoa, has become one of Africa's rising economic stars since 2011 when a civil war ended.Under Ouattara, the country has made an impressive recovery since the civil war capped a decade-long crisis. The International Monetary Fund projects it will be Africa's fastest growing economy this year.But despite five years of peace, Ivorians remain deeply divided along political and ethnic faultlines. And both they and the investors who are now flooding in crave the stability that will allow the world's top cocoa grower to cement its status as the continent's rising star.Opposition had parties called for a boycott of the vote, arguing that the new text was designed to further entrench Ouattara's political coalition.Some called upon their supporters to act to stop the referendum from being held - and a low turnout could rob what is expected to be a "Yes" vote of legitimacy in the future.
