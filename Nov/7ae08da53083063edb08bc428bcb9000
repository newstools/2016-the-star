Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has quit Jubilee saying &ldquo;There is too much graft in the government.&rdquo;He said on Wednesday he will defend his seat either as an independent candidate or he might join another party.Keter launched a scathing attack on President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, saying the country&rsquo;s economy is collapsing because of graft. &ldquo;You can quote me on this. Anyone you see supporting Jubilee is either stupid or corrupt,&rdquo; he said.Keter likened the alleged graft in the government to a cancer eating away at the country.&ldquo;The other name of Jubilee is corruption and you cannot describe corruption in Kenya without calling it Jubilee. I mean Jubilee and corruption are one and the same,&rdquo; he said during an interview with the Star in Eldoret town.Keter urged Kenyans to vote out Uhuru and Ruto. &ldquo;We should now be talking about their replacement with someone who will help Kenyans because definitely it&rsquo;s not Uhuru and Ruto. They have not done anything for this country,&rdquo; he said.He accused Uhuru and Ruto of playing the tribal card, using Kalenjins and Kikuyus.&ldquo;They have been telling us that Kalenjins will take over in 2022 and Kikuyus are in it but they have not been mismanaging the country&rsquo;s resources on behalf of their communities,&rdquo; Keter said.More on this: Ignore Jubilee's 'fake' promises ahead of March 7 by-poll, Alfred Keter tells KerichoRead: Jubilee 'will lose' in 2017 - KeterHe alleged top state officials - whom he did not name - have looted cash and used it to build malls in South Africa and Dubai. Keter said the officials will flee the county &ldquo;once the economy collapses&rdquo;. Keter said Uhuru has failed to offer the political goodwill to fight graft. &ldquo;Even institutions like the EACC are now part and parcel of graft so they cannot fight corruption,&rdquo; he said.Keter said he had been branded a warmonger and a broker because he speaks against graft. He said he has nothing personal against anyone.Keter said all those who &ldquo;mocked&rdquo; him including Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, majority leader Aden Duale and Ruto&rsquo;s aide Farouk Kibet have been linked to the NYS scam.&ldquo;Someone like Farouk was a mere nominated councilor in Eldoret before becoming Ruto&rsquo;s aide, but, within a short time, he has been coming to my constituency for harambees and giving donations of more than Sh1 million,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kibet has admitted that he handled part of the NYS cash and even just by that fact he should have been charged, because handling stolen property is a crime,&rdquo; Keter said. He said the President has openly told Kenyans he is helpless in the war on graft &ldquo;yet he has powers to ensure all those involved in graft are arrested&rdquo;. Keter denied he is involved in a political battle with Ruto. &ldquo;What I know is that he is the DP and I am the MP for Nandi Hills. I don&rsquo;t need to have any other relationship with him because he is neither my brother nor my cousin,&rdquo; he said.
