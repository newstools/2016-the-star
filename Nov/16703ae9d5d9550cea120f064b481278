Thirty five illegal gambling machines were confiscated and 19 suspects arrested in Maralal town on Sunday.Samburu Central deputy OCPD Nathan Sanya said the practice caused children to steal from their parents.Sanya further said gambling was encouraging laziness among the youth as they try to make money out of luck."As you are aware schools have closed. Young girls and boys are wasting away money at illegal gambling joints," he told the press.He noted that they could instead engage in productive activities.The OCPD said the operation will continue to assist parents in disciplining their children and making sure Maralal town is a crime-free zone.Samburu county police commander Francis Kumut said the operation was part of the ongoing national swoop aimed at restoring sanity and ending the addiction to gambling.Kumut asked club owners to obtain licences for operations; he said most clubs and bars in Samburu Central operate illegally yet round-the-clock, but that all of them will eventually be shut down.The 19 suspects will be taken to court on Monday.Read: Four Chinese nationals arrested, 112 gambling machines found in KisumuAlso read: Parents, tutors protest against betting mania
