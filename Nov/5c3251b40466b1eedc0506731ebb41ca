An upmarket bar and restaurant along Ngong Road yesterday challenged in court a decision by the Liquor Licensing Board that revoked its business permit.Space Bar Lounge and Grill Limited says the revocation of its single business permit, rejection of alcoholic drinks license and closure of its business are unfair, unreasonable and in bad faith. It wants the court to direct the Board and Nairobi county to restore its business permit and issue it with the alcoholic drinks license it had applied for.Through lawyer Samuel Akolo, bar director John Gotonga says he was dismayed to see on social media a notice from the county Liquor Board rejecting his application for a licence and ordering him to cease operation, saying his business had not complied with noise level directives.He says they carried out sound-proofing at the premises, which was approved by Nema and its report submitted to City Hall.
