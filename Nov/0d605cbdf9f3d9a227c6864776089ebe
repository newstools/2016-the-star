A court has temporarily stopped Kenya Power from extending chief executive Ben Chumo's tenure.The Labour and Employment Relations Court said Energy CS Charles Keter should not act on a letter for the Kenya Power board to consider Chumo for another term.Justice Nelson Abuodha issued the order on Thursday following an application by activist Okiya Omtatah.Omtatah said the extension of the chief executive's term would be irregular as the retirement age for public service workers is 60 years.Chumo, who was born on July 11, 1956, should have left office on that date this year.Abuodha directed the activist to serve the CS, AG and the Kenya Power advisory committee with the suit papers and return to court on December 3 for a hearing.Chumo and the public service commission are listed as interested parties in the suit.
