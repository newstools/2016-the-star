Nominated Senator Zipporah Kittony is shocked and disgusted by Machakos woman rep Susan Musyoka s language and is asking the government to fight corruption. Musyoka said at a media conference in Machakos town on Tuesday that President Uhuru Kenyatta should resign or commit suicide for not tackling corruption . The former Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation chairperson wondered why Musyoka could not moderate her language as a respected leader. I am not condoning corruption, but women should refrain from using inappropriate language, especially referring to the head of state, even if it is just out of respect to the office he holds, Kittony said. ***********During the last International Telecommunication Unions summit in Budapest, Hungary, last October, Kenya made a spectacle of itself that the rest of the world has not forgotten. While the government delegation had gone to campaign for compatriot Bishar Hussein to be re-elected director general, Kenyan civil society groups actively went to campaign against him. When the activists could not register as Kenyans, they convinced Norway to allow them to register as Norwegians to access the plenary hall. A group of foreigners was heard discussing why Kenyans pull each other down, yet such a position brings prestige to their motherland.************The likelihood of former Presidential candidate Peter Kenneth joining the Jubilee Part and possibly running in Nairobi for Governor has sent other aspirants back to the drawing board. After a union of four aspirants - Johnson Sakaja, Mike Sonko, Margaret Wanjiru and Dennis Waweru - failed to kick off, Jubilee strategists are wondering how Kenneth fits in the equation. The four politicians had announced they would work together and support whoever wins the nominations, but our moles tell us they are yet to be seen together due to mutual suspicion and paranoia. Though Kenneth is yet to announce whether he will vie in Nairobi, we are told the four politicians have been sending emissaries to each other to revive their union.************Are there accountability questions at the National Aids and STI Control Programme? Sources whisper to Corridors that some powerful forces are stopping internal auditors from scrutinising Nascop. The institution is under the Health ministry. Nascop has been receiving hundreds of millions in donor funding. The ministry is currently in the eye of a Sh3.2 billion storm triggered by an interim internal audit leaked to a media house. The state, in a multi-pronged strategy, has moved to discredit the report. However, the EACC has instituted a probe into top Health officials. Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu also wants a special audit by an independent external auditor.
