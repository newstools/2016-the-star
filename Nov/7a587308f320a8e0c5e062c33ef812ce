Disquiet is brewing at the Luhya Elders&rsquo; Forum over chairman Patrick Wangamati's comment that Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi is a "Jubilee mole".Mudavadi has been pushing for the formation of the National Super Alliance (NASA) or Muungano Maalum, bringing opposition leaders together to beat Jubilee in the August 8, 2017 polls.But Wangamati said on October 25 that he cannot be trusted to join Cord because &ldquo;he is being used by Jubilee party to cause divisions&rdquo;.A section of members of the elders' group told the Star in confidence that they were concerned about Wangamati's statement, which they said was issued without consultation.They said on Thursday that the comment by the Nominated MP could be misinterpreted as the group's position."The statement should be taken as personal and not that of the forum. We only state our position as a forum after thorough consultations," a source said.Another said: "Right now, we are concentrating on Luhya unity of purpose and the launch of Mulembe Investment Bank slated for later this year in Bungoma."The forum brings together 18 members representing the 18 Luhya sub-tribes. Wangamati asked Cord leaders to investigate Mudavadi thoroughly before allowing him to join forces with them."How can you join our house and start dictating to us that you want to be the Cord presidential candidate? That is outrageous and beats logic. If you want to join us, wait for direction,&rdquo; he said in Bungoma.Mudavadi&rsquo;s spokesman Kibisu Kabatesi dismissed the remarks saying Wangamati was "an impediment to a Luhya presidency".He said the mole comment was meant to divert attention from tribulations facing Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. Wangamati is Ford Kenya Nominated MP.Multiple sources said the elders feel Wangamati was trying to use the forum to advance a Ford-K agenda instead of pushing for the Luhya community's community.Read: Mudavadi spokesman tells off MP Wangamati over 'Jubilee mole' claims
