He said the transfer should be done urgently for him to apply for Muthoni&rsquo;s bond. The case will be mentioned in Kiambu tomorrow.Waweru quashed an application for a lawyer representing the county head teachers&rsquo; association to be enjoined, saying that is not applicable in a criminal case.Muthoni was arrested on November 13 in her Ichachiri Secondary School home in Gatundu, Kiambu, where she has been principal. Her arrest was after Mwangi&rsquo;s body was found in a coffee plantation. Police said the body was badly mutilated, with some teeth missing and the hands tied behind his back.
