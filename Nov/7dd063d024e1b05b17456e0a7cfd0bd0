A couple split acrimoniously after a man named Banana threw a plant pot at his girlfriend called Orange, a court heard.Magistrates heard care worker Themba Banana, 29, had been in a volatile long-term relationship with Sarah Orange at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire.Blackburn Magistrates' Court was told a furious row erupted early one morning last August when she caught him whispering on the phone - and feared he had a secret lover.Police were called and initially persuaded Banana to leave the house to calm the situation - but he returned hours later and the couple argued again, ending with Banana throwing the pot into Miss Orange's midriff. Their relationship is now over and Banana was slapped with a community order and given 100 hours unpaid work after admitting assault.Prosecutor Catherine Allen told magistrates how the care worker had been drinking wine prior to the incident with Miss Orange at their former home.Miss Allan explained how Miss Orange told police how Banana had "hit her" previously but he "got as good as he gave".On the day of the offence he had returned from a night shift.Miss Allan said: "An argument started because he was whispering on the phone and she thought he was talking to another woman."The police were called and told him to leave and sober up."While Miss Orange was on the phone, Banana was heard to make "obscene, racist comments", the court was told.Banana, now of Preston, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to assaulting Sarah Orange and causing an offensive message to be sent by means of a public communications network.He was given a community order with 25 days rehabilitation activity requirement and 100 hours unpaid work. Banana was also ordered to pay 175 compensation, 85 victim surcharge and 85 costs.Aftab Bakhat, defending, said Banana had called the police first and had left the house when they asked him to."The wine he had drunk affected him because he hadn't slept since finishing work," said Mr Bakhat."He will potentially lose his job as a result of this conviction."
