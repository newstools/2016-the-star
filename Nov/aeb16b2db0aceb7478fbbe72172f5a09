The Maasai should support the Jubilee government because it has started many projects to help the community, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has said.&ldquo;Since Independence, we have never seen a government like this, doing several projects for us, and we have every reason to fully back Jubilee,&rdquo; he said.Nkaissery spoke on Sunday during a fundraiser for the Presbyterian Outreach Mission Church in Limanet, Narok county. Nairobi speaker Alex Magelo was present. Nkaissery said there are Maasais holding high government including, including a CS, PSs and members of boards. He said this is a sign the government has the community&rsquo;s interests at heart. He urged the community to remain united and maintain peace in the run-up to the election.Nkaissery urged residents to be patient as the government repairs the Narok-Sekanani and Narok-Nakuru roads. He said only Jubilee can solve the Mau Forest issue and urged the residents to stop politicising the problem.Nkaissery said Narok is a Jubilee zone. &ldquo;This time the opposition has no place in Narok. We will ensure Jubilee sweeps all the seats,&rdquo; he said. Nkaissery said Cord co-principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka &ldquo;have done nothing&rdquo; for Kenyans despite being in the government for a long time.On graft, Nkaissery hit out at the judiciary for failing to address it effectively. He said the government works hard to arrest corruption suspects but the courts don&rsquo;t sentence them.&ldquo;We arrest criminals, corruption suspects and those who have wronged Kenyans, but the judiciary releases them on bond. We should have a situation where the law prevails rather promoting individualism,&rdquo; Nkaissery said.He urged Chief Justice David Maraga to overhaul the judiciary. &ldquo;Parliament should also work on a law to establish a tribunal that looks critically at how the judiciary works,&rdquo; Nkaissery said.He told the opposition to stop &ldquo;tarnishing&rdquo; the government&rsquo;s image by mentioning state officials &ldquo;in every corruption scandal&rdquo;.Nkaissery said it is the responsibility of every individual &ndash; not just the government &ndash; to fight graft.He lashed out at the Mombasa High Court for ordering his arrest and prosecution over the destruction of a yacht used to traffick heroin worth more than Sh20 million. Nkaissery said the government had issued an order that ships, aircraft and vehicles found with narcotics be destroyed. &ldquo;And that is what we did. I do know where the magistrate is coming from because you cannot stop the government from undertaking its duties,&rdquo; he said. Especially when it comes to security matter,&rdquo; Nkaissery said.
