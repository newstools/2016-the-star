The officer in charge of the Kenya Anti-Narcotics Unit, Hamisi Masa, told a Kibera court yesterday they were acting on intelligence reports when they seized the container that contained 99kg of cocaine worth more than Sh500,000. He was testifying in a case in which Briton Jack Wolf has been charged alongside Francis Mwanthi with jointly trafficking the cocaine. The court heard that after Masa got the intelligence reports, he sent his officers to the Mombasa port. After they seized the container, he personally went to Mombasa and saw the drugs. Masa told the court he travelled to the Cast on July 29 with government analyst Dennis Onyango and he was shown seven bags with the cocaine. The bags had been marked and had 90 slabs, each weighing 1.1kg.
