Two routes cutting through National Park have been identified as the best options for the Standard Gauge Railway Phase II A.This is contained in an interim report that was to be presented for public scrutiny from 9am to 12pm on Thursday, at the World Wildlife Fund offices in Nairobi.John Kiringe, a professor in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) study for the proposed project, has also listed options outside the park. But these were listed as the "worst options".Read: Conservationists protest SGR's Nairobi National Park routeThe ESIA released late October notes routes named option 3 and 4 will run on embankment, straight on in a northeast direction for approximately two Kilometres outside the NNP.From this point, the proposal is that it takes a bend in the south western direction and enter the NNP near the East Gate.The route, considered the best, then crosses over the park through the savannah region along a 6km viaduct (flyover).In the proposal, the SGR will exit the park near the NNP s Maasai Gate SGR near Tuala area, from where it will turn west past Tuala market centre.The line will then proceed to Ongata Rongai town then cross Magadi Road through the Adventist University of Africa.The SGR line will then proceed through Nkoroi area and cross Ngong Road at Ebulbul town before heading to a tunnel near Ebulbul in Ngong. The consultants says the approximate construction cost for option 3 and 4, a distance of about 36 km, will be Sh 53 billion and Sh55 billion respectively.What have been touted as "worst option 7" and option (1) will cost Sh84 billion and Sh67 billion respectively.Option (1) avoids the park running from Nairobi South Station-Langata-Kibera-Dagoretti-to the Ngong tunnel. Option (7) runs from Nairobi South Station-Arthi River-Rongai to Ngong tunnel.The estimated cost of the project (Nairobi-Naivasha) is Sh156, 518,120,483, excluding land acquisition aqnd demolitions costs, duties, loan financing and other such expenses.Read: Nairobi-Naivasha SGR construction to cost Sh2 billion moreBut the report says: "In view of the findings of the ESIA, the proposed project is considered as environmentally sound." It further recommends that SGR Phase 2 construction be approved based on route option 4."This needs willingness by the proponent to implement the project in strict adherence to the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Environmental Monitoring Plan," the report says."Further, Nema should issue the proponent with an EIA license as required by Kenya s environmental laws."Kiringe said the 6km corridor will not have highly significant adverse environmental impacts because the railway will cross through a well-designed flyover."The flyover will be fitted with a sufficient underpass for wildlife movement in the park," he said.Public approval is being sought amid pressure for alternative routes that will not put the environment and animals at risk. This is the desire of many Kenyans, conservationists in particular.The government's push for the railway line to cut through the park is said to have dented Kenya's global image in environmental conservation.Conservationists have argued that the line will disrupt the park's ecosystem, leading to its slow death.But the report argues that lines have been built through parks in other countries, without having adverse impacts.Nairobi National Park collects more than Sh30 million in gate fees but the ecological worth of the park has not been quantified.
