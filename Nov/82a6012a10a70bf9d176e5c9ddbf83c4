Athletes under Rosa Associati management have expressed their joy after the Director of Public Prosecution withdrew a doping case against the Italian athletics agent Federico Rosa.Federico had denied six counts of charges related to doping and ruining the reputations of two Kenyan athletes Elijah Kiprono and Ritah Jeptoo by administering prohibited substances. Three-time world 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop said the allegations had affected the general performance of athletes from the camp. We always believe in the truth and we all along knew he was innocent. However, this whole episode has affected us psychologically, He said. It has been a hard time especially for me trying to tell the world the true position over the allegations. But all in all, we knew the truth will one day prevail and we will always live for the truth, he explained. Asbel represented Kenya in the Rio Olympics but failed to sparkle amid murmurs that his poor show was due to the psychological torture he underwent after his manager was arrested and charged. Former world 800m champion Alfred Kirwa Yego said it has not been business as usual in camp since the claims emerged and he is happy rthe truth finally prevailed.
