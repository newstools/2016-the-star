The battle for Suba MP seat is shaping into a two-horse race between close allies of CORD leader Raila Odinga.ODM chairman John Mbadi is facing stiff competition from Caroli Omondi - a former Raila aide. Speaking to the Star on phone, Caroli said his loyalty to ODM party is unwavering and should be rewarded with the party ticket."I have never played allegiance to a different political party apart from ODM. This time round, it is my chance to win the seat," Caroli said.Referring to Homa Bay senator by-election in February 2015, Caroli said he never ditched the ODM despite Senator Moses Kajwang being given the ticket."As opposed to other candidates who opted for other parties, I remained steadfast in ODM even though the nomination was not credible," he said.Caroli said he has identified a number of meaningful projects which he will initiate to help the constituents once elected in 2017."Suba residents are faced with acute shortage of water and bad roads which I will fix once in office," he said, "The worst part is that Suba has not had any tarmacked road since independence," The aspirant faulted the incumbent Mbadi of doing little to change living standards of his constituents."There are no tangible projects the current leadership can proudly point as among its achievements," Caroli said.For his part, Mbadi said that his development track record speaks of itself and will earn him a third term."The question whether I will defeat Caroli is unnecessary. What I should be asked is by what margin will I triumph my opponent," Mbadi said.The Suba MP said Caroli's candidature is not new to him, noting that he has been defeating him in the past contests.Mbadi added that the forthcoming elections will be a repeat of the past outcomes."I am talking while knowing that elections will be free and fair to all contenders. There will be no favour at all hence there should be nobody should panic about nomination process. I will support them if they defeat me," Mbadi said.Suba constituency has four wards(Suba South, Suba North, Kaksingri and Ruma) with 32,440 registered voters, according to data from the IEBC before the 2013 general election.
