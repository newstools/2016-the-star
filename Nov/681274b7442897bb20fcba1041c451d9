Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world, is not on the verge of death, experts said on Friday.Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ally-Said Matano however admitted that lake is faced with serious threats including increased pollution, declining fish stock and invasion by hyacinth weed."The lake is facing threats but we have put in place measures to address them. East African Community members states are also working on programs aimed at reducing the stress on the lake. The lake can only die when we don t have water," he said.Matano spoke at Kisumu's Tom Mboya Labour College ahead of Saturday's Lake Victoria Basin Commission s 10 year anniversary celebrations.The celebrations will be held at Jalaram Academy in Kisumu. The guiding theme for the celebrations is: "10 Years of Sustainable Development Through Partnerships."He was accompanied by Kenya s Water CS Eugene Wamalwa, Tanzania s Water and Irrigation PS Mbogo Futakamba, EAC deputy executive secretary Christophe Bazivamo and several EALA MPs.Hundreds of tonnes of raw sewage and industrial waste flow into the lake annually while the noxious hyacinth weed which invaded the lake more than 20 years ago has choked part of the lake disrupting transport and fishing."On water hyacinth, we have tried several methods including harvesting and introduction of weevils. There is a time we addressed the problem by 80 per cent so all is not lost as countries have measures to handle it," added Matano.Matano said they will use the 10 years anniversary to take stock of achievements, lesson learnt and challenges towards conservation of the Lake Victoria Basin.Read: Kisumu to use Sh270m to clean Lake Victoria, fund research Wamalwa and Futakamba praised the commission saying it has achieved a lot for the past 10 years in sustainably managing the Lake Victoria Basin. "As a riparian country, we are proud of LVBC and what they have done. It is not easy to have an holistic approach in managing a basin but LVBC has done a tremendous job," said Futakamba.Wamalwa said despite efforts by EAC member states in addressing the challenges facing the lake, the same are yet to be fully surmounted.Some of the challenges he said include poor water quality and quantity, pollution, fluctuating levels of water and declining fisheries resources.EALA MP Nancy Abisai decried increased pollution in the lake and depletion of fish stocks."The millions of people who depend on the lake for livelihoods are in danger unless we take measures to save this resource," she said.LVBC is an institution of the East African Community whose mission is to promote, facilitate and coordinate activities of different actors towards sustainable development and poverty eradication of the Lake Victoria Basin.Read: Talks on Lake Victoria security project
