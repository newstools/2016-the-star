IG Joseph Boinnet on Wednesday ordered police to impound all Probox vehicles found operating without PSV licences.This is after complaints by matatu owners that the number of Probox vehicles operating as PSVs is increasing, which is hurting their genuine businesses."They cause accidents. Kenyans die and others are maimed but they cannot be compensated because these vehicles do not have PSV insurance," Boinnet said.More on this: Probox and Wish cars out of public transportHe was speaking at the Matatu Owners Association delegates conference at KICC.MOA chairman Simon Kimutai said the vehicles do not have PSV stickers, insurance and speed governors but have been allocated picking and dropping points by county governments.Read: NTSA blames cops for misbehaving Probox driversPresident Uhuru Kenyatta asked matatu owners to rein in on rogue crew to bring order and sanity to the sector.In a speech read by Transport CS James Macharia, Uhuru told matatu saccos to instil discipline among their crew and treat passengers with dignity.He said most Kenyans prefer private vehicles because of the rogue nature of the PSV operators, indiscipline and dirty vehicles.The president urged the PSV owners to consider investing in high capacity buses, especially in major towns to reduce traffic jam. If you introduce the high capacity vehicles and train your drivers to drive carefully, ensure the vehicles are clean and are courteous to the passengers, then most people will leave their cars at home and use public transport. This will reduce traffic tremendously."Also read: Avoid matatus whose crew is not in uniform, police advise commutersBoinnet and EACC deputy CEO Michael Mubea urged the operators to stop giving bribes to traffic police officers. It takes two to tango, so when you give [bribe] you are also committing and offense and you should be arrested alongside the officer, Boinnet said.On Tuesday, Kimutai said the sector loses Sh3 billion annually to corrupt traffic police officers.He said drivers who do not give a bribe face trumped-up charges, which will force them to part with more money if they are taken to court. What is happening on our roads is not a case of willing-buyer, willing-seller, but extortion by police officers, it is no longer a bribe, Kimutai said.
