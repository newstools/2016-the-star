Clerics in Naivasha have expressed alarm at what they suspect are ritual and withcraft killings and abductions.They called for investigation and punishment of criminals involved in crimes against women and children. They also want deportation of traditional healers tback to Uganda and Tanzania.They cited the recent case on Karagita Estate where two minors were murdered and mutilated. They said many minors are missing.After the children were murdered, Karagita residents last week raided several houses belonging to suspected witchdoctors and collected paraphernalia.Nakuru county prayer coordinator Bishop John Maina demanded action. Maina said Naivasha is peaceful but recent killings are giving it a bad name and reversing gains made in boosting the town as a tourist destination. &ldquo;Most of these traditional healers come from neighbouring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania and they should be deported because they are here illegally,&rdquo; he said.
