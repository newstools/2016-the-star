Former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey has publicly declared he will run for the Nandi governor ‘s job. The incumbent is Governor Cleophas Lagat. Speaking at Kobujoi Catholic Church on Sunday, Kosgey said he will transform the county and “liberate it from corruption which has undermined devolution in the region.” “I am responding to calls from the people. I am ready to take up the challenge and battle it out with the other aspirants next year,” he said. Kosgey said he will seek the Jubilee Party ticket, setting off a tough contest with Lagat and 11 other hopefuls. Most of the 11 are close allies of Deputy President William Ruto who says he doesn’t have a preferred candidate. Some of the aspirants are considering vying as independents or on other parties’ tickets, due to the stiff competition for the Jubile Party tickets, and fear that the nominations won’t be free and fair. The other aspirants are Nandi Senator Stephen Sang, former Agriculture CS Felix Koskei, Silas Kipruto, Alphonse Misoi, Daniel Koech, Tirop Koech, Barnabas Sang, Anderson Serem, Kiprotich Cherarge and Peter Maiyo.
