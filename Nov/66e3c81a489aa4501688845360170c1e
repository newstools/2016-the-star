Lamu East MP Shariff Athman has defended Jubilee against claims that the Sh38 billion equipment leased to counties has not benefited residents.He said through the medical equipment scheme, Lamu has for the first time received dialysis machines, an ICU, CT scans and modern X-ray machines.This was in response to questions raised by Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi, while on a tour of the region, on whether the equipment's impact has been felt.Mudavadi said at the weekend that counties were not only coerced to sign for the equipment in 2014, but are yet to solve medical needs of county residents.In a statement to the media on Monday, Athman said Lamu has benefit a great deal from the issued equipment, "the first since independence 54 years ago".He said the county received Sh1.2 billion for procurement of the said medical equipment and construction of health to house the same."For the first time the King Fahad hospital will have a dialysis, ICU, CT scans and modern X-ray machines. The same for the Faza and Mpeketoni sub-district hospitals," said Shariff.Read: Medical equipment transforming counties Also read: We re fulfilling promises we made, says UhuruThe MP, who recently decamped from UDF to Jubilee, said it is through the Uhuru Kenyatta administration that Lamu has been considered in such an exercise. He accused Mudavadi of not pushing for development in the region despite his party winning governor and MP seat in the 2013 general election."Lamu never received any development through his leadership or influence as the party patron," Athman told Mudavadi, terming the latter;'s assertions as skewed and ill-timed.Mudavadi, through his press secretary Kibisu Kabatesi, said the MP had missed out on the logic behind Mudavadi s statement.He said the matter was not on whether the leased equipment had been allocated or not, pointing out that Governor Issa Timamy had confirmed that he was yet to receive the equipment. Kabatesi said the MP was on a personal mission of clarifying matters that he (Athman) cannot comprehend."Mudavadi simply wants an audit of the equipment procurement contracts that could cost taxpayers Sh35 billion in the event they are not delivered," Kabatesi said.He said there were fears that the equipment may be unistalled, lack trained personnel to run them and be bought at an inflated price under skewed tendering schemes."Only a forensic audit will save the country from the looming loss of funds under the scheme. Why did the government headhunt specific local companies as agents and sole suppliers," Kabatesi said.He dismissed Athman as having no idea what auditing is.
