Ford Kenya is headed for a major internal clash and split as a renegade faction seeks to remove party leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula for unilaterally anointing himself presidential flagbearer.They rebels say he has not called a major party meeting for three years.Wetang&rsquo;ula has called a National Governing Council meeting on November 26 at the Bomas of Kenya to confirm his candidacy for President.Mutineers have called parallel meeting in Thika on the same day and plan to name Trans Nzoia Senate aspirant Ken Wafula as party leader. It has drawn up a list of officials.National organising secretary Peter Munyae yesterday said more than 350 delegates will attend the Thika meeting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve finalised plans. Members who want to salvage the party have raised funds so it succeeds,&rdquo; he said.Deputy party leader Boni Khalwale has dismissed the plan as illegal and a violation of the party&rsquo;s constitution. He said only secretary general Eseli Simiyu and party leader have powers to convene such meetings. &ldquo;Strangers have no such mandate. Such a plan is irrelevant,&rdquo; Khalwale said.The rebel faction is accused of being sponsored by outsiders to wreck the party from within. It has emerged that a list of 51 new officials to be elected and endorsed in Thika is circulating.In addition to Wafula as leader, it lists Munyae as secretary general, Gabriel Hanjari from Kilifi as first deputy party leader and Engineer Julius Nyarotso as second deputy party leader.Siaya&rsquo;s Andrew Aduda has been proposed for chairman, Kisii&rsquo;s Raphael Raini for treasurer, Machakos&rsquo; Josephine Maungu for vice chairman in charge of women&rsquo;s affairs and Garissa&rsquo;s Khatra Sigat for vice chairman in charge of youth affairs.The Wafula-led renegades accuse Wetang&rsquo;ula of violating the party constitution by failing to convene meetings for more than three years. They say he made himself party&rsquo;s flagbearer without following procedures.
