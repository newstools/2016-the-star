The Easy Coach bus management is counting on its drivers training programme to improve its road safety record and operations in the country. The management halted operations of more than 200 buses on November 24, to educate its drivers on road safety and good relations with clients. The management said the training was necessitated by the accident that occurred in October at Sachangwan along Nakuru Eldoret road, which claimed six lives. Grounding of buses means enormous loss of revenues, but it is nothing compared to the knowledge imparted as well as the lives that are lost daily on our roads due to human error, managing director Azim Dossa said.
