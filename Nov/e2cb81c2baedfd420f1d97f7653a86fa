Global hotel chain Sheraton is targeting to a bigger share of Nairobi s growing meetings, incentives, conferences and events segment of the tourism industry, its top official has said. The hotel, which runs Sheraton Kampala, Djibouti and Addis Ababa, has embarked on an aggressive campaign targeted at corporate entities. Sheraton Kampala general manager Jean Philippe said Nairobi remains a key entry point to the six-nation East African Community bloc, making it the best hub for tapping travellers and investors into the region. Kenya is our number one market with about 30 per cent of our customers coming from here. We are investing in Kenya to continue building a strong relationship and to develop new markets, Philippe told the Star in an interview. He said its Kampala facility is also counting on the high numbers of Kenyans who flock Uganda for business. The hotel hosted the Kenyan corporate and business community for a cocktail in Nairobi last week. Philippe said the event was to appreciate the strong support the hotel has received from Nairobi.
