NYS suspect Josephine Kabura has admitted giving her "friend", suspended KCB driver John Kago, Sh60 million in cash without security.Kago was linked to the Sh791 million NYS scandal, in which Kabura is a key suspect, after Sh346 million was wired to his accounts.He is said to have received the money from Kabura and Nairobi businessman Ben Gethi, who is also a key suspect in the scam."I know him and even gave him a loan of Sh60m which he was to refund and he did," Kabura told the National Assembly PAC on Tuesday."We were good friends and maybe the business he was doing needed more money. So after discussion I loaned him the money."Read: Bank driver at pains to explain Sh346 million payment from NYS suspectsKabura said they signed a document on their agreement, which entailed a payback plus 10 per cent interest, and have not engaged in any other deals since.But pressed on how much she earned as interest, the businesswoman could not provide a figure, forcing remarks by chairman Nicholas Gumbo, who threatened to declare her a hostile witness.The committee also learned that Kabura made a withdrawal of Sh52 million from a bank.Asked where she took the money, the businesswoman said she used it to pay contractors at a quarry site in Rongai."All the cash withdrawn was to pay for materials delivered to the site...I used to withdraw the cash because the grassroots people were paid in cash," she said."Since the exercise was being done day and night I had to have cash."Kabura could not explain how she carried the money without security and did not have receipts for the payments she claimed she made."I did not have any security arrangement. The money was carried in three bags and transported one bag after the other," she said.Annoyed by her response, the PAC tasked her with telling the truth, failure of which the questioning would be stopped.But Kabura took a few minutes to answer some of the questions raised and tried dodging others.The suspect earlier told the Public Accounts Committee that she owns 20 companies but had only registered five by the time she started working with the NYS.More on this: Kabura tells PAC she owns, solely runs 20 companies in NYS probeAlso read: Barclays, Equity among banks to be probed in Sh800 million NYS scandal
