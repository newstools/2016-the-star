ODM wants the Office of the Deputy President investigated over the NYS scandal. ODM national chairman John Mbadi and Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said there is suspicion that somebody in DP William Ruto s office wass involved in loss of the money.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Mbadi said the manner in which Ruto is engaging in public spats with former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru indicate some of the DP s office holders might also involved. Ruto has been quiet before Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Farouk Kibet were mentioned in the scandal, he said.Mbadi told National Assembly Public Accounts Committee chairman Nicholas Gumbo to ensure Ruto s office is investigated over the NYS scandal. This scandal is bigger than Waiguru alone and anybody who demonstrates suspicion should be investigated effectively, because it is evident Kenyans lost extremely large amount of money in the NYSscandal, he said.Mbadi urged Ruto to apologise to Cord leader Raila Odinga for differing with him when Raila first spoke about the lost National Youth Service money. Ruto should now apologise to Raila for accusing him of walking up and down with false corruption claims, yet he is the one who was on the wrong side, he said.Kaluma said Ruto s exchange with Waiguru demonstrated that Jubilee is not ready to fight corruption. We need a government that can fight corruption, he said.Kaluma urged Kenyans to vote out the Jubilee administration next year. Why should Kenyans give Jubilee a second term after all these economic mess and sabotage, he said.
