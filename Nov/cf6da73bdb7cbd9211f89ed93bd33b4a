Youth Enterprise Fund chairman Ronald Osumba yesterday criticised the poor repayment of loans given to youth in Meru county.He said only 50 per cent of the funds borrowed since the YEF s inception have been repaid. Osumba spoke in Meru town. He said the fund has issued loans worth Sh11.7 billion. Youth in Mandera, Lamu and Turkana have had problems accessing the loans because the Fund offices are far from them, Osumba said. We want to uplift the youth and women economically. Meru is the fourth in applying for the money but they are repaying poorly, he said.Osumba urged the Meru youth to repay the loans for others to access the money.Public Service, Gender and Youth CS Sicilly Kariuki was also in Meru at the weekend. She urged parents to teach their children the importane of taking and repaying loans. The CS said it will promote community prosperity.
