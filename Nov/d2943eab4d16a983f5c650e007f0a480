Wiper chairman David Musila has said he is a senior politician who should not be engaged, insulted and criticised by low-ranking MCAs. He has declared his interest in becoming Kitui governor. I am not playing in the same league with MCAs. I am not in competition with any MCA because I am not running for an MCA position. I am taking a shot at the Kitui governorship, which is a more senior position than that of MCA, the Kitui senator said.Musila presided over a fundraiser for 138 students at Musukini market in Mwingi Central subcounty on Saturday. He said it is amoral for low-level politicians to criticise and insult a senior politician such as himself. Your MCA has no right to hurl insults at me because I am not competing for his seat. I am running for governor. I want you to caution your MCA [Bernard] Sila against his wayward behaviour, Musila told residents.

Musila called for respect during campaigns. He urged all aspirants to uphold peaceful campaigns devoid of violence and vitriol. Musila said inciters risk being denied the Wiper ticket.He criticised his opponents for harping on about his age, saying it is a non-issue. Is age really a crime?
