Cord wants to be enjoined to the government's defamation complaint against Nation Media Group concerning allegations that health officials stole Sh5.3 billion. The opposition, in what appears to be a new onslaught against the state, accused the Jubilee administration of breeding graft.In a terse letter to Media Council chairman Charles Kerich, the coalition led by Raila Odinga said it would like to participate in the proceedings as an interested party.ICT CS Joe Mucheru lodged a complaint against NMG with the Media Council of Kenya on Wednesday. The CS protested what he termed the depiction of the government as "corrupt, inept and made up of thieves"."Business Daily and NTV must be compelled to show where, in the interim report, it is stated that Health ministry officials stole more than Sh5.3 billion...We hope they will table any proof they have," said Mucheru.He further singled out NTV for a series of broadcasts dubbed 'System ya Majambazi' (system of thugs).Read: Nation Media company received Mafia House cash, CS Mucheru says in letter to Media CouncilBut Cord secretariat boss Norman Magaya said on Thursday that President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration had no reputation to be defamed."This is a government that has embalmed corruption as part of its DNA and celebrates the corrupt in its ranks," the lawyer said."The government is a property belonging to all Kenyans and no single individual can arrogate himself the monopoly of purporting to feel infringed and raise a claim to defamation."He added that Mucheru's complaint was anchored on the mistaken view that the government is a sanctuary that should not be scrutinised and asked for accountability.The coalition further said the government was not a private entity and that it was only out to gag the media in a 'thinly veiled attack on press freedom".Magaya said the complaint was raised to hit back at the media house for exposing the dirty deals of "wala nyama (meat eaters)"."Our position is that the Jubilee coalition has conceived, bred and nurtured corruption as one of its key performance indicators," he said."In the unlikely event that the complaints commission decides to set this matter down for a hearing, we wish to inform you that we will come on record as interested parties."Magaya added that Cord's participation of Cord will be with a "view to helping the council arrive at an informed decision".Read: Nation Media denies owning firm linked to Sh5.3 billion Mafya House scam
