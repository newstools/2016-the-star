Murang a county will benefit from an extra Sh500 million from the national government as compensation for the Northern Water Collector Tunnel.Deputy President William Ruto said the money will be used to enhance water connectivity in the county and expand its distribution to homes.He spoke on Saturday in Maragua town as he inspected development projects.The DP said the Jubilee administration is committed to improving Kenyans livelihoods.He slammed opposition leader Raila Odinga for politicising the tunnel. Raila wanted the people of Murang a to get angry with the government and withdraw their support, Ruto said.He was responding to calls by local leaders to enhance water connection in Maragua subcounty, where residents rely on boreholes.Governor Mwangi Wairia said the biggest challenge for the county is water distribution.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has agreed to allocate funds to procurement of pipes to distribute already harnessed water to homes, he said.Athi Water Services Board, which is constructing the 11.8km tunnel meant to draw water from rivers Gikigie, Maragua and Mathioya, has initiated water projects worth Sh4.4 billion in the county as compensation.The tunnel is funded by the World Bank at a cost of Sh6.8 billion and will convey 142,000 cubic metres of water into Ndakaini Dam every day for use in Nairobi county.Last month, Wamalwa said the government has set aside Sh290 million for the Gatanga irrigation project, Sh220 million for Gatango irrigation project and Sh1.2 billion for Ithanga irrigation project.A further Sh50 million, he said, has been set aside to establish a water master plan for Murang a county that will be done in partnership with the county government.Athi Water Services Board has also advertised for a consultant to carry out a feasibility study for the construction of the multi-purpose Maragua Dam that will improve water provision in both Murang a and Nairobi counties.The dam will also provide water for irrigation.
