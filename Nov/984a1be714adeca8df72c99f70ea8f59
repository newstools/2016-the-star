Kitutu Chache South MP aspirant Anthony Kibagendi has told ODM to be wary of returnees. He said the return of Bomachoge Chache MP Simon Ogari and his Kitutu Chache South counterpart Richard Onyonka to ODM after flirting with the Jubilee Party is suspect. Their return should be treated cautiously. Someone like Onyonka is a pretender. He will go back to his old ways after achieving his achievements in ODM, Kibagendi said.Ogari and Onyonka apologised to party leader Raila Odinga on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya during ODM s National Governing Council.
