He said the return of Bomachoge Chache MP Simon Ogari and his Kitutu Chache South counterpart Richard Onyonka to ODM after flirting with the Jubilee Party is suspect.&ldquo;Their return should be treated cautiously. Someone like Onyonka is a pretender. He will go back to his old ways after achieving his achievements in ODM,&rdquo; Kibagendi said.Ogari and Onyonka apologised to party leader Raila Odinga on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya during ODM&rsquo;s National Governing Council.
