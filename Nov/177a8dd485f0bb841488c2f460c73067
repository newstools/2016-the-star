Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru should be arrested and prosecuted over the NYS scandal, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said.Murkomen, who has denied receiving any cash from the service, said there was evidence that Waiguru was behind irregular payments.He said evidence that suspect Josephine Kabura gave the Public Accounts Committee was enough to sustain charges against Waiguru.Murkomen told the EACC and the DCI to charge former Cabinet Secretary or "corruption could as well be legalised in the country".Waiguru adversely mentioned Murkomen and Deputy President William Ruto s aide Farouk Kibet when she was grilled by the PAC.Read: Waiguru links Duale, Farouk, Murkomen to NYSBut the Senator said: Those who carried money in sacks should carry their own crosses. I want to tell Waiguru that 'NYS is your own cross'. I will not carry it for you. The only thing I can do is represent you in court."It had been reported that the National Youth Service lost Sh791 million through IFMIS transactions but a report by Auditor General Edward Ouko raised the amount to Sh1.6 billion.Kabura admitted when she was grilled that she gave her "friend", suspended KCB driver John Kago, Sh60 million in cash without security.More on this: 'Hostile' Josephine Kabura admits giving Kago Sh60m without securityAlso read: Murkomen denies NYS hired his law firm, says Waiguru affidavit a diversionary tacticIn his first public response after being linked to the scandal, Murkomen said his law firm did not receive money from another suspect, businessman Ben Gethi.But he confirmed that Gethi, who was accused of irregularly receiving money from NYS, was his client.In his address on Friday, he challenged Waiguru to produce evidence that he received money from the youths agency or suspects linked to graft in the service. When I was a Sunday school teacher, I never stole a single cent of offerings. How can I then steal public money? he asked during the launch of a NYS youth empowerment project in Kolowa Bridge at the border of Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties I am ready to face anyone with evidence that our law firm received even a single cent from NYS thieves. The onslaught began when Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said linking Murkomen and Kibet to the NYS scandal was part of a scheme to tarnish Ruto s image.Sang urged relevant state agencies to prosecute the culprits in the scandal.Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki, Mogotio MP Hellen Sambili and her Marakwet East Counterpart Bowen Kangogo said suspects in the NYS fraud should be arrested and prosecuted immediately.They urged the EACC to expedite investigations and punish those found guilty to restore the agency's lost glory.Kariuki, who presided over the event, assured Murkomen that no money will be stolen from the service. We will do anything possible to ensure money is not misappropriated, she said."As a mother and true citizen of this nation, I am offended on behalf of more than 2,000 jobless youths who could have been employed."Kariuki said operations were stalled after the allegations but noted that more than 70,000 youths across 74 constituencies have been trained and saved a total of Sh1.4 billion.Kangogo said: "As a member of the Public Service Committee int he National Assembly, I assure Kenyans that the culprits shall soon be thrown into police cells and charged with graft in court."Nine hundred youths from Mogotio, 800 from Marakwet East and 700 from Baringo south were contracted to work on new road, water and school projects by the NYS.Read: Arrest Waiguru, all other NYS theft suspects, Ababu tells UhuruAlso read: PAC call for more witnesses to delay Sh1.6 billion NYS theft report
