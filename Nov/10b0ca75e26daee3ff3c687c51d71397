Under the Access to Information Act 2016, leaders and managers wealth declarations and Kenya Revenue Authority records should be in the public domain in each and every case where a Kenyan has used them to enter public office.But this information is releasable only to individuals. A member of the public has to follow an elaborate application process and the details are released only to him or her. A non-media savvy inquirer who also happens not to be interested in the big picture might be given bombshell documents of the keenest public interest concerning a VIP that might lie undiscovered for years. The political system will never function properly until graft is eradicated. Spotting a leader s quantum leap from penury to millionaire status in one election cycle, or a manager s in a year or less, is now possible with the Access to Information Act. For a start, the EACC and KRA should furnish activist Boniface Mwangi with Deputy President William Ruto s full wealth declaration and taxation records.
