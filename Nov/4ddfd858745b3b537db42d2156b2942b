Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel slapped me and kicked me in the stomach at the office of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery over a meeting with the CS, nominated MP Sarah Lekorere has said.Lekorere told journalists at the Nairobi Women s Hospital, Hurlingham, that she led a delegation of MCAs and elders from the constituency yesterday for a meeting with Nkaissery on insecurity issues.They had appealed to Nkaissery to continue disarming herders in Laikipia county, a move Lempurkel is said be opposed to.The disarmament has stalled, amid claims that some Samburu leaders influenced the decision to stop it. Laikipia residents have complained that Samburu herders looking for pasture and water for their animals attack them.Lekorere supports the disarmament of the pastoralists, as ordered by the Cabinet in October. However, Lempurkel says the police are abusing the pastoralists human rights and has been pushing Nkaissery to go slow on the disarmament.Lekorere said that after Nkaissery left, she remained behind with her group on the sixth floor of Harambee House and hardly 10 minutes had elapsed when Lempurkel walked in, demanding to know what the meeting was about.She said after a brief engagement, the MP slapped me and kicked me in the stomach, hurling insults at me. Lekorere said her life is in danger and the situation became worse when she declared she will run for Laikipia North MP, the position held by Lempurkel. It is not the first time he is attacking me and insulting me, calling me a whore. I have written to the Inspector General of Police [Joseph Boinnet] over the matter, but nothing has been done, she said.The nominated legislator recorded a statement at the Parliament police station before going to the hospital for a scan.By press time, she was waiting to undergo a stomach scan.Lempurkel refused to address journalists after recording his statement at the station.He also did not answer the Star s phone calls for comment.
