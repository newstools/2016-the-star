Newly promoted National Super League outfit Isibania FC s participation in the second tier league is threatened owing to financial constraints.Team manager, David Chacha, yesterday said the team does not have a sponsor and appealed for help. We have approached corporates and the Migori County Government and we are waiting for their response. For the last three years, we have been running the team from our pockets and well wishers, said Chacha. He also expressed his worries over the poor state of the Kenya Revenue Authority s grounds in Isibania. The stadium doesn t meet the required standards to host National Super League matches but we have written to the county government to help, added Chacha.Chacha further said they would be forced to play their home matches at Sony Green Stadium in Awendo which is an added cost to the team.The team manager was upbeat that if they get financial support, the team will qualify to the SportPesa Premier League in 2018. We have been rising gradually for the last three years and our target is to play in the top tier league in 2018, he further added.He said the team mainly consists of school boys, eight of whom are students at Chebiusi Secondary with the rest drawn from Kodero Bara and Kakamega High.Chacha said the players have taken a break until January 9; adding they will sign five experienced players to beef up the team. He paid tribute to coach Dan Musa and his assistant Fred Kibe for steering the team to the NSL.
