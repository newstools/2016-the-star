But undeterred by the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; words from Passaris, Miguna continued talking, gesturing at the operator recording the video.&ldquo;You are chasing men all over... Esther, nobody wants you. ..you are too old... nobody wants you..who wants you ..who wants you...?&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Esther... nobody wants you ... you think you are beautiful... you are not.&rdquo; Clad in a black suit and red tie, Miguna told Passaris all she has is the colour of her skin.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just colour...Esther, it&rsquo;s just colour... Without the colour you are nothing...you are absolutely zero...you are zero...you are not beautiful... You have nothing...,&rdquo; said the lawyer.&ldquo;The cartels who think you are beautiful... they sent you here.&rdquo; Koinange and the crew are seen unshaken and laughing at the argument as they go on with the show.But Passaris, who was left speechless, got more furious as time went by.She told Miguna off, saying, &ldquo;Get used to the idea that you will never be the governor. Shut up, really...you are so racist....&rdquo;In a post on Twitter yesterday, Passaris urged women not to be discouraged by men like Miguna.&ldquo;Men like Miguna have no place or role to play in our empowerment. He is part of the problem. Let&rsquo;s be even more determined to take our place at the table,&rdquo; she said.Passaris said women are not perfect but continue striving for more.&ldquo;I encourage women not to shy away from leadership for fear of victimisation, character assassination and prejudices of patriarchy,&rdquo; she said.But Miguna said via Twitter that some parts of the video were omitted.&ldquo;The video omits the portion where Passaris accused me of rape... She did not specify whom I allegedly raped,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cartels are out in full force with falsehoods, propaganda and threats. Let&rsquo;s stick to the truth.&rdquo;Miguna said &ldquo;the cartels&rdquo; are trying to besmirch his reputation with edited and contrived videos, adding, &ldquo;but the people of Nairobi have decided.&rdquo;&ldquo;Esther Passaris purports to be vying for Nairobi governor as Esther Passaris ... she cannot therefore project herself merely as a woman,&rdquo; he said. Noting he has immense respect for women, Miguna said he does not respect hypocrites and opportunists.&ldquo;...those who use their gender to seek or obtain advantages that they don&rsquo;t deserve,&rdquo; he said.
