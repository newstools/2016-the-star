Ground equipment and motorcycles worth Sh4.4 million bought by the Kisumu government in 2014 are lying idle.According to the Auditor General s financial statement report for 2014-15, the equipment and six Yamaha motorcycles have been in store since delivery on September 29, 2014.The report says the motorcycles have not been registered with the registrar of motor vehicles.The county paid the money to Duponet Systems in July 2014, but there was no valid contract because the contractor did not sign the local service order.In addition, the annual procurement plan was not provided for audit verification to ascertain how the project was initiated, Auditor General Edward Ouko says. There were no opening tender minutes, technical evaluation reports and contract agreement for audit review, the report said. Ouko said Kisumu residents may not derive the benefits of the equipment if it is not put to proper use. Consequently, the expenditure of the Sh4.4 million for the year-ended June 30 could not be confirmed, he said.ANOTHER SH3M QUERIEDThe report said in renovating the deputy governor s house, the propriety of Sh3 million paid to a contractor could not be ascertained.It says it was not clear why the contract agreement was signed on February 26, 2015, when the invoice had been issued on August 28, 2014, six months earlier.According to the report, the compound had partially been landscaped although the house had not been occupied because the bathroom was yet to be completed and there were two extensions to be built, which were not in the bill of quantities. Physical verification of the building revealed a fence indicated in the BQ at Sh150,000 had not been done, yet a certificate had been issued for payments of the same and the contractor was not on site, the report said.The Auditor General could not obtain sufficient and appropriate documents to provide a basis for an audit opinion. I do not express an opinion on the financial statements, Ouko said at the end of the report.
