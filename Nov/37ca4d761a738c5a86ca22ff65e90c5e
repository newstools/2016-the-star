ODM leaders should emulate the late Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwang s style of leadership, party chief Raila Odinga has said.He said Kajwang was a staunch supporter of ODM and was ready to defend the party at all costs. Raila spoke yesterday after laying a wreath at Kajwang s mausoleum in Waondo, Homa Bay county.Present were governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Senators Boy Juma Boy (Kwale) and Moses Kajwang (Homa Bay).ODM national chairman John Mbadi (Suba) and his deputy chairman Paul Otuoma (Funyula) were among other ODM legislators present.Kajwang died undergoing treatment at the Mater Hospital on November 19, 2014.Doctors had treated Kajwang for high blood pressure as well as cardiac arrest.Raila said Kajwang used to consult the ODM leadership, despite understanding the party affairs and structures well. Otieno was one of the greatest soldiers ODM and I had around. He was always there to energise our team for a noble cause, he said.Raila urged party leaders to emulate Kajwang s attitude, noting that his loyalty saw him rise in the party. Kajwang s tireless fight for the party made him receive a distinguished platinum award. Everyone should embrace his inspiring spirit, he said.Raila described Kajwang as a good strategiser, able to approach issues with a clear mind.He said Kajwang s intelligence enabled him to compose the popular bado mapambano [the struggle continues] slogan which inspires people to soldier on during times of struggle.Joho and Awiti said they are determined to ensure the vision of the late Kajwang is fulfilled. Kajwang yearned for a Raila presidency and I can assure you that we are out to make this come to pass in 2017, Joho said.The leaders urged party supporters to register as voters in readiness for the 2017 polls. We don t want to see voter apathy during elections. We have to ensure Raila wins the presidency, Joho said.Kajwang was elected to represent Mbita constituency in the 2007 election.In 2013, he was elected the Homa Bay senator.Upon his death, his brother Moses Kajwang won the election to succeed him.
