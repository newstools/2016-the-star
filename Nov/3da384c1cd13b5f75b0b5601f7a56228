A newlywed has spoken of her devastation after her rare pregnancy left her without a baby - and instead gave her cancer.Stephanie Theobald, from Manchester UK, was left heartbroken at her 12-week scan when the nurse revealed she couldn't find a baby's heartbeat.The 35-year-old was told her only options were to wait and give birth naturally or undergo surgery.But when doctors performed a biopsy it was revealed it had been a complete molar pregnancy - meaning abnormal cells had grown instead of a baby.Tests revealed she had a malignant tumour and needed chemotherapy - which could put an end to her ever having children.Theobald said: 'I'm one of six children - the only girl and the last one to have kids. My mum was so excited for me to get pregnant.'We didn't wait until the normal three month mark to tell everyone because we were so excited.'It was just awful. When you go for a scan, it's meant to be a happy time. We both just came crashing down.'
