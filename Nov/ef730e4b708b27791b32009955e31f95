What assurance do Kenyans have with regards to the titles they hold?," he said.According to him, Kaimenyi and his team will be telling Kenyans the safeguards the Ministry and the land commission have put in place to deal with unscrupulous Land Buying Companies (Case of Kihiu Mwiti &amp; Mbo-i-kamiti), malpractices in land control boards (Case Meru Land Board) and if the move to disband the boards streamlined their operations.Also read:Lack of funding blocks land reforms - SwazuriIn regards to Idle land and Question of Squatters, Esipisu said, "A Mombasa court recently ruled that a person who doesn't develop his land for over 10 years has no right to claim ownership.
