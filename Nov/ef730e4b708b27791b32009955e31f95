During the summit, Land CS Jacob Kaimenyi will also brief the nation on who owns the largest tracks of land in the country.Statehouse spokesman Manoah Esipisu on Sunday said the summit was in line with Jubilee campaign manifesto to address land injustices."As you know the land currency is an important one in our social-economic development, and you are also aware that the Jubilee administration promised the land answer if it took office," he said.Esipisu said the CS will seek to answer how far the government has implemented recommendations of reports &#8232;on illegal and irregular allocation of land."We want to know whether the Ministry has been able to repossess any land that was &#8232;irregularly allocated to politicians or churches, who owns the largest tracts of land in Kenya and whether Coast counties have borne the brunt of the historical land &#8232;injustices," Esipisu said.Read:Cord in panic over land reforms - State HouseEsipisu said the question as to how far the ministry and the NLC was in implementing reforms was paramount."As you are aware corruption is eating us badly in land acquisition, we want to know how is the Ministry dealing with several questions of double titling and numerous cases of Kenyans holding faulty or even fake title deeds. What assurance do Kenyans have with regards to the titles they hold?," he said.According to him, Kaimenyi and his team will be telling Kenyans the safeguards the Ministry and the land commission have put in place to deal with unscrupulous Land Buying Companies (Case of Kihiu Mwiti &amp; Mbo-i-kamiti), malpractices in land control boards (Case Meru Land Board) and if the move to disband the boards streamlined their &#8232;operations.Also read:Lack of funding blocks land reforms - SwazuriIn regards to &#8232;Idle land and Question of Squatters, Esipisu said, "A Mombasa court recently ruled that a person who doesn't develop his land for over 10 years has no right to claim ownership. What does this jurisprudence by Environment and Land court Judge Anne Omollo mean to the future of land ownership,? What is the future of idle land?".
