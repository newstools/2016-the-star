Two groups held parallel protests for and against Governor Mwangi Wairia in a political showdown in Murang a town on Monday. One faction convened by lobby groups demanded Wairia s prosecution while the other, which was made up of his supporters, protested against what they called political witch-hunt.The two demos brought into play the sharp divisions in the county between those who support the incumbent and those who back Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau. Kamau has announced he will run for governor.Some of the protesters demanded that Wairia resign over allegations of misappropriation of public funds in his government.They marched to his office but were denied entry by heavily-armed riot police officers, who had erected a road block outside the county headquarters.Hundreds of youths later proceeded to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, where they presented a petition to have the governor prosecuted for corruption. They threatened to sue the DPP if the governor is not arraigned in court in seven days.The petition raised queries over the purchase of 34 acres in the 2013-14 financial year for Sh340 million.Led by Charles Njoroge, a resident, the youths demanded thorough investigations into the matter and those found culpable charged in court. We are wondering why the office of the DPP has not yet taken any action against the county, Njoroge said Njoroge.But the rival group dismissed them, saying they were not genuine and had been paid to demonstrate against the governor. Wairia dismissed the demonstrations, which he said had been stage-managed by his rivals. I know they only want to keep us busy with their interruptions so that they can distract us from working for the people, he said. I was investigated by the EACC and they gave me a clean bill of health. People are now wiser and will vote for leaders based on their development record.
