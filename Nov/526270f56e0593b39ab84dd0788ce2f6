Murang&rsquo;a clerics and traders have urged politicians to conduct mature politics, instead of promoting intolerance.The clergymen and businesspeople on Sunday said they are against any form of political intolerance, as witnessed in the past few months.They said the recent standoff between Governor Mwangi Wairia and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau was appalling. &ldquo;Their course will lead the county to the dogs,&rdquo; pastor Stephen Ndahi of Garden of Joy Church said.They criticised Wairia for giving orders to dump 100 tonnes of manure on Mumbi grounds. It appeared to be an effort to block Kamau from launching his manifesto on Saturday last week. The clerics and the traders spoke at a prayer meeting in Chomo shopping centre, Gatanga subcounty.&ldquo;It was petty for the governor to try and block his opponent from conducting his political affairs. Everyone has the right to hold such a function so long as the law is observed and all requirements met,&rdquo; Ndahi.Pastor Johanna Ndirangu lashed out at the politicians for using the youth to cause mayhem at political rallies, warning they are breeding anarchy ahead of the 2017 polls.&ldquo;The church is against any politician hell-bent on misleading the Murang&rsquo;a youth to cause chaos at political functions. We want peace during this campaign season,&rdquo; he said.Trader Joram Kinyanjui urged politicians to maintain peace and order during their campaigns, saying violence will hurt business.&ldquo;We appeal to politicians to desist from inciting youths for the sake of businesses and our county economy,&rdquo; he said.Kinyanjui called on all hopefuls to respect the current leaders, adding Wairia should be given space to complete his work. &ldquo;As traders, we are content with his leadership. It will be wrong for other politicians to distract him from his work,&rdquo; he said.The businessman took issue with Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo for deserting Wairia and, instead, campaigning against him and for Jamleck.
