As many are aware, Nairobi normally has two seasonal rain cycles annually. It is with the onset of heavy rains that the normally accessible park roads suddenly become very challenging and even not drivable in places. With the experience of driving through the park on thousands of occasions almost daily over many years, I eventually made mental notes as to the most drivable roads during very wet weather.Certain parts of the park, especially the notorious black cotton sections, get swamped and cause the road surfaces to become thick and muddy. However, there are certain roads that are slightly better due to the rocky nature of the area. For example, during the heavy floods in April-May, many vehicles got stuck. During that time I had international visitors who wanted to see the park. So I drove in at the East gate with a 4x4 vehicle and promised to take them on a good game drive that would include the Athi basin.At first I did not realise how serious the boggy sections were and nearly became a victim of the section just after number 7 junction heading south towards No8. Therefore, the route I chose was slightly longer rougher and rockier but at least drivable.I would highly recommend that drivers avoid the entire forest area, and be very careful and consider some sections near Kingfisher picnic spot. Getting stuck can be an unpleasant experience that could result in costly vehicle damages and staying in the park for many extra hours at night in the hope of being rescued. Rather be safe than sorry.
