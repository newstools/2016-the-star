Kenyan entrepreneur Chris Kirubi foresees a bleak future for the US following the announcement of Donald Trump as the president-elect in Wednesday&rsquo;s polls.Speaking at the Intercontinental Hotel, Nairobi, Kirubi said:, &quot;If Trump&rsquo;s approach to politics is similar to his business practice, America may be headed for turbulent times,&quot;.&quot;We can only wait and see what he [Trump] does, but if he runs the country how he runs his companies avoiding taxes so society can benefit, then it will be difficult,&quot; Kirubi said.Kirubi was speaking during the last day of the fourth annual Angel Fair Africa forum.The fair is an event that brings together accelerators, incubators and emerging businesses from across the African continent and investors to grow the continent&rsquo;s entrepreneurial capacity.Kirubi challenged investors to explore more opportunities for business on the continent as African markets are exceeding all performance expectations.&quot;It is laughable that foreign investors consider Africa high risk. They make four to five per cent return on investment while in Africa we are making 30 to 40 per cent,&quot; Kirubi added.Angel Fair Africa was founded by Ghanaian Business Eric Osiokwan.&quot;My vision was to create a Shark Tank for the African market. We connect start ups and accelerators to real entrepreneurs because we believe African problems will be solved by African solutions,&quot; Osiakwan said.Over 43 selected investors and 20 curated entrepreneurs took part in the fair.Other keynote speakers at the forum included Tim Draper, Founding Partner of Draper Associates and Dave McClure, Managing Partner of 500 Startups.
