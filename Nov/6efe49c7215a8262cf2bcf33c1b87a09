Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyot is likely to seek re-election on a Kanu ticket in the 2017 general election.This emerged after Kanu chair Gideon Moi and secretary general Nick Salat were at the constituency on Sunday.The leaders were in the area for a fund raiser in aid of Arorwet Catholic church and asked Kenyans "not to elect thieves".The three later attended an interdenominational prayers to welcome Governor Isaac Ruto at Bomet Stadium.Salat hinted that the MP was bracing to join New Kanu and urged locals to re-elect him on Kanu ticket."Your MP is joining us. He is tired of hopping from one party to another but he is willing to come back to Kanu," Salat said.Before Salat spoke, Cheruiyot told his supporters not to look at political parties but deeds of leaders during the next polls."Nobody should force me to use a Range Rover to a rural area where I know it will be hard for it to move around," the MP said.He said the most important thing is to reach the destination "whether one rides on a probox or any other car".Moi asked those in attendance to elect leaders whose performance has been tried and tested."Let us scrutinize their performance record. And let us walk knowing that Kanu is the only lasting party to reckon," he said.Kuresoi residents have asked the MP not to join Jubilee saying the ruling coalition "lacks democracy"."We want a down-to-earth leader who goes to the grassroots to start projects. A party will not help us in any way," former URP chairman Jonah Sigei said.Read: Do not join Jubilee, Kuresoi South residents urge MPCheruiyot asked DP William Ruto to respect Gideon, being a father with a wife and children.DP Ruto will tour the constituency next week to drum support for Jubilee against the brewing rebellion.More than 15 jubilee aspirants have declared interest in the race for Kuresoi South MP.Read: Why Kuresoi is turning out as hotbed of Kanu vs Jubilee politics
