Police are investigating the cause of a fire that gutted the administration block of Furaha Primary School, Limuru, on Thursday.The fire, which started in the evening, destroyed offices and dormitories on the second floor. Area police boss Samuel Obara said investigators suspect the fire was caused by an electricity fault. There was a blackout and when the lights came back on, the building caught fire, he said. Nobody was hurt. Former Kiambu TNA chairman William Josiah urged the county to buy bigger fire engines. The county government should learn from this, he said. After about 30 minutes fire engines tanks were empty and the fire had not been contained.
