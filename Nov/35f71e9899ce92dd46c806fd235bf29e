South Sudan's traditional leaders can play a key leadership role in enhancing reconciliation efforts among warring communities, and building lasting peace.The country s Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) said this on Monday, noting they have successfully served as mediators and adjudicators during conflict.Chairman Festus Mogae said the traditional leaders implement positive traditional forms of peacekeeping, conflict resolution and intervention on behalf of victims of injustice. I appeal to you, as I have done to the rest of the leaders of this country, to go all out for peace and reconciliation. Extend friendship to all, including estranged members of the opposition, offering assurances of safety, said Mogae.He told a Juba meeting of the Chiefs' Councils of South Sudan that the elders' voice must continue to be heard across communities and throughout the country .Some 655 chiefs representing 28 states and Yei administrative area attended the meeting.Mogae urged inclusive participation in the implementation of transitional security arrangements. The key message I have sought to articulate regarding inclusivity is that it is not, and should not, be about individuals. It is and should be about communities and all other parties that have a stake in the peace process," he said.He noted the parties include political parties, church organisations, women, civil society and the youth. What we need at this stage, is achieving maximum awareness about peace agreement among communities. This is why nationwide campaigns and reconciliation is critical, he added.The JMEC is a body of international officials and experts set up in 2015 to monitor the peace deal between conflicting parties in the country.Council president Deng Garang said the solution to the conflict is in our hands We therefore need to be partners in the peace process (and work) together with the international organisation," said Garang."We know the politicians in the government and those in the opposition. They are our people. We need to talk to them."The chiefs pledged to be peace ambassadors among tribes in their jurisdictions.Read: Dialogue and compromise can secure the future of South SudanAlso read: South Sudan has been under international pressure to accept a UN regional protection force, which will help the existing UN mission, UNMISS, stabilise the five-year-old nation, where civil conflict erupted in December 2013 and a peace deal in 2015 failed to stick."We have agreed without precondition because the resolution is clear and we want the country to move forward," he told Reuters by telephone on November 26.
