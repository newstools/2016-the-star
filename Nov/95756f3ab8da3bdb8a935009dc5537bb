Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) is hopeful the government will honour the Sh54 billion pledge made to teachers. In the next four years teachers will not go to the streets to demand pay, he said. Sossion said the government should now hire more teachers to end the shortage. He spoke during the opening of Lorraine Girls High School in Letin, Bureti constituency, on Friday.
