Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyot has hinted at running for releection on the Kanu ticket in 2017, ending speculation he will join the Jubilee Party.He spoke at Arorwet Catholic Church in his constituency on Sunday. Nobody should force me to use a Range Rover in the rural area where I know [the terrain] is not suitable for it, Cheruiyot said, alluding to the difficulties the Jubilee Party is facing in the rural areas, despite it being a huge outfit.This seemed to end the possibility of him ending his differences with Deputy President William Ruto and running on the JP ticket.Cheruiyot told residents not to vote for leaders based on the party but to evaluate what they have done for them.Baringo Senator Gideon Moi urged Kenyans not to elect leaders on the basis of party euphoria but on their performance record.Moi said Kanu will be around for many more years to come and it is the only party to reckon with. There is no other party, the new Kanu is getting stronger, he said.Kanu secretary general Nick Salat said Cheruiyot will soon join them and appealed to residents to reelect him. Cheruiyot has on many occasions criticised the Jubilee leadership for massive corruption.They include the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal, cases of landgrabbing and the alleged loss of Sh5.2 billion at the Ministry of Health.
