David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, has congratulated Donald Trump, describing his victory in the US presidential election as &ldquo;one of the most exciting nights of my life.&rdquo;Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for Louisiana Senate, told his Twitter followers: &ldquo;Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!&rdquo;In another tweet he said: &ldquo;Donald J. Trump now has the chance to become one of the greatest Americans to have ever lived - we have the moral high ground, 100%!&rdquo;Duke, who founded the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1974, also described Wikileaks founder Julian Assange as a &ldquo;hero&rdquo;:Duke had given his backing to Trump late last year, telling listeners to his radio show: &ldquo;The Jewish knives are coming out on Donald Trump &hellip; How come it&rsquo;s against American values to want to preserve the heritage of the country? We&rsquo;re overwhelmingly a Christian country and overwhelmingly a European country.&rdquo;Ku Klux Klan-supporting newspaper The Crusader, offered its support to Trump earlier this month &ndash; prompting the release of a campaign statement saying: &ldquo;Mr Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form.&ldquo;This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign.&rdquo;At the launch of his Senate campaign in July, Duke talked of the &ldquo;massive racial discrimination going on right now against European Americans,&rdquo; and what he called a biased media working against him. He called the Black Lives Matter movement a &ldquo;terrorist organisation&rdquo; and said he wanted equal rights for everyone&rdquo;.
