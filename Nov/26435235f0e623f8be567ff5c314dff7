Kenya will win the war against terrorism more efficiently if the media partners with the state, the National Counter Terrorism Centre has said. The centre yesterday said the partnership would address violent extremism. “Responsible reporting of terrorism incidents will prevent glorification of terrorist actors, which usually plays into the hands of terrorists seeking publicity,” said NCTC head of communication Gerald Mong’are. The media, unwittingly, has been used by terrorists to advance their agenda, Mong’are said. The NCTC was established in September 2003 after a Cabinet meeting, becoming the first such centre in the world. It was inaugurated in 2004 when it became an organ of the National Security Advisory Council. “Many confuse the NCTC with the ATPU. The Anti-Terror Police Unit is represented in the NCTC. Our core mandate is to detect, deter and disrupt terrorism,” Mong’are said. On Wednesday, the centre trained Coast journalists on counter-terrorism measures and responsible reporting.
