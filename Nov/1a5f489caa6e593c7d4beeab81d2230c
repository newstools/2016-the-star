Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto yesterday said in Bomet he will resist any attempts to phase out Probox cars, which many residents use as taxis to make a living.He said recent orders by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett to prohibit vehicles from carrying passengers and keep them out of business was wrong. Operators have no alternative, he said. The majority of the Kenyan youths were jobless and now earn a living from the Probox, hence, it beats logic for the government to deny them a source of living without offering any alternative, Rutto said.He urged the government to find a solution by working with operators, instead of issuing orders. Rutto said the government has a responsibility to create wealth and job opportunities, not to kill them. How does the government expect the rural population to reach their homes if it bans these vehicles without coming up with alternative means of transport? he said. Let them bring one Nissan matatu to replace very Probox removed from the road. He said the youth, who are the majority of the operators, face financial problems and the government should not worsen their situation.
