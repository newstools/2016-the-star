Africa has the potential of being a donor continent if it unites and exploits its vast natural resources, Tanzanian President John Magufuli has said.Magufuli, when he was hosted for a state banquet by President Uhuru Kenyatta, expressed the need for African countries to partner in development for the benefit of their citizens.The current East African Community chairman assured Kenya of his support in accelerating the EAC agenda as well as enhancing regional development."With EAC s population of 165 million people, add the regional economic blocs of COMESA and SADC with a combined population of over 400 million people and other African economic blocs including ECOWAS, the continent is poised to become a donor community," he said on Monday night.President Uhuru Kenyatta, his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta during the state banquet at State House, Nairobi, October 31. /PSCUHe underscored the need for harnessing the vast natural resources in the five East African community member states towards economic development of the region.Magufuli also urged the African nations to guard against outside forces, with selfish motives, which could be fuelling turmoil within the continent."For instance, there is no reason why the Democratic Republic of Congo with its vast natural resources would be wallowing in poverty," he said.President Kenyatta said the presence of a significant number of Kenyan investors in Tanzania was a clear testimony that the citizens of the two neighbouring countries were brothers and sisters.The President emphasized that EAC member states are not in competition with each other but complement one another for the mutual benefit of their citizens."The success of the Kenyan economy is beneficial to Tanzanians and the success of Tanzanian economy is equally good to Kenyans," President Kenyatta said.He said the Magufuli visit has opened a new chapter in the strengthening of the bilateral and brotherly relations between the two countries.President Uhuru Kenyatta, his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta during the state banquet at State House, Nairobi, October 31. /PSCUThe President welcomed the Tanzanian government s assurance of support to Kenyan investors keen on doing business in the country, adding that Kenya is also open to the Tanzanian business community.President Kenyatta said the current crop of leaders in the East African region need to emulate the region s founding fathers by working together to liberate their citizens economically.Deputy President William Ruto commended the Tanzanian leader for honouring the invitation by President Kenyatta, saying Kenya valued its fraternal relations with Tanzania.He said Kenya regards the leadership of President Magufuli highly, especially in steering the EAC to greater heights.The Deputy President assured the Tanzanian leader of the country s support in the realisation of a fully integrated EAC.Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed said President Magufuli chairmanship of the EAC has seen the region witness major strides, especially in the accreditation process of South Sudan as a new member.First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretaries, Chief of Defence Forces General Samson Mwathethe, diplomats and other senior government officials attended the state banquet.
