Jackson Okwiri, a younger sibling of Olympian Rayton Okwiri, qualified for the finals of the Kenya Open Championship at Kaloleni Social Hall following brilliant displays.But his win didn t come on a silver platter as his opponent gave him all he could handle.Okwiri Junior defeated Charles Majanja of Dallas Muthurwa 2-1 in the three-rounder. In an interview, he said: It was a tough match as my opponent displayed great skills in both attack and defence but I expect a tough one in the finals tomorrow (today). So far I m happy with my performance but it s too early to celebrate, said Okwiri Junior, who is seeking to break into the national team from coast region. Okwiri senior is the only boxer from coast region who has donned national team colors over the past one decade.The elder Okwiri still works at Kenya Prisons but plies his trade in the AIBA Pro Boxing ranks, which is a semi professional competition introduced by AIBA last year.Another boxer from coast, Abdallah Athumani was all smiles upon qualifying for the final of the light-flyweight division without throwing a single jab.Athumani savoured a walkover when Kenya Defence Forces boxer, Edwin Mudhune arrived late for the three-round scheduled bout.Posta s Joshua Musyoki also defeated Nairobi s Dennis Muthama on majority points in the flyweight semi-final.From the first gong, Musyoki tormented his opponent with heavy body punches and it was no surprise when he racked up a 3-0 win.Earlier, Matayo Kenya of Kenya Defence Forces made it to the semis with a 3-0 win over Dallas boxer Abednego Kyalo.The finals for the event will start this afternoon at the Kaloleni Social Hall.Albert Matito urged spectators to throng the venue in anticipation of some explosive final matches.
