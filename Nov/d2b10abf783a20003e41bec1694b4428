Stop fighting projects you initiated when you were the Prime Minister, Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has told off Cord leader Raila Odinga.Speaking in Bungoma on Saturday when he toured the Chesikaki water project, Wamalwa accused Raila of making disparaging remarks about the projects the Jubilee government is implementing. He said most of them were designed and approved by his former office in line with Vision 2030. It is unfortunate that the former Prime Minister is suffering from selective amnesia, and is now fighting projects that he himself paid for the design, Wamalwa said.He cited Sh100 million that the now defunct Office of the Prime Minister paid for the design of Itare Dam, that Raila is criticising. Last week, Odinga termed the water programme in Mau Forest, Nakuru county, a secret project by Jubilee. He said the dam poses threats to the environment, because its implementation is likely to make several downstream counties dry.Raila says the project, started in June 2015, will provide Nakuru Township with water by drawing from rivers whose source is the Mau Forest.
