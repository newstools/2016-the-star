An education stakeholder in Lari, Kiambu, has supported new rules to curb cheating in national exams.Kibagare Primary School Alumni coordinator John Waweru said leakage of questions will not be easy since the government is monitoring exam handlers.On Friday he praised Education CS Fred Matiang i for coming up with rules on how government officers, police and head teachers handle exam materials. Waweru said they will minimise cases of result cancellation. Whenever national exams start, no student has a clue where a leakage would be obtained and whenever it is mentioned, parents are worried their children would be punished, he said.Waweru said exams should only serve to show a child s academic strength. The KCPE exam began yesterday countrywide. It will end tomorrow.
