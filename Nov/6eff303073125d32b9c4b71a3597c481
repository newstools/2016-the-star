Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto has called on the national government to put more resources in the arid and semi-arid areas to curb cattle rustling and other crimes. He said poverty has led many youths from the areas to engage in cattle theft and other retrogressive cultural practices. He spoke at Kamuino village during a thanksgiving ceremony of Rajab Chembus who graduated from Chuka University. He said many youths are getting into crime because they are idle. The MP named West Pokot, Turkana , Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and some parts in the Coast as areas that need special attention. He also called for the arrest of those who are perpetrating such crimes from the neighboring counties. We want Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to arrest all those behind the attacks, not politicians alone.
