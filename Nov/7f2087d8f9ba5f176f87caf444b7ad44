A Nairobi court has summoned an investigating officer to explain why a vehicle belonging to a businessman charged with obtaining goods worth Sh25 million by false pretences is being impounded by police. Milimani senior principal magistrate Joyce Gandani issued the summons for the officer after lawyer Ian Maina, representing Simeon Ominde, said police are illegally holding his client&rsquo;s vehicle. Ominde is accused of intending to defraud Adan Ahmed of 500 HP 1515 laptops between August 1 and October 5 by pretending he could pay for them. He denied the fraud charges and was released on Sh3 million bail, pending the hearing on November 23. The lawyer said the case against his client is civil and not criminal. He accused police of harassing his client by charging him with criminal offences. This prompted the magistrate to issue summons for the officer to appear in court on November 15.
