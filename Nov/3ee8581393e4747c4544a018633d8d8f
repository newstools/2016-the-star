Three traffic police officers were admitted to different hospitals on Thursday following injuries sustained in an accident involving a matatu they had arrested.The officers, while on a crackdown of defective vehicles at Kiambaa area on Nairobi-Nakuru highway, reportedly opted to drive the vehicle to their base station.Benson Ngige, the driver of the matatu registered under the MML Sacco, said one of the officers volunteered to take the vehicle to Kikuyu police station before the accident.He said that the cops had ordered him, as well as the passengers aboard the vehicle at the time it was stopped, to alight for routine inspection."They told me to meet them at the station. Before long, I got news that the vehicle was involved in an accident at Zambezi area," Ngige said.Area OCPD Kiptoo Birgen told the press at Kikuyu hospital, where the officers were rushed, that the matatu rammed a lorry that was on its way to Nairobi."It seems whoever was driving the vehicle lost control of it and hit the lorry from the rear," Kiptoo said.Kiptoo confirmed that chief inspector Rashid Koko - Kikuyu base commander; deputy inspector Stephen Moibei and an unidentified officer were inside the vehicle.He said Koko who was seriously injured and was transferred to the Aga Khan Hospital for specialised treatment.The OCPD said the other officers were receiving treatment and were in stable condition, adding that investigations into the cause of the accident have been launched.However, the police boss declined to reveal who was driving the matatu, saying they had not interrogated the officers since they were in pain."As of now, we cannot say who was driving the matatu, but investigations will tell. The officers are in pain. In fact, one was unconscious," Kiptoo said.Kikuyu hospital administrators declined to brief the press on the condition of the injured officers.The affected commuters condemned the police officers over their decision to drive the vehicle to the station on their own.The law requires that a vehicle found defective during a routine inspection be towed to the nearest police station for safe custody."We cannot understand why they drove it. The vehicle should have been towed or driven to the police station by its owner in the company of an officer," Nancy Njenga said.MML Sacco secretary Samuel Kamau asked the government to take stern action against the officers alleged to have driven the vehicle."Our company is shaken when we count losses instead of profits. The vehicle had all the requirements to be on the road. The vehicle is also new," Kamau said.
