Barely a day after visiting Kenya, Tanzanian President John Magufuli has authorised construction of a highway that might suffocate Masai Mara National Reserve.The highway will cut Serengeti National Park into two close to the Kenyan border, meaning it might interfere with animals crossing over to Kenya.Conservationists warn Kenya - especially Narok county - will be hardest hit as the highway may affect the annual wildebeest migration, the largest remaining migratory system in the world.The move is expected to open another round of battles with conservationists in Kenya and Tanzania, who successfully stopped the proposed highway last year through the courts.In an online document, the Tanzanian government said funds have already been set aside for a paved (bitumen) road for the towns of Natta, Mugumu, and Loliondo.The map shows the first phase will go up to Tabora B Gate at the park boundary. The next phase will extend this highway across the park to Loliondo, then presumably continue south. Construction will take 36 months. The works consist of upgrading the existing unpaved road to Bitumen standard with a 6.5m wide carriageway and 1.5m wide shoulders on each side for a total length of 59.65 km between Natta and Tabora B Gate, tender documents from the Ministry of Works state.Tanzanian activists have pledged to stop the highway initially proposed five years ago. We're sorry to announce that plans to bisect the Serengeti with a commercial highway are again underway, the Serengeti Watch, the NGO that successfully stopped the highway told members last week. We must renew efforts to educate those in power about the disastrous impact of the highway and rally support for a better alternative that does not destroy a priceless World Heritage. Serengeti Watch accused the Tanzanian government of ignoring scientific opinion against the road. Those of you who have followed us know what this means. Serengeti Watch and many other organisations, including the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, opposed this disastrous project for years, they said.The move comes barely a year after Uganda-Tanzania oil pipeline ran into a battle.This was after some designs showed it would cut through the highly endangered Serengeti park.Magufuli left Kenya on Tuesday after a two-day visit during which he and President Uhuru Kenyatta agreed to cooperate on infrastructure development.They launched the Ngong Road/Lenana interchange during an occasion that saw Uhuru praise Magufuli for supporting infrastructure projects that will boost their ties.More on this: Uhuru, Magufuli officially open Southern bypass
