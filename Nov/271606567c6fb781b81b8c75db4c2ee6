The internal auditor who uncovered the alleged Sh5 billion scandal at the Ministry of Health is set to appear before the Senate Health Committee today. Bernard Muchere, a certified fraud examiner, will be questioned a week after the grilling of Health top bosses CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri, who said no money was lost. They turned the heat on Muchere, alleging he possibly leaked the draft audit. This comes amid questions on why Muraguri wanted the auditor prematurely transferred. There have been concerns the committee is soft on top ministry officials. Some civil servants have suggested the National Assembly PAC institute a parallel probe.
