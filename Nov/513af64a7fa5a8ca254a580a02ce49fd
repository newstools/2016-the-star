Myoot Kipsigis council of elders on Tuesday condemned police brutality meted against Governor Isaac Rutto during a function at Silibwet stadium on Sunday.Bartai arap Milgo, the councils' chair in Bomet and Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) national secretary David Sang demanded the transfer of county commissioner Bernard Leparmarai.They said they want the commissioner moved for "handling the matter casually", citing the latter's response on the attack as 'reckless'."His statement relating to the incident depicted a failed system of authority and thus cannot be entrusted to his lead the people anymore," the elders said."Claiming that a stone hit the governor yet we all know it was a teargas canister hurled at him is not right," Bartai said.Leparmarai has since defended the police over the incident saying they averted a what would have been a worse situation.He dismissed reports that police threw teargas at Rutto adding that the governor may have been hit by stone hurled by some youth during the melee.Sang told the press in Bomet town that Jubilee was to blame for the chaos further noting that police used unnecessarily excessive force.They claimed Rutto was being targeted by his influential political nemesis in the Jubilee Administration.The leaders blamed the resistance on Rutto's strong opposition of the government through his newly formed CCM party. "We see the national government s hand in all this matter. It seems the police were under firm instructions to act in the manner they did," Sang said.For his part, Bartai said it was sad that the incident comes at a time when they have rooted for reconciliatory meetings among the feuding politicians from the region."We know the incident happened because of the animosity and bad blood that our local leaders have against themselves. We have always insisted in bringing these people together but some MPs are resisting," he added.He called on the national government and particularly the IG Joseph Boinett to take decisive action against the errant officers.Former councilors Samwel Barbaret and Alexander Chepkowny also voiced similar concerns saying the county commissioner should be transfered immediately.
