"We see the national government&rsquo;s hand in all this matter. It seems the police were under firm instructions to act in the manner they did," Sang said.For his part, Bartai said it was sad that the incident comes at a time when they have rooted for reconciliatory meetings among the feuding politicians from the region."We know the incident happened because of the animosity and bad blood that our local leaders have against themselves. We have always insisted in bringing these people together but some MPs are resisting," he added.He called on the national government and particularly the IG Joseph Boinett to take decisive action against the &lsquo;errant&rsquo; officers.Former councilors Samwel Barbaret and Alexander Chepkowny also voiced similar concerns saying the county commissioner should be transfered immediately.
