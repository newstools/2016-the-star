Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood (pictured) has urged residents to reject calls to vote him out because he is of Indian descent. Former PS Mutea Iringo&rsquo;s representative and personal assistant Dennis Mutembei said the former PS is keen to see a son from a Meru clan become the next MP. The legislator urged Iringo to demonstrate the job opportunities he created for residents while in government. &ldquo;I am more Meru than many [people] because of my involvement in development projects,&rdquo; Dawood said.
