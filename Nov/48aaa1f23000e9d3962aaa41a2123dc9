ODM leader Raila Odinga will have a breakfast meeting with people living with disabilities from across the country at Orange House in Nairobi on Tuesday.Philip Etale, ODM communications director, said the meeting will bring together more than 500 people suffering different forms of disabilities.Etale said the theme of the meeting will be 'Walemavu mbele pamoja na ODM', and that people living with disabilities from all over Kenya have confirmed participation."We want to give hope to persons with disability (and tell them) that even in leadership, disability is not inability," he said in a statement on Friday.Etale added that the intention is also to assure the people of support during party nominations set for February, to give candidates time to prepare for elections."The party leader will be present to assure them of his support and encourage them to go for as many elective positions as possible in the forthcoming polls," he said.Nixon Kakiri, Caucus Interim chairman, said the meeting, which all ODM MPs and officials will attend, will help them forge a united front for the August 8, 2017 general election."We need to be recognised. We want a leader who takes into recognition the plight of persons with disabilities, and that leader is Odinga," he said.Raila has, on several occasions, agitated for equal opportunities to everyone regardless of their physical status.In 2012, he pushed for the doubling of funds allocated to persons with disabilities in the 2013/14 fiscal year.Read: ODM set tough nomination rules ahead of Thursday deadline
