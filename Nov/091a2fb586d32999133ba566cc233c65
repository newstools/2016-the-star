The JSC has transferred 17 Chief Magistrates across the country, chief registrar Anne Amadi said on Friday.Recently, the commission nominated magistrates for appointments in positions of Judges of the Environment and Land Court as well as the high Court."Many other magistrates have been promoted to higher ranks within the magistracy," Amadi said.According to her, the transfers will take effect on January 16th 2017.In the latest changes, Chief Magistrate Alfred Kibiru was moved to Machakos from Chuka while Francis Andayi has been moved to Milimani Law Courts from Kerugoya."Chief Magistrate Evans Makori will be moved to Milimani commercial courts from Meru while Joyce Gandani moves to Kibera from Milimani courts," said a letter signed by Amadi.Chief Magistrates Roselyne Oganyo (Murang'a), Margaret Wachira (Garissa), William Chepseba (Bungoma), Patricia Gichohi (Homabay) and Hannah Ndungu (Busia) will be moved to City Court, Murang'a, Busia, Kiambu and Meru respectively.Others to be moved include Chief Magistrate Samuel Mokua (Oyugis) moving to Kericho, Chief Magistrate Julie Oseko(Kiambu) to Malindi, Wendy Kagendo (Molo) to Nyeri and Chief Magistrate Godfrey Oduor (Limuru) to Nakuru.Samuel Wahome will relocate from Kakamega to Molo, Samuel Soita from Mau to Kerugoya, Cosmos Maundu from Kwale to Garissa and Senior Principal Magistrate Denis Mikoyan from Judiciary Training Institute to Limuru law courts.The transfers come barely two months after the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board said corruption, drunkenness, incompetence, low staff morale and harassment had been cited as the main problems ailing the judiciary.In its final report, the board said half of the cases could be settled through other methods, such as arbitration. We discovered a half of cases in the courts did not have evidence. Various crimes are too minor to detain the criminals while there are many options the courts can use to punish them, said board vice chairperson Roseline Odede.
