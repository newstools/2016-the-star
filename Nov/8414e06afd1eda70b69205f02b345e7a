MCAs from Kilifi have been barred from addressing the media on Sh51 million allegedly stolen from the county's Health department.Speaker Jimmy Kahindi said on Monday this would ensure there was a proper flow of the 'right information' to prevent a mismatch of facts.He made the decision after reports that the amount stolen had risen to Sh1.18 billion.More on this: Kilifi county deny loss of Sh1.18 billion"I shall be the only one speaking on behalf of the MCAs," said Kahindi, who is the chairman of the Committee on General Oversight.He said since the reports were made public there have been demonstrations in the county, which have shifted focus on the probe.He said they have also led to a negative portrayal of Governor Amason Kingi and county MCAs.He said the county is still investigating the matter and has summoned four senior officers to be probed. "They shall summon the IFMIS director, Central Bank officials and branch managers of the banks that conducted the transactions," he said.Read: Kilifi MCAs to summon IFMIS, CBK officials after probe reveals loss of Sh1.8 billionThe Speaker said to date the County Assembly wonders where the figure of Sh1.18 billion came from since none of the MCAs came up with the figure.Last week it emerged that Sh51 million and not Sh45 million was allegedly stolen from the county.It is suspected cartels from IFMIS, the national online payment system, five banks where money was deposited and county officials colluded to loot funds.Also read: EACC, Treasury to audit IFMIS for 'loopholes' used to steal taxpayer moneyThe revelation came three days after 10 county officials were suspended over the missing funds.They include Health chief officer Timothy Malingi and accountants Paul Mwanzo (Treasury), Jacob Konde (Health), John Kalume (Finance) and Josephine Muramba (Education).
