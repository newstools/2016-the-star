Disquiet is brewing at the Luhya Elders Forum over chairman Patrick Wangamati s comment that ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is a Jubilee mole .Sources told the Star yesterday that elders are concerned that Wangamati is making statements without consulting members. They say his comments are misinterpreted as the forum s position. The statement should be taken as a personal one and not the forum s position. We will only make our position as a forum after thorough consultations, the source said.Another source said, Right now, we re concentrating on Luhya unity. The forum brings together 18 members representing the 18 Luhya subtribes.Mudavadi is pushing for the formation of the National Super Alliance to unite opposition leaders to beat the Jubilee Party in the August 8, 2017 polls.
