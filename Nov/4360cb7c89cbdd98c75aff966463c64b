Kenya Ports Authority women s basketball team have blamed their 57-43 loss to FAP of Cameroon in the ongoing FIBA women s club championships on inexperience and stage fright.The dockers who were due to play Ferraviora de Maputo last night in their second match believe naivety was the team s main undoing against the battle hardened Cameroonians who fielded the country s national team currently in preparation for the African cup of Nations qualifiers in January. We started badly trailing 05-15 with several missed scoring chances in the paint but out our act together to win the second quarter 16-14 as the Cameroun side led 27-21 at the break , team coach Anthony Ojukwu said.According to him ,the third quarter was disastrous. The KPA were outscored 21-08 making their 14-09 win the fourth quarter meaningless.Astride Gano Njiogap was the destroyer in chief breaking the dockers defense at will to finish with a game high 23 points while colleague Mba Minna Bella managed 13 points.KPA replied through Mercy Wanyama who scored 15 points while Felmas Adhiambo and Hilda Indasi had seven points each. We have since corrected all the mistakes we made in the first match and will be going for the second a more determined side , Ojukwu said in reference to the teams match against the hosts which was due to tip off at 7.00 pm Kenyan time.The other Kenyan representative United States International University (USIU) were set to play First Bank of Nigeria in their first match at 4.00pm Kenyan time.Coach George Mayienga who watched as First Bank beat former champions Primero de Agosto 67-59 on Saturday said the arrival of Angela Okoth and Sarah Chan who were left behind had given the team a big boost. This is the third straight year we are coming for this games and should surely make a difference this time round , Mayienga said.First Bank who fielded Mexican Rodriguez Brisa Silva who landed in Maputo on Friday direct from Mexico are however still awaiting the arrival of American Bukky Daniels who was still being expected according to Coach Peter Ahmadou.Today,KPA play Etoile Filante from Togo at 2.30 pm Kenyan time while USIU take on Primero de Agosto of Angola at 4.45pm Kenyan time.
