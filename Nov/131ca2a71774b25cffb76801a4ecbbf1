Politicians who badmouth their opponents in the pulpit should be forbidden to speak in church, Bishop Francis Abiero has said. The Maseno South Anglican bishop said many politicians are spreading hate instead of peace.He spoke on Sunday at ACK St Stephen s Cathedral in Kisumu town. Churches are the temples of God. We should focus on preaching peace and unity instead of attacking and causing disunity among Kenyans, Abiero said.
