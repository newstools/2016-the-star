Education CS Fred Matiang'i has scoffed at politicians fond of using school children to gain political mileage. He said the government will not permit the "cheap and petty" misuse of pupils in the guise of offering them aid.Matiang'i backed Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa for banning politicians from supplying food to candidates.Marwa rejected offers by well wishers to provide food to the seven schools in the region, during KCPE exams which ended on Thursday."If all of us go to our schools for campaigns with printed T-shirts that bear our portraits, which type of society will we be living in?" Matiang'i asked."Isn t it common sense that we just cannot do that? The food programme from politicians has nothing to do with children... It is purely petty politics.""You take a loaf of bread, print your portrait and bring it to children. Won't we be satisfied if your portrait is not there? No way; we will not allow it to happen now or in the future."Read: Mombasa KCPE candidates angered after Marwa bans food donations in schoolsMatiang'i said during a tour of Kwale today that primary and secondary schools were under the jurisdiction of the national government.The Cabinet Secretary asked politicians to respect structures of the national government but noted the state was not against the feeding of children.He said those who want to give food to schools must consult deputy county education directors and government officials.Matiang'i also referred to Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga who sponsored mock examinations and added a picture of his on the papers. "I have never seen such madness in my life. Others bought school buses and put pictures on them," he said. "Imagine walking into a school and finding the face of a governor on one wall and that of another pretender on a second wall."Noting many Muslim and Christian organisations do not brag about supporting learning institutions, the CS noted that all he expects to see in schools is a presidential portrait."The Catholic Church supports children in many aspects but does not go around arguing with county and regional commissioners and the Education CS, while telling off everyone," he said.Read: Seven sacked over Rasanga mock exam
