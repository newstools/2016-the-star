Drunken youth on Sunday booed Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and three MPs at a rally at Kianjokoma market, Runyenjes constituency. The legislators had attended a service at the National Independent Church of Africa in the morning before heading to the market to campaign.The MPs were Gichugu s Njogu Barua, Ol Joro Orok s Kamotho Waiganjo, and Mwingi North s John Munuve. They were with former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile. Kivuti has declared he will run for governor.Every time each stood to speak ,the drunken youths would shout him down, despite pleas to calm down. After an hour police surrounded them and attempted to arrest them but the youths ran away. The legislators condemned the group s action and called for tolerance.Kivuti said he will not be deterred by his rivals attempts to disrupt his meetings but will convince voters to elect him by telling them what he has done and what he intends to do for them. If somebody uses abuse in campaigns or tries to disrupt his rivals meetings, the voters should reject him or her because he or she does not qualify to be a leader, he said.Some 2,000 elders gathered in Kairuri grounds in Embu North on Saturday to endorse Kivuti for governor. He will run against incumbent Martin Wambora. On October 22, members from 39 Mbeere community subclans endorsed Kivuti at the Kwa Rumbia holy shrine in Mbeere North. Others interested in becoming governor include Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire, former PS Cyrus Njiru, development management consultant Kithinji Kiragu and psychiatrist Njagih Kumantha. Kivuti said he has provided bursaries to 3,000 needy children, he has provided Siakago residents with clean piped water and initiated tarmacking of the Embu-Siakago road.
