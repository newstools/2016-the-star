The IEBC has published draft ICT regulations that will open its electoral technology to more public scrutiny than in the last elections.The regulations are going through public participation. They require the IEBC to publish details of the company or companies that will provide the network during the elections.The IEBC will also be required to carry out timely end-to-end testing of election technology before deployment for the election process. The commission shall issue a public notice specifying the date, time and place of the testing to invite stakeholders to attend, the draft regulations state.After the 2013 elections, opposition chief Raila Odinga, who had lost to President Uhuru Kenyatta in the race, said TNA and IEBC shared a server through a common ICT provider.Raila said this was how Uhuru and TNA manipulated the results allowing IEBC to declare his rival as the winner. A telecommunication network service provider who intends to provide services to the commission shall disclose to the commission any existing agreement(s) with political parties, agents, or candidates before engagement for telecommunication services in an election, the draft regulations state. The regulations also state that the telecommunication network service providers shall ensure the security, traceability and availability of the network during the election.The IEBC may also conduct audits internally or may decide to contract a reputable firm to conduct an audit of the election technology. The commission may conduct systems reviews to evaluate the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the election technology by assessing: a) the security access to the system, b) the vulnerability of the system from the logs, c) the accuracy and the completeness of the data, the regulations state.The regulations are part of the ongoing reforms triggered by the coming into force of the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016. This legal amendment requires the commission to develop a policy on the progressive use of technology in the electoral process and also make regulations for the adoption and implementation of technology in the electoral process, the commission explained.The Act further establishes an integrated electronic electoral system consisting of voter registration, voter identification and results transmission that shall be used in the next general election. The commission, in line with the amended Act, has established an Elections Technical Advisory Committee to oversee the adoption of technology.
