Education CS Fred Matiang'i and PS Belio Kipsag have said the management of year's national exams was 90 per cent successful.Matiang'i said the support the ministry received from county commissioners ensured that the exams were well coordinated, adding that commissioners should chair County Education Boards."County commissioners are the coordinators of national government functions in counties, so it will be very easy for us as a ministry to work with them," he said on Wednesday."The management of this year's exams is a good example of what the commissioners can do to ensure sanity in schools," he added.The CS said constitutional amendments that saw commissioners deprived of the mandate to chair Education boards was a big mistake.He noted that since the amendment, the Education sector has been infiltrated with politics to a point where boards charge parents illegal levies.Matiang'i said the ministry is committed to restoring the integrity of exams.More on this: KCSE, KCPE will be graded with military precision - Matiang'i"Our education system is one of the most respected in the continent.
