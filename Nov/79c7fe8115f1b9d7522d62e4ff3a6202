The KNH team of surgeons and health workers that separated conjoined twins Blessing and Favour, in the first such operation in Africa where babies were joined in the lower spine is to be highly commended.Coincidentally, the 23-hour operation involving some 60 Health professionals overlapped in real-time with some of the PAC hearings into the Sh1.6 billion scandal at the NYS. Some of the very worst of Kenya was happening alongside some of the very best of Kenya, Africa and the world.The surgical feat showed that a great pool of talent, skill and precision exists in Kenya and is part of a great human resource potential. The NYS hearings exposed marauding packs of thieving bureaucrats.Kenya can perform wonders if no funds earmarked for Afya or indeed any other public service were lost to embezzlement.This phenomenal operation speaks about a Kenya that yearns to be corruption-free. May Blessing and Favour live to see graft in Kenya made a thing of a long-ago past.
