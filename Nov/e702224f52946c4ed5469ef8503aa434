A civil society group has demanded approval of field trials for genetically modified maize. Bunge la Mwananchi national speaker Chekai Musa said the national performance trials, to be conducted by the Kenya Health Inspectorate Service, will let the public know if the crops will be beneficial to farmers or not. He said the civil society supports research, not importation of GM products. The National Environment Management Authority has denied issuing a permit to allow field trails for genetically modified maize in Kenya. Director general Prof Geoffrey Wahungu said the authority has not licensed the environmental release of the national performance trial for GMO maize-MON8100. This is contrary to what had been earlier posted on Nema s official website. In August, the authority s website showed the application has been approved, though no permit has been issued.
