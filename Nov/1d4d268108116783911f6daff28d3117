Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo on Monday reconciled with MCAs after they quarrelled over his graft report and directive that they pull up their socks. Madzayo was criticised by the MCAs after releasing the report on July 11. It described massive corruption in the county under their watch.The MCAs were angered by his recommendations that urged them to pull up their socks in the war against graft.However, with the ongoing probe of Sh51 million stolen from the Health department in Kilifi county, the senator called MCAs for a meeting at Sai Eden Roc Hotel in Malindi. He also met and briefed speaker Jimmy Kahindi and other top county assembly officials on the investigation.The senator told journalists the MCAs are doing the job I wanted . I came to meet MCAs to deliberate on issues. I sought to know their working relations, Madzayo said.On the scandal, the senator said investigations are ongoing. I was here three months ago at the county assembly and highlighted the issues. The MCAs took action and I am happy, he said.Madzayo said funds are misused and officers will be held accountable once the probe is completed.He commended the county government for suspending the 10 officials whose passwords were used to steal the funds. Any official who found guilty shall be prosecuted, he said.The senator said out of the Sh51 million missing, Sh8 million was recovered. Corruption should not be politicised. Many politicians from the political divide have been in Kilifi and talked on the issue of corruption in the county. Corruption is all over, he said.Madzayo said the Ifmis system, which was used to loot the funds, was a facility of the national government. He urged the authorities to improve the equipment to prevent problems in the future.He said there have been similar cases of theft in Kitui and Siaya.
