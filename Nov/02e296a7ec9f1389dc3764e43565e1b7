The cash is normally paid on a weekly basis.The youths converged at the Kisumu Central CDF office where they sought audience with area MP Ken Obura.They told the press they were worried the project might come to an end abruptly yet they don t know the whereabouts of their sacco money.They said they have run into debts as a result of the delayed pay.Read: Sh926m NYS money is safe, says CS Kariuki Kisumu Central constituency manager Nashon Ng'wena told the youths that the delay was beyond their control.But Ng'wena told the group that the constituency will ensure they get paid as soon as possible.He added that those who participated in the demonstration will be dropped from the programme once they receive their money."Those who feel dissatisfied with this job will be paid in the evening so they can leave behind the patient ones who can wait for money from NYS," he said.Ng'wena blamed politicians for inciting a section of the cohorts to demonstrate and warned that action will be taken.He noted only 100 demonstrated yet there are about 1,000 cohorts int he county."We know some politicians took advantage of this situation and decided to incite some of the workers," he said.
