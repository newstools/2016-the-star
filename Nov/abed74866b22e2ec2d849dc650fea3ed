All the whining in the political sector about runaway corruption in both the national government and the counties is disgusting. Kenyans have rarely seen such copious crocodile tears shed by the political elite: This blame game is pointless to the point of cynicism. Particularly egregious is the bizarre division of labour in which Cord says graft in the national government is entirely a Jubilee headache, based merely on the fact of incumbency. Jubilee apologists point to corruption in the counties under the Cord governors as evidence of opposition hypocrisy. What must the inventors and developers of the Integrated Financial Management Information System think when they hear of the thieving uses it has been put to somewhere on the Equator? Ifmis is successfully used even by such a vast bureaucracy as the US Department of Homeland Security. The government must cease whining and take action against the corruption cartels it is fully empowered, manned and equipped to do so. End the blame game.
