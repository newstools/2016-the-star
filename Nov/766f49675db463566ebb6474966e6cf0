Norwegian Jonny Andersen, who was on July 12 picked to head Kenya Airports Authority, officially took office yesterday.Andersen is the immediate former director of National Airports at Avinor AS, a state-owned firm that manages airports in Norway, with responsibility for seven state-owned airport hubs. He was appointed after a competitive process following the sacking of Lucy Mbugua on June 26 last year. This is a pivotal time for KAA. Africa is rising; and the whole world is looking at it as the next frontier for growth, Andersen said. I look forward to harnessing this potential to build prosperity for the authority and the country as a whole. He said his primary target is to efficiently deliver safe and secure aviation services for the country into the future. At the centre of our work will be people, strategy and execution .Andersen replaces Nicholas Bodo who has been acting since July. Today, we open a new chapter and a fresh beginning for KAA. The management and board of KAA aims to deliver a world-class experience to airport users with zero tolerance to graft, KAA chairman Julius Karangi said.
