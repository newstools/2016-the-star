Cord has been barred from removing its errant MPs from parliamentary committees as a way of disciplining them.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi issued a temporary order stopping the de-whipping of the legislators perceived as rebels.Muturi said on Wednesday that the directive will remain until the House addresses issues surrounding the appropriate process of discharging an MP from a committee.The Speaker said there was, for instance, the need to put in place formal mechanisms for notification of the removal of members from committees."The issue of enforcing party discipline within the House through discharge of members from committees is a serious issue that requires conscious consideration by all," he said."I will not admit any further requests for the discharge of any member from a committee unless the whip of the party proposing the action demonstrates that the parliamentary party has given the affected member notice of his or her intended discharge."Parties intending to discharge members will also be required to give them an opportunity to be heard by an established panel before action is taken."In this regard, it is not for the Speaker to dictate who will neither constitute the panel nor its procedure, but suffice to say that some form of a hearing must have taken place," he said.ODM has been discharging rebel MPs from committees and replacing them with others as a way of punishing them.Some of the ODM legislators who were removed from committees for working with Jubilee include John Waluke (Sirisia), Stephen Kariuki (Mathare), Kubai Iringo (Iment Central) and Isaac Mwaura (Nominated).Read: MP Mwaura lashes out at Raila after name removed from party registerAlso read: Raila hits back at Mwaura over deregistration, calls ODM rebels prostitutesaAbabu Namwamba (Budalang'i) was also removed but he relaunched Labour Party of Kenya through which he intends to unite Luhyas.He noted that removing members without proper reasons, and denying them a right to fair administrative actions, was against constitutional provisions that allow MPs to participate fully in House activities.MPs assigned to committees mostly benefit from sitting allowances whenever they grill witnesses on various matters.Read: ODM rebels out of committeesAlso read: Expect fair judgement, panel tells ODM rebels
