Wrangles in the Jubilee Party in Nyandarua county over its leadership have escalated after aspirants elected 19 &ldquo;interim officials to champion our interests&rdquo;.The hopefuls elected the officials at a meeting at Father Baldo Catholic Conference Hall in Ol Kalou on Saturday.The aspirants&rsquo; forum convener Macharia Mukua said they took the move to ensure JP nominations in Nyandarua are free and fair, and that the incumbent leaders will not interfere with the primaries.Cyrus Kanyi from Ndaragwa was elected chairman, Macithi Macithi from Kipipiri secretary and Martin Kariuki from Ol Kalou treasurer. Dorcas Gachau will represent people living with disability.Mukua said the names of those picked during the Saturday meeting will be delivered to JP headquarters in a grand match next week on a date that is yet to be announced.This has brought to three the groups claiming leadership of JP in Nyandarua county. Elected leaders, led by Governor Daniel Waithaka and speaker Wahome Ndegwa, insist they are bona fide leaders of the party in Nyandarua, basing their stand on the positions they held in TNA, which had the biggest stake in the county.Another group led by the former Kanu chairman Nyandarua branch Kimani Gakenia has also claimed to be the legitimate interim office-bearers of JP in the county. They argue they were the officials of JP precursor, the Jubilee Alliance Party, and, therefore, they automatically deserved to be the new officials.The secretary of the Gakenia-led team Naphtali Muriithi, dismissed the move by the aspirants as futile. He said Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u on Thursday confirmed JP has structures and nobody can change that without due process.Speaking yesterday, Murithi said, &ldquo;If Mukua is not one of the officials whose names are with the Registrar, then what they are doing is futile. But they have the right to the freedom of association&rdquo;.But Mukua dismissed Muriithi&rsquo;s views as misguided. He said Gakenia&rsquo;s group should stop misleading the people of Nyandarua and aspirants will obviously react politically.
