Telkom Kenya has appointed former Safaricom's head of finance, planning and analysis Sundararaman Pattabiraman as its chief finance officer. This is part of the company's ongoing plans to strengthen its top management team following the takeover by UK private equity firm Helios in June. He brings on board more than 22 years of experience in Africa and Asia, 16 in the telecoms sector. Pattabiraman formerly worked as director of the board and chief financial officer at Essar Telecom Kenya &ndash; which exited in January 2015 &ndash; and was also a chief controller at Bharti Airtel."Pattabiraman has distinguished himself as an exceptional leader with a proven track record. He has strong knowledge of the Kenyan telecommunications market, and has broad experience as a market leader and challenger,&rdquo; Telkom Kenya CEO Aldo Mareuse said in a statement yesterday. For the fourth quarter ended June 2016, Telkom Kenya, under brand name Orange, increased its market share by 0.7 per cent to stand at 13.2 per cent, remaining in third place. The telco is controlled by Africa-focused Helios, a former strategic investor in Equity Bank, after acquiring the 70 per cent owned by France Telecom, but ceded 10 per cent to the state.
