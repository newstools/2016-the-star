Nairobi governor hopeful Esther Passaris will lead activists today in a demonstration to protest against the rising cases of sexual and gender based violence.The silent protest march seeks to create awareness on sexual and gender based violence and how to help survivors. The activists want the Gender and Interior ministries to do more to stop violence. The protest will start at Uhuru Park s Freedom Corner and end at Jevanjee Gardens, where they will conduct a rally.The protest is organised by the Nairobi City County and the Aids Healthcare Foundation.AHF project development manager Faith Ndung u expressed concern over the increased number of cases of violence despite laws and policies. Despite the progressive laws and policies currently in place, patriarchal attitudes and misogynist practices render laws and policies meaningless in the lives of many rape survivors. We want to change that, she said.Research indicates that in Kenya 14 per cent of women between 15-49 years old have experienced sexual and gender based violence and 11.5 per cent of women have experienced both physical and sexual based violence. In 2014, reports showed that 47 per cent of women have gone through either physical or sexual based violence, Ndung u said. She called for more of awareness and health and legal help for victims. The culture of silence is a great hindrance to tackling the problem, Ndung u said.
