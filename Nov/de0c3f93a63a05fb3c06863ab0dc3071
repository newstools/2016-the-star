ODM leader Raila Odinga deserves respect for his work as a political wizard, not criticism, Deputy President William Ruto has been told.ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire yesterday said calling Raila an economic saboteur is mischievous, irresponsible and disrespectful and aimed at demeaning his anti-corruption track record.Campaigning at the Coast last week, Ruto asked Raila to stop opposing development projects meant to improve lives, yet his family lives in comfort. Raila and his family use tap water, yet he is opposing water projects meant to quench the thirst of Kenyans. You tell us you are seeking leadership, yet you oppose development projects that are set to benefit poor Kenyans. Don t be cheated by this man, Ruto said at Werugha on Friday. Raila has opposed the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang a, and the Ndakaini and Itare dams, saying they are being hastily implemented without public participation, despite the catastrophic environmental damage they pose .Bosire said Ruto has launched an onslaught to discredit Raila, despite the opposition chief s claims of multibillion-shilling corruption at the NYS turning out to be true. Calling Raila an economic saboteur is failing to accept the gravity of corruption, the Kitutu Masaba MP said on the phone. Instead of Ruto apologising to Kenyans for massive corruption, he has decided to engage in propaganda.
