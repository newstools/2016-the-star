Two Kirinyaga MPs have urged Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua to join the Jubilee Party if she supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari, who has declared he will run for Kirinyaga governor, said Central is “purely” in JP. Announcing her bid for governor three weeks ago, Karua said she is okay with residents supporting Uhuru for President because that is their wish. Gitari said it is a fallacy that Karua says she supports Uhuru, yet she has been fighting him. ‘’We know Karua has been working with the opposition to fight Uhuru. If she has changed her mind and decided to support him, let her join the Jubilee Party and face us in the primaries,’’ he said. Gichugu MP Njogu Barua said Karua should join the Jubilee Party if she “seriously supports Uhuru”. Speaking at Kianyaga in Giochugu constituency on Friday, he said Kirinyaga voters will only elect JP candidates. Barua urged Karua to face off with other aspirants during primaries.
