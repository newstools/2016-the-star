Apart from minor instances, last week s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams went very well and the governments needs to ensure the integrity of the marking. The KCSE exams are important for both students and parents as they mark the transition to tertiary education. It is therefore vital that examination invigilation be closely monitored to ensure that school heads and teachers do not collude with supervisors and invigilators to leak the exams. Security needs to be enhanced in all exam centres. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that all the officials involved observe all the procedures that are set to maintain the integrity of our public examinations. This is a matter of the greatest public.
