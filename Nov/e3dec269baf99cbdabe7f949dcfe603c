In form striker Michael Olunga, fresh from scoring another brace for his Swedish outfit Djurgadens, is also in the squad as is the Zesco trio of David Owino, Jesse Were and Teddy Akumu.The two friendlies will provide another opportunity for Were to break his scoring duck for the national team as he has struggled to cope at the international stage despite his prowess in front of goal for his club Zesco at the domestic and continental front.His goals spurred the Zambian champions to an unlikely semi-final run of the CAF Champions League, which was eventually won by South African side, Mamelodi Sundowns.That has been no problem at all fro Olunga, who has taken his prepared instincts to Sweden, where his contribution of 12 goals helped his side to finish 7th in the Swedish top flight.Olunga was just five goals shy of Nigerian John Owoeri, who won the Golden Boot. Also called up is IFK Marrienham s Amos Ekhalie, another player whose side shone in the domestic front as they won the Finnish top division league. Aboud Omar of Slavia Sofia in Bulgaria, David Ochieng Cheche (New York Cosmos), South Africa-based duo of Brian Mandela (Maritzburg) and Clifton Miheso (Golden Arrows) as well as Ismael Gonzales of high-flying Spanish side LS Palmas are also in the team.
