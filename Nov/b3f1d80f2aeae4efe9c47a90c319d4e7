Thousands of residents of Kitui East subcounty will benefit from reliable water supply with the construction of 20 sand dams and wells.The Italian government and the EU have funded the project for Sh20 million to end perennial water scarcity.It was implemented by the European Committee for Training and Agriculture in partnership with Kitui s Sahelian Solutions Foundation, and coordinated by the National Drought Management Authority.Speaking on Wednesday at the Makulunga dam site during handover of the project to the community, Sasol CEO Mutinda Munguti said more than 10,000 people and 20,000 heads of cattle will directly benefit.He said the project also covered construction of pit latrines and concrete troughs for watering animals in all the 20 dam sites.
