More than 50 resolutions out of hundreds passed by the 11th Parliament have been implemented by the Executive.National Assembly Committee on Implementation chairperson Soipan Tuya said the enforcement of the resolutions &mdash; committee reports, legislation and petitions from MPs and the public &mdash; means the House is no longer a &ldquo;talk shop&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our duty is to ensure the Executive acts on the resolutions of the House for the good of the people,&rdquo; The Narok woman representative said in the committee&rsquo;s progress report. The committee&rsquo;s key role, according to the standing orders, is to follow up on the implementation status of the resolutions adopted by the House so it can update members. &ldquo;These resolutions trigger the Executive to act,&rdquo; Tuya (pictured) said.The resolutions acted on include the Sh600 million allocation in this year&rsquo;s budget for hiring police reservists in arid and semi- arid lands such as Turkana and West Pokot. The allocation will help review the terms and conditions for the KPR officers, who play a key complimentary role to the mainstream security system.The committee has ensured Sh80 million was allocated for livestock insurance policy in 2014-15, Sh300 million for 2015-16 and Sh500 million for the current financial year. In January, payouts were made in Wajir to 275 farmers from Diff and Butte divisions. They benefitted to the tune of Sh3.5 million. The current budget allows zero- rating of animal feeds to enable farmers enjoy higher returns on their investments.
