Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko have reached an understanding on promoting peaceful campaigns ahead of the 2017 general election.Sonko said on his Facebook page they will use #SiasaSiUadui to do so, following the agreement they reached over lunch at Intercontinental Hotel in Nairobi on Tuesday."Politics is not enmity," he wrote on Tuesday.An August poll by the Radio Africa Group research team found the two were running neck and neck in the race for governor.Kidero is the presumptive Cord candidate for the post but has not yet been formally endorsed and no-one else has indicated that they will challenge him for the nomination.It might be a challenge for Sonko to turn his undoubted personal popularity into a winning vote if he was not endorsed by Jubilee or Cord.Read more: Sonko, Kidero lead race for NairobiThe Senator said they also agreed on several other issues concerning the county, including road networks, during the meeting of governors, senators and all roads department heads.Kenyans on Twitter responded via hash tag #KideroSonkoLunch, most saying Kidero and Sonko should meet more often to end their wrangles."This is the kind of political maturity we want to see for the sake of the people," said Nyambura wa Anthony.Ashok David Dave said: "If it means meeting daily, as long as Nairobi remains the agenda, then I fully support [sic]."But others dismissed the lunch saying it was part of a actical game commonly played by politicians."Enmity was left with the poor.
