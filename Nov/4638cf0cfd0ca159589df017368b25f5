Four suspected members of a criminal gang in Busia&rsquo;s Marachi estate were charged on Monday in a Busia court with attacking police with stones and clubs. Patrick Ngesa, Michael Otieno, William Ogutu and Samuel Oloo were arrested on Thursday last week. They appeared before resident magistrate Christabela Ogutu. They are alleged to have blocked the officers who were chasing a lorry transporting contraband sugar from a neighbouring country. They denied the charges. The illegal gang, the Marachi Republican Council, has been terrorising residents. Samuel Oloo and William Ogutu were released on Sh10,000 bond each, while Patrick Ngesa and Michael Otieno were remanded after failing to raise Sh50,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on December 1.
