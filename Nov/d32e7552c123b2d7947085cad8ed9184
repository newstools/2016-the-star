Governor Evans Kidero has ordered the refilling of a trench dug by the Kenya Defence Force officers, blocking a road connecting Mihango and Kayole estates.He gave the orders on Thursday to Transport chief officer Michael Ngari. This follows a successful court petition by the county to have the road reopened.Soldiers from Embakasi Garrison last month dug the trench, blocking the road that cuts through the barracks. The decision sparked protests by leaders and residents, leading to the arrest of Mihango MCA Paul Kados. The case is still in court. On Thursday, judge George Odunga approved the county s application to fill the trenches so residents can use the road. In the premises, I direct that the applicant be at liberty to fill the trenches in question to the extent that the public are afforded access through the said road, pending hearing and determination of these proceedings or other orders of this court, he said.
