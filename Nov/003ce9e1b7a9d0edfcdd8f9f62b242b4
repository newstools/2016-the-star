The much awaited concert of the year, Yetu Festival, finally went down on Saturday at the Ngong Racecourse Waterfront.Being the first of it's kind, many would have thought twice about attending but the minute they set their eyes on the grounds, their hearts were automatically content.The Festival was definitely a unique festival as it celebrated Kenya&rsquo;s diversity, love of life and culture while reminding us why we love this country this much.The turn up was amazing as people settled down in small groups chatting and enjoying the day before the performances started.DJ Kym.With some of the best artistes in the country, whom most of us have grown up listening to, the crowd couldn't get enough of the performances as they sang along to each song.Even the gospel lovers were not left behind as Esther Wahome curtain raised the event with her melodious voice.Esther Wahome.Kidum has never disappointed when it comes to doing live music. He is truly a darling to many and the crowd pleaded with him to do one more song after his time was up and as always you gotta give the crowd what it wants.Them Mushrooms brought back beautiful memories with their jams. The 90's kids were pretty much lost when they hit the stage as many are not familiar with them but they enjoyed the music nonetheless.Them Mushrooms.Nameless, Wyre, Fena and Amos &amp; Josh wowed the crowd as many are familiar with their songs and let's not forget Nyashinski who performed with his former mates Roba and Collo.It was a beautiful night filled with love, laughter and peace.
