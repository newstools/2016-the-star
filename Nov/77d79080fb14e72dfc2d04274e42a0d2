Others are former deputy registrar Kaikai Kissinger, Martin Okwata, Benedict Omollo, Nicholas Okwemwa, Nicholas Mbeba, Thomas Atak and Wycliff Obunde.They are accused of violating procurement laws when they awarded the contracts worth Sh150 million.Shollei and her seven co-accused are alleged to have increased the advance down payment for construction of court buildings from 10 per cent to 50 per cent without the approval of the tender committee. They allegedly committed the offence on January 17, 2013, while serving in the judiciary.The prosecution alleges that the accused used their offices to improperly confer a benefit on Timsales Ltd by awarding the tender for construction of the Runyenjes court building.
