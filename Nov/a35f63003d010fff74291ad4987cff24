New Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday said he will ensure collegiality and efficiency in the Supreme Court, which previouly has been split into factions. The issues of the past bench are behind us. We have held a week-long retreat and there shouldn t be any differences, he said yesterday.Maraga spoke during the court s first session in five months. Present were Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu and Supreme Court judges Mohamed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, Jacktone Ojwang and Njoki Ndung u. Justice Isaac Lenaola was absent in Geneva, Switzerland.Senior counsels Busia Senator Amos Wako, Fred Ojiambo, Tom Ojienda, Paul Muite, Joyce Majiwa and Ahmednasir Abdulahi were present.Maraga praised his predecessor Willy Mutunga for being a pioneer and reformer. He said the apex court will hold a stakeholders meeting once a year. Maraga said the court will clear the backlog of 169 pending cases in the shortest time possible. The backlog at the Supreme Court is at an unacceptable level. Counsels with the cases should approach the court so we can clear them, he said. Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko said Maraga s, Mwilu s and Lenaola s experience will enrich the bench. As custodian of the Constitution, we expect you to do your job. This includes checking excesses in the executive, legislature and other constitutional bodies with neutrality and independence, he said.The DPP said his office will cooperate with the court as it has with other lower courts. Law Society of Kenya chairman Isaac Okero said there is relief now that the court is fully constituted. It can now deliver justice to Kenyans. It is important that the court maintains its collegiality, he said.
