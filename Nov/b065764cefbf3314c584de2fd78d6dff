The Court of Appeal in Mombasa has allowed the government to continue constructing the Sh327 billion standard gauge railway, four months after the High Court in Mombasa suspended the project.This was after Kenya Railways, which is overseeing construction, won an appeal against stay orders.Part of the SGR construction had been suspended after judge Anne Omollo issued an order of stay against the Kenya Railways and China Road Construction Company. Earlier, two companies had moved to court, claiming the government had failed to compensate them for encroaching on their land to build the track. African Gas Oil and Company Ltd and Miritini Free Port were seeking payment for land where part of the line was being built. They said the government through the National Land Commission was required to pay them Sh519 million in compensation. Justice Omollo then ordered the government to compensate the two companies an estimated Sh2 billion before the project could proceed, and the orders would remain in force until payment was made. However, KR argued the stay order was causing massive daily losses of Sh37,600,000 .
