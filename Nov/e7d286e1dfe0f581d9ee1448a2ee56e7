ODM will charge women aspirants lower nomination fees compared to their male counterparts to encourage most of them to participate in the 2017 polls.This is part of an overhaul of the parties' nomination rules that is viewed to set stage for meeting the required two-thirds gender parity.Chairman John Mbadi said the plan will give the women a fair advantage to win seats for governor, member of parliament as well as county assemblies. ODM women aspirants have been paying nomination fees at the same rate as the men, a situation that locked most of them out."The plan of ODM is to provide the required space to ensure that majority of our women are elected to parliament and county assemblies," Mbadi told the Star.

Previous attempts to have the issue of gender imbalances addressed through a legal mechanism in parliament failed."We are also planning on constructing our party list based on the Zebra principle- where the name of a man will appear after that of a woman on the list that we will present to the electoral commission in the 12 nomination slots," Mbadi said. "The idea of starting with a woman's name is meant to push for maximum numbers of women in parliament- if a party was to get one slot, that slot will go to a woman," the MP said. The constitution provides that not more than a third of elective or appointive positions in public institutions should be of the same gender. In complying with the rule, the legislative proposal by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale sought to have more women nominated to fill the slots.But debate on the matter failed in the wake of a quorum hitch. All the same, it has been viewed that the nomination of extra female MPs on top of the current 349 MPs will increase the country's wage bill.
