A Nakuru electrician has pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder after stabbing a magistrate and a complainant.Michael Kahoro stabbed magistrate Eunice Kelly, his accuser Edith Adhiambo after he was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday, in an assault case.He pleaded guilty to attempting to kill Kelly and Adhiambo when he appeared before chief magistrate Josephat Burudi on Wednesday.Kahoro's charge sheet says he stabbed Kelly six times in the hand, and Adhiambo six times in the neck.The man also accepted a charge of injuring court orderly constable Wanjiru Ngugi by dislocating her right index finger.Kahoro denied three other counts of obstructing Kelly, Wanjiru and a court interpreter.But he asked the court to forgive him as his intentions were not ill.The electrician told the court he picked the screw driver he used in the court's cloakrooms, thinking he would need it for work."I did not come from home with the screw driver. I had no intention of harming the magistrate and the complainant," said Kahoro.He added in his plea for release on bond that he was an orphan and that his family depended entirely on him.The prosecution objected to his release saying he was serving a different sentence.The magistrate declined his application saying Kelly had sentenced him.Burudi said the facts of the attempted murder cases will be read to him on Friday and a hearing date set for the obstruction case.Kahoro appeared in court on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting Adhiambo on unknown dates in 2014.The man who had been released on bond reported to court for a ruling.Rift Vallley Law Society of Kenya chairman Frank Mwangi condemned the incident and called for tighter security in courtrooms.He said they will not be intimidated but noted that courtrooms are small and orderlies few, putting magistrates, clerks, advocates and orderlies at risk.
