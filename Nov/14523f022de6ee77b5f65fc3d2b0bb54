South African David Rajuli prevented a Kenyan clean sweep as he defeated his host Michael &lsquo;Shaka&rsquo; Nyawade on unanimous decision.Meanwhile, a war of words has erupted between the events organiser, &ldquo;Bigger than Life Promotions&rdquo; and Bernard Adie&rsquo;s coach Julius Odhiambo who wants the pugilist to be paid his full purse despite the cancellation of his fight. This is first against Marcellus Brown and again against former heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman.Adie was allegedly paid Sh30,000 compensation but Odhiambo insists he should be paid the full amount of Sh150,000 &ldquo;as per the contract.&rdquo;Odhiambo has even threatened to approach the United States Embassy if the pugilist is not paid the full amount.&ldquo;They have called me for a meeting but I will not attend. I am ready to fight hard on this one. I will present all this to the American Embassy if they don&rsquo;t pay my boxer,&rdquo; said Odhiambo.However, Kenya Professional Boxing Commission secretary Frankline Imbenzi insisted: &ldquo;There was no clause in the contract stating Adie will be paid the full amount in case the fight did not go on.&rdquo;
