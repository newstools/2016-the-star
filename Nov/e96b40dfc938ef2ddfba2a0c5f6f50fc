Two Kakamega MCAs and a resident want the court to block the construction of a plant to extract gold at the Rosterman mines in Kakamega.The three argue that the said installation by a Tanzanian firm poses grave environmental dangers to the area residents following the use of Sodium Cyanide in one of the processes.Mahiakalo rep Cleophas Malala, Alex Khamasi (nominated) and Jeremiah Wabuti were granted leave to sue the company on behalf of residents.They have named Kakamega county government, Ajabu E.A and Isindu Shihundandi as respondents in the suit.The case will be heard on November 15, 2016 before senior resident magistrate J. Ong ondo.They sought orders stopping Ajabu E.A from continuing with construction of the plant, excavation and dumping excavated material on the land bordering the River Isiukhu pending hearing and determination of the suit.Ajabu was also barred from using waters from the said river for discharge of affluent from the plant.Khamasi, who chairs the county assembly environment and water committee, said they will summon the firm's directors to explain why they are operating the equipment without approval."We have realised that the company did not carry out environmental impact assessment before commencing their activities," Khamasi said.The company is to excavate gold dust from a parcel of land in the area and move the minerals to a nearby plant it is putting up on the banks of river Isiukhu.
