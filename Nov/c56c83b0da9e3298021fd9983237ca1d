Siaya county assembly speaker George Okode has been touted as the best candidate for senator as James Orengo goes for the governor race. Okode stands a chance for the position if he decides to vie. He will only face nominated MCA Margaret Okotch, who has declared her interest. Currently, only one person has publically announced their interest in the Siaya Senate seat. Oburu Oginga will run for the Bondo parliamentary seat. Critics say Okode is the best to replace Orengo, owing to the vast experience in his oversight role as speaker. Okode enjoys a good relationship with Siaya politicians and may win if he decides to run. During the Siaya by-election period when the High Court in Kisumu nullified Governor Cornell Rasangaâ€™s victory, Okode acted as governor for more than three months.
