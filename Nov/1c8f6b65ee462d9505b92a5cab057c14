PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo gave NYS suspect Josephine Kabura a scolding as MPs frustrated by her lack of proper explanations turned to Bible verses.Kabura appeared before the Public Accounts Committee to give answers on the Sh791 million NYS fraud, but she took long pauses, gave short answers and dodged some questions."We gave you a chance to redeem yourself. You swindled the people of Kenya and those who benefited from it you have chosen to protect. It is very unfortunate," said Gumbo.The Rarieda MP had asked Kabura how she made payments of Sh52 million without receipts. The question of tax returns also arose; the businesswoman said she was in the process of filing them."You can not tell me you are paying people millions of money and you do not even remember them. You do not even have evidence," noted Gumbo.He further attacked Kabura's lawyer asking him what he was doing in the meeting if his client could not open up about what she was being asked."You have come here with your lawyer who has come to defend you instead of issuing legal advice on this case," he told Kabura. "Citizens of this country gave your companies over Sh1.6 billion and you have no receipts."Read: 'Hostile' Josephine Kabura admits giving Kago Sh60m without securityGumbo asked the Nairobi businesswoman to stop playing hide and seek, noting she had been taking them "through a charade since 9am""You have made public statements that contradict what you are telling us.
