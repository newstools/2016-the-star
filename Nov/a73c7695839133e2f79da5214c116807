Police dispersed the two groups. Later the group carrying a casket went to regroup at the Kilifi bus termini and blocked the road by burning tyres and the casket.This follows several social media debates on the corruption allegations in Kilifi county and the national government. Residents who support ODM have been pointing fingers at Jubilee adherents for condemning the alleged loss of money from the Kilifi government accounts.
