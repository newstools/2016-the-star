 I
have occasionally had the opportunity to give a lecture on foreign aid to an
audience at some Western European or North American college campus. And
my favourite case study at such events is that of the establishment of the
Kenya Utalii College in the early 70s, through assistance from the Swiss
government. To
understand why this is an example of real significance, you first have to ask
yourself: What kind of economy did the “Kenya Colony” of our pre-Independence
years have? And the answer of course is that it was an economy designed very
specifically for the benefit of a few thousand large-scale farmers, of the
class that used to be referred to as “white settlers”. These
settlers were also supported by a mostly white Civil Service. Within
this grand design, the Kenyan Asian community was the “dukawallah” class of
small-scale traders and shopkeepers (and there were active steps taken to
discourage them from entering the professions). And the “indigenous tribes”
were designated as providers of manual labour (and, as such, their
opportunities for advancement were even more limited than that of the Asian
community in colonial Kenya). In
short, the opportunities for education and training were largely structured to
perpetuate this system of economic apartheid, with a rigidly enforced “colour
bar” also added to keep the Asians, as well as the indigenous communities, in
their place. This
is why when Kenya got its Independence, and many of the white civil servants
opted to return to the UK, there was such a huge skills gap in the nation that
we were only saved from collapse by short-term schemes like the famous “students
airlift” project that sent thousands of promising young Kenyans to the US for
college education. Two
of the Kenyans with greatest global fame – the late Professor Wangari Maathai
and the late Barack Obama Senior – were beneficiaries of this scheme. But
filling in these vacancies in various professions created by the departure of
British technocrats was actually the easier part of it. Expanding the economy
beyond its earlier colonial focus on cash crops was not so easy. And this is
where the Swiss came in. Kenya’s
potential as a tourist destination had actually been noted long before Independence.
But it was noted in the lazy casual manner of colonial governors who did not
feel burdened to create economic opportunity for the “natives”. However,
a popularly elected African government had to approach the whole thing
differently. Jobs had to be created for the growing population of educated
Kenyans, who would certainly not be content to “return to the land” as
small-scale farmers after years spent in a modern classroom. Their definition
of economic opportunity was tied to paid employment, rather than rudimentary,
backbreaking farming. Tourism
offered an immediate solution, as Kenya already had potential investors in this
sector – Americans and Europeans who were keen to extend their well-established
hotel chains into the newly independent country. And
that is where the need for what we now refer to as “capacity building” came in. The
building and management of the hotels and lodges that constitute “the
hospitality sector” may well be best left to private investors, then as now.
But in tourism, as in other sectors, a certain surplus of skilled manpower is
needed if you are to compete effectively in a global market. A lower income
Kenyan setting out for a quick matatu trip to Nyeri who stops by for a cup of
tea in the River Road area, may well be satisfied with the service at one of
the many small restaurants in that area. But a middle-class Kenyan on a holiday
at the Coast expects something very different at the beach hotel his family may
be staying at. Well,
back in the 1960s, we had many Kenyans who could serve as waiters at the first
type of establishment. But relatively few who could work efficiently at a
100-bedroom beach resort or city five-star hotel like the gleaming new Nairobi
Intercontinental or the Nairobi Hilton (famously “the tallest building in East
Africa” when it was first opened). Utalii
College was the inspired solution to this problem of creating local skilled
manpower for the hospitality sector. And in its early years (ie the 1970s)
admission into Utalii College’s hotel management course was only slightly less
difficult than admission to the ultra-prestigious University of Nairobi (back
then the only university in the country). There
are four other significant things to be noted about Utalii College: First that
it did not only train Kenyans, but also students from neighbouring countries,
thus extending the benefits of this training in hospitality at various levels
to the entire East African region. At to this day – as far as I am aware – it
remains the leading regional training institution for the hospitality sector. Second
is that even if the Swiss had never after that participated in any other
“development project” here in Kenya beyond Utalii College, this one project
alone would have put us deeply in their debt. For this was a truly
transformational project: It allowed a newly independent nation to open up an
entire new field of economic opportunity for its youth, and move it from the
“cottage industry” scale that existed until the 1960s, to a fully “industrial
strength” globally competitive economic sector. Third
is that the evidence of the real extent of the success of Kenya’s tourism
sector is in the fact that whereas back in the 1970s virtually all top hotel
management within Kenya was dominated by Swiss and German managers, we now find
that in many neighbouring countries (Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda) the top hotel
management cadres are very often dominated by Kenyans. And
finally, although there is a half-baked attempt, mired in corruption, to set up
a new Utalii College campus at the Coast, sponsored by the government, the
private sector is already well ahead in this matter of offering training for
the hospitality sector. On weekends in particular, you can barely turn a page
in the local newspapers without seeing an advertisement for this or that
“college of hospitality”, some of which may well provide training of dubious
quality, but a good number of which are, in their own right, centres of
excellence. In
short, what Kenya needed from the Swiss – the preeminent benchmark of
excellence in the global hospitality sector – was not that they should hold our
hand indefinitely. But rather that they should provide us with the capacity building
infrastructure that would serve as a catalyst for our own efforts in that
sector. That
is what the best of “foreign aid” projects do. And Utalii College also disproves
the frequent allegation of aid critics, that foreign aid serves to “cultivate
dependency” in the recipient nation, and to “hold us back” from ever competing
with the nations who give us aid. Think
of all those many Swiss hotel managers of the 1980s, employed on the most
enviable expatriate terms (free education for the kids; two nice cars,
including an SUV for weekend travel; a baronial home with a swimming pool) who
then had to return to Switzerland when Kenyans who had trained at the
Swiss-supported Utalii College turned up to take their jobs (at much lower
salaries and dwellings, of course). Where
is the dependency in that? How can we possibly claim that the Swiss helped set
up Utalii College, and graciously shared their hospitality expertise with us
over the years, in order to “hold us back”? It
is from such a perspective, then, that we should weigh the recent decision of The
Netherlands government to slowly phase out their generous aid programmes to
Kenya by the year 2020. The
Dutch government is merely responding rationally to the fact that Kenya is no
longer as poor as it once was. And this should be cause for pride, not anger
out of a feeling that “we are being denied aid which helped the poorest of the
poor”. Our
government can actually do a lot to help those seriously poor Kenyans: And the
county governments under devolution have been empowered to do even more. In
concluding, I should mention that, about two years ago, I attended a conference
in Tokyo which was both celebrating and assessing 60 years of Japanese Overseas
Development Assistance. I was rather surprised to learn that prior to 1954
Japan had actually been a net recipient of just such ODA. But it was explained
that Japan – a fairly prosperous nation in the early part of the 20th
century – had seen its industrial base totally decimated by carpet-bombing,
during the Second World War, and its hardworking population reduced to utter
destitution. And
yet within the decade beginning from the end of that war, Japan moved from
receiving aid to being able to contribute to the assistance of poorer nations. We
in Kenya know very well what the benefits of Japanese aid have been: From
brand-new institutions built from scratch, like the Kenya Medical Research
Institute and the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology; to
the iconic series of ultra-modern bridges at the Coast (the Nyali Bridge,
Mtwapa Bridge, Kilifi Bridge, Sabaki Bridge) which played an indispensable part
in opening up the region to tourism. All
these are examples of human or infrastructural capacity building that was provided
by a friendly nation, at a time when we could not hope to carry the burden of
creating them by ourselves. But
this does not mean that we will always be this helpless: With time, there is no
reason why Kenya should not be prosperous enough to tackle all its development
needs from its own tax collections. Indeed, we are almost there, with the Kenya
Revenue Authority regularly reminding us that 97 per cent of our annual Budget
is met from internal tax collections. It
is only fair then that the “donor nations” increasingly turn their attention to
our poorer neighbours, some of whom rely on such donors for up to 30 per cent
of their annual budgetary needs.
