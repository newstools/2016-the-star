All-round young driver Ryan Bailey signed off from Bambino Class in awesome fashion as the season-closing RSC National Autocross Championship event ended in Kajiado County on Sunday.The son of legendary rally driver Paul Bailey and retired navigator Gillian, completed a scintillating hat-trick of Bambino Class titles after beating his Hillcrest schoolmate Sean Smith by a mere 10 seconds in the ninth and final round.Such was the adrenaline that punctuated the Rallye Sports Club round which was graced by the Club and KMSF Chairman Phineas Kimathi at Champagne Park racetrack in Kipeto over the weekend. Prior to the season finale, Ryan enjoyed a slim four points cushion from Sean but savoured his third career Bambino accolade upon completing his best three heat runs in 10.35.59minutes.&ldquo;This was one of the most enjoyable races of my career. Up till the last race, we were separated by four points and I&rsquo;m glad that I won the championship for the umpteenth time. Sadly, this was my last race in Bambino as I will be driving an Attacker Buggy next season. I wish to salute Sean for putting up a good fight throughout the season,&rdquo; said Ryan.Ryan, who is turning 15 in December and the Smith siblings (Sean and Rio), will be moving up to the junior category in 2017 and are expected to take the battle to Daewoo&rsquo;s Rajveer Thethy, who was one of the fastest young autocross drivers in the season. The junior category promises some hair-raising thrills from second generation young drivers, who are hoping to follow in the footsteps of their patents in the &ldquo;man vs machine&rdquo; game. Sean and Rio are siblings of the reigning African rally champion Don Smith while Rajveer is son of former 2WD Champion Charan Thethy .
