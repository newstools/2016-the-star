The Kenya Bureau of Standards has denied claims that it is paying a monthly fee of Sh4.5 billion to a Swiss company, in a contract said to be a duplication of role. Managing director Charles Ongwae yesterday said such a contract does not exist. He said Kebs, a state-run agency responsible for the adoption and application of standards for both imported and domestically manufactured products, is functionally incapable of raising the amount mentioned, let alone pay a single firm . Ongwae said Kebs operates a Pre-shipment Verification of Conformity programme to protect Kenyans from substandard goods, and has contracted Chinese firm SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek, China Certification and Quality Inspection Services a Japanese motor vehicle inspection firm to assess standards. These are international companies of repute . Their contracts end in January 2018 for the three import inspection companies, and 2018 March for QISJ, Ongwae said. The inspection fee is paid directly by importers to these companies, and Kebs gets 27 per cent in royalties.
