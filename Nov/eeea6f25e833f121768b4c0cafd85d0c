The Kenya Bureau of Standards has denied claims that it is paying a monthly fee of Sh4.5 billion to a Swiss company, in a contract said to be a duplication of role. Managing director Charles Ongwae yesterday said such a contract does not exist. He said Kebs, a state-run agency responsible for the adoption and application of standards for both imported and domestically manufactured products, &ldquo;is functionally incapable of raising the amount mentioned, let alone pay a single firm&rdquo;. Ongwae said Kebs operates a Pre-shipment Verification of Conformity programme to protect Kenyans from substandard goods, and has contracted Chinese firm SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek, China Certification and Quality Inspection Services &ndash; a Japanese motor vehicle inspection firm &ndash; to assess standards. &ldquo;These are international companies of repute . Their contracts end in January 2018 for the three import inspection companies, and 2018 March for QISJ,&rdquo; Ongwae said. The inspection fee is paid directly by importers to these companies, and Kebs gets 27 per cent in royalties.
