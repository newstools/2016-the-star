Rashid accused Oparanya of neglecting the people of Mumias, despite the large number of votes he garnered from the Wanga community. &ldquo;Why should it take you two days to move from Kakamega to Mumias, less than 30km, when your people were being oppressed by security agents?&rdquo; Rashid asked Oparanya.Oparanya tried to address the crowd but he was jeered by the youths who said he didn&rsquo;g care about them. Washiali asked why the ODM leadership was fighting for the fall of Mumias Sugar Company so people of Mumias can remain in abject poverty. &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t Raila come here with Kidero to say sorry to the people of Mumias? Why did Oparanya give Sh200 million to a businessman in the name of granting Mumias Sugar Company?&rdquo; asked Washiali. He accused Oparanya of double-speak against the people of Mumias and taking them for granted.&ldquo;But 2017 is not far. We shall tell these people what your intentions are for them,&rdquo; he said. Washiali and Rashid are Jubilee kingpins in Kakamega county. Raila called Rashid aside where they talked briefly before he went to his vehicle. It was damaged after youths threw stones at the windscreen. Then Raila was driven off for an ODM function in Kakamega.
