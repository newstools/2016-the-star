Governor Evans Kidero has said he is ready to change his name to Kariuki if that would make city residents reelect him. He urged residents to shun tribal politics and base votes on track records.&ldquo;I know my name may betray me, but I am ready to change it to Kariuki if that is what will make you vote for me,&rdquo; Kidero said. He spoke when he toured the construction site of a Sh6.5 billion, eight- kilometre road running from Ngara through Gikomba Market to Landhies Road. The road is sponsored by the World Bank and will be completed in a year.Last week, Jubilee MCAs urged former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth to run for Nairobi governor and pledged their support. They had also endorsed Water CS Eugene Wamalwa. Ngara MCA Mwaura Chege and Umoja 1&rsquo;s George Maina urged residents to reelect Kidero.
