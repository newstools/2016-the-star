Wiper and Ford Kenya will soon deal with MPs who publicly defected to the Jubilee Party last month.Wiper chairman David Musila yesterday said the party s disciplinary committee has been instructed to hear the matter and report to the National Executive Committee immediately. The committee has already been directed by the NEC to deal with the issue. The media will be kept informed of any developments, he said. The decision by the two Cord parties comes just a day after their coalition partner, ODM, recommended the expulsion of some of its MPs from the party, following the recommendations of its disciplinary committee that was chaired by Fred Athuok. Ford Kenya secretary general Eseli Simiyu (pictured) said the party s National Executive Committee will meet this week to deliberate on the formation of the disciplinary committee to investigate the conduct of rebel members, among them MCAs. We will not be left behind in ensuring discipline within political parties is maintained through fidelity to the rule of law. The letters summoning those who defected are ready and will be sent to them once the disciplinary committee is formed before the end of the week, he said. Those expected to be summoned by Wiper include Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Munuve Mati (Mwingi North), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. Those to be summoned by Ford Kenya include Turkana Senator Joseph Munyes, MP Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and Nicholas Ngikor (Turkana East).
