I hope our boys get competitive fixtures as we prepare for the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR) 1A fixtures,&rdquo; he said.Kenya have played two friendlies this year, beating Brazil 18-17 at their own backyard and hammering Hong Kong twice in Nairobi 34-10 and 24-18 away.Kenya also registered wins over Zimbabwe 61-15 in Harare and thrashed Uganda 45-24 in the CAR 1A Championship and went on to reclaim the Elgon Cup,&rdquo; Mango said.He said it has been relatively good year for the team but urged the players to strive and win the Africa Cup next and move into the top 20 of ranking.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good year for Kenya 15s as we managed to expose a few young players to top class rugby. We also achieved our highest ranking ever but for the 2017, it will be even tougher as we aim to move up the ranking to be in the top 20. Africa Cup which has eluded us for the past four year&rsquo;s is our next target,&rdquo; added MangoKenya are currently ranked 22 in the latest world rugby ranking.
