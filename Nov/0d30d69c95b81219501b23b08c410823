Mt Elgon leaders have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to resolve the land problem during his tour of Bungoma county. Businessman Peter Sirai yesterday said Uhuru should extend his visit to the subcounty. The President will visit the county on Friday. Sirai said Uhuru has avoided Mt Elgon during his previous visits. &ldquo;We have so many issues we want addressed, including the issuance of title deeds to Chepyuk squatters,&rdquo; he said. Uhuru will attend the fi rst graduation ceremony at Kibabii University. He awarded it a charter in November last year. He will also reopen the Webuye Pan-Paper Mills. Speaking to the star on the phone, Sirai, who is a Mt Elgon MP aspirant, said the problem has dragged for a long time and the squatters are frustrated. &ldquo;We want the issue solved so farmers can access credit facilities,&rdquo; he said.
