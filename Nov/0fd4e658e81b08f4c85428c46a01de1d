Four MPs are among candidates writing the ongoing KCSE tests at private examination centres in the North Rift.The MPs, from various parts of the country, are sitting their exams in centres located within Uasin Gishu and Baringo counties.Benjamin Cheboi, director Acacia Adult Education School, said the MPs, whom he did not name, had been registered as adult learners.However, the Star established that two of the MPs are from Baringo with two others from Uasin Gishu and Bungoma respectively.Cheboi could not explain if the MPs were writing the exams for the first time or are re-sitting the said papers."We registered a total of 25 candidates under the adult education programme among them four MPs," Cheboi said.He said the legislators had requested to privately sit for the exams and that those from Baringo had been allowed to write the tests in Uasin Gishu."Two others were moved to Baringo for purposes of privacy and to avoid interference," Cheboi said."The private centers are away from other secondary schools where the ordinary KCSE candidates are sitting for their exams," he said. Cheboi said he could not reveal the MP's names owing to their status, and instead asked journalists to use their sources to know who the leaders are."Eventually they will be known at the time the results are released but at the moment you can find out using your own means," he told the Star.The adult learner's institution also registered a 47 year-old mother at a private centre in Eldoret. One inmate will write the national exams at the Eldoret GK prison.Twenty secondary schools in Kerio Valley have been placed under tight security following rampant banditry attacks in the region.MCAs in the area led by Thomas Kigen of Kaptarakwa ward asked the government to put more measures in place towards restoration of security in the region.Read: Security tightened as KCSE kicks off with record number of candidates
