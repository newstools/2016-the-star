A nurse yesterday accused police of torturing him 16 days on suspicion he treated al Shabaab fighters in Mbwajumwali, Lamu East subcounty.Omar Faraj, 38, said he was arrested after police raided his house in Witu, Lamu West subcounty, after the Mpeketoni terror attack in which more than 100 people were killed.Faraj, now based at King Fahd on the Lamu Island, said 12 officers raided his house on July 27, 2014 at 9.06pm. He said they hit him in the mouth and beat with a gun butt. &ldquo;The police denied me a chance to go to hospital after they injured my mouth and almost broke my arm with a gun butt. I released on August 12, 2014 after I read a verse in the Quran and sought divine intervention. The tiny smelly cell had bedbugs and lice and held 41 other suspects,&rdquo; he said.Faraj said police arrested him for allegedly being a doctor for al Shabaab at his then work station at Mbwajumwali dispensary in Lamu East subcounty.He said he was held for 16 days, three of which he was taken to an unknown place while blind-folded.Faraj said he was later released without being charged.He made a presentation to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights public inquiry on security at Lamu Fort.The session was attended by among others, KNCHR chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori, Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri and Independent Police Oversight Authority board member Vincent Kiptoo.The commission began its two-day sitting on Lamu Island yesterday. It will wind up its Coast inquiries in Mpeketoni next Friday.He said police also slapped his wife and took Sh2,500, a panga, a knife and their IDs.&ldquo;They just questioned me about the Mpeketoni attack and did not prefer any charges against me. I suspect the police tortured me, because of my thick beard which is a matter of faith for me,&rdquo; Faraj said.The father of 11, who trained at Mombasa Medical Training College, said he had earlier on treated some officers after they were involved in a terror attack on Tahmeed bus in Witu.Faraj said while being held at Mpeketoni police station after his arrest, he refused to use a bucket as a toilet and did not take a bathe for two weeks.He said he reported back to work at Mbwajumwali dispensary in September 2014, several weeks after he was released.Faraj said he later on asked for a transfer from Mbwajumwali dispensary to the King Fahad Hospital since police were still pursuing him.
