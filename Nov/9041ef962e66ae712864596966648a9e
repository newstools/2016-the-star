More than 70 students of Outspan Medical College who were planning on graduating today will not do so over a dispute between the college and the students.The Diploma in Medical Laboratory Sciences students of the college in Nyeri town want a refund of fees. They were discontinued from taking a course following instruction from the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board.Student Moses Muriithi said he wasted two years of training and more than Sh400,000 in fees.&ldquo;The board has refused to index us given that we were admitted using wrong criteria. We are asking the school administration to take full responsibility for this mess,&rdquo; he said. Muriithi blamed the college management, saying they were aware of the requirements for them to offer the course, which they failed to honour.&ldquo;The administration is telling us there is a lot of similarity between our course and Applied Biology and that we should, therefore, change to continue learning,&rdquo; student Esther Njenga said.College director Macharia Kiruhi absolved the school from blame and instead accused the regulatory agency of causing confusion.Kiruhi said the grades they admitted students to take the course was guided by criteria issued by the board in a July 19, 2012 letter. The letter from the board reviewed the entry grades for diploma students from C plan to C-. Kiruhi said this year when the board met the school management it indicated that the situation remains as it was before the 2012 letter. &ldquo;This confusion is a result of conflicted positions taken by the board,&rdquo; Kiruhi said.
