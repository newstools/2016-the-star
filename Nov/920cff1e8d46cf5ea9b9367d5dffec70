Tens of thousands of people have filled Revolution Square in the Cuban capital, Havana, for a rally honouring Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.Proceedings began with the singing of Cuba's national anthem and speeches are being given by visiting dignitaries.Castro, who came to power in 1959 and ushered in a Communist revolution, died on Friday, aged 90.Left-wing Latin American leaders are attending the event but many other world leaders have sent delegations.Opinion on Fidel Castro, who ruled Cuba as a one-party state for almost half a century, remains divided.Supporters say he returned Cuba to the people and praise him for some of his social programmes, such as public health and education.But critics call him a dictator, who led a government that did not tolerate opposition and dissent.Attendance at the commemorative event reflects this division.Revolution Square is where Cubans once gathered to listen to Fidel Castro's fiery speeches.The crowd chanted "long live the revolution!" and "Fidel! Fidel!" as the rally got under way.
