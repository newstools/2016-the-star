Nominated MP Oburu Oginga has praised ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi for suggesting a super alliance with Cord. He said ODM leader Raila Odinga and Mudavadi have been duped twice into forming ineffective alliances and it is time they came up with a formidable force for 2017. Last time Uhuru and his cohorts cheated Mudavadi that they were going to make him a presidential candidate, and the next day they claimed he is a mysterious devil that appeared out of nowhere, Oburu said.He spoke in Dadra village, Ugenya, on Saturday. Oburu said Raila and Mudavadi are on the right track and urged them to work with like-minded leaders to grasp to power with the National Super Alliance, NASA. I m very sure William Ruto will suffer the same blow Mudavadi and Raila have suffered. I have heard he is being positioned by Jubilee as a presidential candidate in 2022, let him ask Raila what happened to him after saying Kibaki Tosha , he said.
