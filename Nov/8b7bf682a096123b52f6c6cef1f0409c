But the Star established two of the MPs are from Baringo county, one from Uasin Gishu and another one from Bungoma county.Cheboi did not explain if the MPs were sitting the KCSE exams for first time or are resitting the tests. We registered a total of 25 candidates under the adult education programme and we also have leaders, including sitting MPs, who are taking the KCSE exams, he said.Cheboi said the MPs requested to privately sit for the exams. He said those from Baringo county had been allowed to sit in Uasin Gishu, while the other two were moved to Baringo for purposes of privacy and to avoid interference. The private centres are away from other secondary schools, where other KCSE candidates are taking exams, Cheboi said. He said cannot reveal their names, as this would amount to exposing them owing to their status. May be you can find out on your own. Eventually they will be known at the time the results are released, but at the moment you can find out using your own means, Cheboi said.The institution also registered a 47-year-old mother, who is sitting exams at the private centre in Eldoret.Meanwhile, 20 secondary schools in Kerio Valley have been placed under tight security to allow KCSE candidates sit for their exams in the region where banditry attacks have increased in the last one month.Education officials says the exams have kicked off well in all centers in the reion.MCAs in the area led by Thomas Kigen of Kaptarakwa said the govt should implement more measures to restore security in the region.At the Eldoret GK prison one inmate registered as a candidate and will sit for the exams at the institution.
