Has Kiambu county doubled its revenue to Sh4.7 billion?Or is this just an exaggeration as local leaders claim?Several articles, including one published in the Star, have reported claims by Kiambu Governor William Kabogo that the county has increased its revenue collection to Sh4.7 billion.This increase, he says, has been due to the county s transition to automated systems for revenue collection, including the ability for residents to use mobile money and credit cards to make payments to the county.However, Ngewa MCA Karungo wa Thang wa took to Twitter to state that these claims were false.The MCA said the county has only raised Sh2.2 billion through local revenue, a figure that is far below the revenue collections made by the defunct Kiambu Town Council before 2013, when devolution was implemented.So, we ask: Is Governor Kabogo s claim of increased revenues due to automation true and is the MCA justified in calling him out for making a false claim?PesaCheck has researched the issue, with input from the International Budget Partnership in Kenya, and finds that the claim made by Kabogo is false.According to the annual county government implementation review reports prepared by the Controller of Budget, between 2013 and 2016 Kiambu county collected revenues amounting to Sh1.2 billion, Sh2.11 billion and Sh2.46 billion, respectively, from local sources.While this indicates a year-on-year increase in revenue collection, the governor s claim that the county s revenue collections have increased to Sh4.7 billion is false.The highest amount of local revenues collected was in the last financial year when the county received Sh2.47 billion, which is Sh2.2 billion short of Kabogo s claim of Sh4.7 billion.
