Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has said if he becomes governor, he will not allow foreign investors to take up small-scale business deals that can be handled by local firms in Mombasa.The car dealership industry, he said, will be the most affected. Awiti said foreigners are operating big car dealership investments but have extended their business into the small dealership market in Mombasa. Their presence in Mombasa increased during the [President Mwai] Kibaki regime. We welcome them, but they should deal with the big money investments and leave the small ones to us, Awiti said.He spoke to car dealers, mechanics and garage owners at Ganjoni in Mombasa on Friday. The MP said the industry would have to be standardised.
