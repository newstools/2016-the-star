The National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich yesterday said women, youth and persons living with disability can tender for government contracts under the 30 per cent quota for the disadvantaged category. Rotich said there is no discrimination under the Access to Government Procurement Opportunities framework, based on the economic status of the proprietors or their kins. When it comes to AGPO, we look at women, youth and people with disability. We haven't gone deeper on this to categorise them, Rotich said during media breakfast in Nairobi. There was a public outcry a fortnight ago after Sundales International a firm associated with Uhuru's sister Nyokabi Kenyatta and cousin Kathleen Kihanya was reported to have been awarded a Sh200 million tender by the Ministry of Health under the disadvantaged group category. Rotich spoke ahead of the four-day Second High Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation to be held in Nairobi from November 28. The meeting is an inclusive global forum which helps governments, businesses and civil society to work better together to end poverty. Kenya will root for economic empowerment of women and youth at the forum that targets 3,000 delegates, the first in Africa since the adoption of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 2015.
