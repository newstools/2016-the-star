Businesswoman Esther Passaris has suffered another setback after the High Court declined to allow her political party to be registered. This is the second time she has lost the case after the initial appeal was dismissed by the Political Parties Tribunal on grounds that Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung u was within her right to decline to register Harambee Democratic Party. On Monday, High Court judge Lucy Njuguna said the appeal lacked merit and Passaris had failed to demonstrate how the registrar violated her rights. Passaris said the registrar s decision may have been influenced by powerful people. The registrar, however, denied the claim.She said the assertion by Passaris is farfetched, has no basis in law and should be treated as mere political propaganda. The word harambee is protected by law from use under Section 3 of the National Flag, Emblem and Names Act Cap 99 laws of Kenya, Ndung u said.
