A plan by Ford Kenya rebels to remove party leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula flopped after a court blocked a mutinous National Delegates Conference in Thika town.Rebels had planned to hold a NDC simultaneous to the one called by Wetang&rsquo;ula last Saturday.Trans Nzoia Senate aspirant Ken Wafula, Ford Kenya national organising secretary Peter Munyae and Nairobi chairman Lupesha Komesha said goons were to disrupt their meeting.Wetang&rsquo;ula, who is also Bungoma senator, proceeded with his NDC at Bomas of Kenya. He was declared the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate.Yesterday the rebel group met in Eldoret and said their battle to remove Wetang&rsquo;ula is unstoppable.&ldquo;We condemn the cowardly act by Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s group to disrupt our meeting. Leaders rushing to court to seek political refuge are swines of civilisation,&rdquo; Wafula said.Two Ford Kenya members allied to Wetang&rsquo;ula obtained orders to stop the Thika NDC. They are Caroline Oduor and Chris Mandumandu.Wafula said Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s NDC at Bomas was illegal as it was only attended by 72 out of the 388 members of the council. &ldquo;Wetang&rsquo;ula realised he has lost grassroots support and rushed to court to save face. We will still have him removed,&rdquo; Wafula said.He said the meeting did not have the required quorum and its resolutions are null and void. Wafula said they would go to court to nullify resolutions of the Bomas meeting and have their NDC sanctioned.The group plans to hold grassroots party polls between December 28 and January 28 to elect new officials.The rebel group said the NDC at Bomas had no mandate to declare Wetang&rsquo;ula the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate.They say Wetang&rsquo;ula has abused power, mismanaged the party and had not called a major party meeting in three years. He also wrongly anointed himself flagbearer, they say.
