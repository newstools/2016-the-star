City Hall may soon witness another fight after two MCAs claimed to be Cord chief whip. The majority whip is Karen MCA David Mberia.However, his Parklands counterpart Jaffer Kassam said the ODM top brass has appointed him the majority whip.&ldquo;I was appointed by the party&rsquo;s top organ to replace Mberia, who has not been toeing the party line. The changes are good for the growth of the party,&rdquo; Kassam said.Reached for comment, majority leader Elias Otieno said he is not aware of Mberia&rsquo;s replacement. He said Mberia enjoyed the privilege of having an office as majority whip, but he disrespected the county assembly service board, which allocated him the office.&ldquo;The privilege of him having an office was taken away and he was thrown out. However, his rights were not taken away. I don&rsquo;t know when the resolution to replace him as majority whip was reached,&rdquo; Otieno said.
