Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng’eno has told Deputy President William Ruto, his aide Farouk Kibet and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen to appear before the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee and explain what they know about the NYS scandal. He said Kibet and Murkomen should clear their names after they were adversely mentioned by former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru, when she was questioned about the Sh1.6 billion NYS cash theft. “The eight-hour-long questioning of Waiguru by the PAC gave Kenyans a one-sided story. Unless the views of DP Ruto, Kibet and Murkomen are heard, the truth will be half-baked,” Ng’eno told journalists in Kericho town on Friday. He termed the DP a “doublespeak” person who defended Waiguru and later disowned her after she implicated Kibet and Murkomen in the NYS saga, when she appeared before the PAC. “Just like Waiguru and Josephine Kabura were subjected to hours of questioning by the PAC over the NYS scam, the DP, Kibet and Murkomen should also appear before the House team,” Ng’eno said. Ng’eno said, “Kibet and Murkomen have been moving around with briefcases distributing money suspected to have been from the NYS coffers. Let them tell the PAC the source of such huge sums of money.” He said when the NYS scandal first came to light, the DP prevailed upon Rift Valley legislators not to impeach Waiguru. Ng’eno said Senate majority leader Kindiki Kithure, who tabled Wairugu impeachment motion, was allegedly approached by the DP to drop the motion. He said it is hypocritical and insincere for the DP to attack the Waiguru for implicating Kibet and Mukomen in the NYS scam. “Let the DP, Kibet and Murkomen take bold steps and tell Kenyans the other side of the NYS scam,” Ng’eno said.
