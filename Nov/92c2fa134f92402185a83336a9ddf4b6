Safaricom's value to the economy rose by a third in the full-year period ended in March 2016 compared to the previous year, data released yesterday suggests. The company is estimated to have added Sh414 billion to the economy, 31.42 per cent more than Sh315 billion in the previous year. This is contained in the company's second True Value Report done by audit firm KPMG. This is about six per cent of the country's national wealth, technically referred to as the gross domestic product which was estimated at $63.40 billion (Sh6.40 trillion) in 2015. The estimated value is 10.8 times more than Sh38.1 billion record net profit the giant telco reported during the financial year. The publicly-traded company, owned 40 per cent by the UK's Vodafone, kept about kept about 182,833 in direct and indirect employment, 63.24 per cent more than the previous year's 112,000. KPMG used its own true-value formula to analyse social economic and environmental impacts of Safaricom on people and government. Chief executive Bob Collymore said the number of jobs created is higher when the wider effects on the economy are included. Safaricom sustained over 182 883 direct and indirect jobs during the year and, if the wider effects on the economy are included, this number increases to over 845 846 jobs., he said yesterday during the launch of the report in Nairobi. According to the report, M-Pesa is the greatest contribution to social value by Safaricom in 2016. It shows the social value created by M-Pesa, Safaricom's globally transformative money transfer platform, was Sh184.5 billion, excluding transaction fees. This is 4.45 times the Sh32.63 billion transaction fees earned by Safaricom in the same period and meaning Sh67.36 of value is being created for Kenyan society for every M-Pesa transaction that takes place. The report shows the capital expenditure of the company in the period created Sh15 billion in direct and indirect value, and Sh27 billion with the wider effects on the economy. Collymore, however, said this value was eroded by corruption in the country. This is not directly related to the operations of Safaricom, but the assessment acknowledges that corruption is likely to prevent some of the economic value that Safaricom creates from reaching the intended recipients, he said.
