Moi University acting vice chancellor Prof Laban Ayiro has said he has ironed out differences with North Rift leaders, including Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago who opposed to his appointment. “I have a burning desire to make a difference in Moi University. It will be totally different and we all will be proud of it. Those who had resisted me at first now realise we have no ill intent,” he said. Ayiro addressed students on private sponsorship at the Eldoret West campus on Friday. Mandago had said Ayiro was not the best qualified.
