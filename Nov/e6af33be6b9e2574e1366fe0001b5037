Australian Rugby legend David Campese jets into the country this week for a series of activities that will culminate in a keynote address at the Nondescripts RFC dinner on Saturday.Campese, who was capped 101 times by Australia between 1982 and 1996, will conduct sessions with the Kenya women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s Sevens teams today before attending a cocktail with the rugby fraternity on Friday. Famous for his &lsquo;goose-step&rsquo; &mdash; a hitch-kick motion which left opponents stumbling to try to tackle him, Campese (Campo) scored 64 tries during his 14-year stint with the Wallabies.He was a member of the Eighth Wallabies for the 1984 Tour of Great Britain that won rugby&rsquo;s &lsquo;Grand Slam&rsquo;&mdash;the first Australian side to defeat all four home sides&mdash;England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland&mdash; on a tour. Campese was a member of the 1986 Wallabies that beat the All Blacks 2-1 in New Zealand&mdash;only the fifth international and second Australian team&mdash;to win a Test series in New Zealand. In 1988 Campese received a standing ovation from the crowd after scoring a zigzagging try for Australia against the Barbarians at Cardiff Arms Park. In October/November 1991, Campese was acclaimed the Player of the 1991 World Cup, scoring six tries in as many matches for the victorious Wallabies.Elsewhere, Kenya Cup champions Kabras warmed up for the start of the season with a 28-7 win over Strathmore Leos at the Kakemega showground in a pre-season friendly over the weekend.Andrew Gathua, signed from Blak Blad, tormented the visitors, scoring the opening try before adding the conversion. He did set up the second try for Norbert Lumbwani minutes later and slotted the conversion for a 14-0 lead midway through the half. Fijian forward Sava Racigi scored the third try with Gathua adding the conversion for a 21-0 lead at interval.
