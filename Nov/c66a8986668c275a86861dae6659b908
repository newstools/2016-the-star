Scientists have created a heat-activated metal penis to help men with erectile dysfunction. Developed by experts at the University of Wisconsin in America, the remote-controlled device lengthens to eight inches when heated to 42C. Surgically inserted in the base of the penis through an incision, the one inch metal coil can be turned on by a remote held over the groin, generating a metal field which triggers a current.The coil then warms the implant, making it expand and fully erect.The device is made using nitinol, a metal alloy of nickel and titanium which can change shape in different temperatures. According to The Sun, the prototype device is to be tested on animals and could be available to men within a few years.Asif Muneer from the British Association of Urological Surgeons, told The Sun the device had potential to benefit thousands of men suffering with erectile dysfunction.'There are fewer components than with existing inflatable implants and that reduces the chances of infection,' he said.'Some patients are not suitable for existing treatments because they have already had major abdominal surgery, say for prostate or bladder cancer, and have a lot of scarring.'With this technique, that's not a problem.' Dr Brian Le, from the University of Wisconsin, was among the team who developed the device. He said: 'We demonstrated that an Ni-Ti-based prosthesis can produce the mechanical forces necessary for producing a simulated erection without the need for a pump or reservoir, comparable with existing prostheses.'This is not the first bionic penis to be developed by scientists.
