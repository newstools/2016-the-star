Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has intensified campaigns to recapture the city s top job, with reports his strategy is to reach out to opponents to support him.On Tuesday, he had lunch with his fierce rival Senator Mike Sonko. Yesterday, Kidero shared a platform with businesswoman and governor hopeful Esther Passaris. He urged Passaris to join ODM and support him. That side is congested. I m told they are nine or 10. That house is full and others are now using unorthodox means to remove me from office, he said. But Passaris said she is still in the race. She said, however, she will support Kidero until he completes his term. I am told the national government owes our county Sh60 billion. This is not right because there is no way our governor can work. I will support him to ensure we get this money back, Passaris said.Kidero said, You see they have started looking for me. Even yesterday, one of them looked for me. There were reports Kidero asked Sonko to abandon his bid and support him, then run for governor in 2022.Five people have declared interest in running on the Jubilee Party ticket. They are Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru.So far, Kidero seems to be Cord s sole candidate. Cord leader Raila Odinga s former aide Miguna Miguna will run as an independent candidate, while Passaris has been trying to register a party the Harambee Democratic Party.The Registrar of Political Parties declined to register the party, saying the use of the word harambee is prohibited under the National Flag, Emblems and Names Act. Passaris has appealed against that decision.
