Two-time Kenya Cup champions Nakuru RFC are yet to acquire new players despite losing three during the transfer window that ended 10 days ago.Iwambe Odoyo, Joseph Odero and Martin Owila left the club for Nairobi University s Mean Machine, Kabras and KCB respectively. Wanyore hit the headlines when they became the first team from outside Nairobi to bag the prestigious cup during the 2012/13 season and fought hard to maintain the diadem the following year.Nakuru s team manager Hillary Kisangi, however, still remains upbeat about reclaiming the former glory despite the loss of some of their key players to rival clubs. We were late this season but we will be banking on signing new players the moment the next window opens next year, he said. We have two players from Egerton University s Wasps and Western Bulls training with us but the transfer is not yet formalised, he added.
