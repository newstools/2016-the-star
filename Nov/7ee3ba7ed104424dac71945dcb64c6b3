Ugenya MP David Ochieng (pictured) has said he supports Siaya Senator James Orengo for governor to remove the &lsquo;ungrateful&rsquo; Cornel Rasanga. He said Orengo would be a better leader than Rasanga. Ochieng said he made a lot of sacrifices for Rasanga to clinch the seat, including using his personal resources, but the governor ended up abusing him. &ldquo;I gave him my car and Sh1 million daily for his campaigns when he was broke, but he belittles me,&rdquo; he said.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Ochieng said he will not accept anything from Rasanga, &ldquo;even a banana bought with his money&rdquo;.
