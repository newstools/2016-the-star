Ugenya MP David Ochieng (pictured) has said he supports Siaya Senator James Orengo for governor to remove the ungrateful Cornel Rasanga. He said Orengo would be a better leader than Rasanga. Ochieng said he made a lot of sacrifices for Rasanga to clinch the seat, including using his personal resources, but the governor ended up abusing him. I gave him my car and Sh1 million daily for his campaigns when he was broke, but he belittles me, he said. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Ochieng said he will not accept anything from Rasanga, even a banana bought with his money .
