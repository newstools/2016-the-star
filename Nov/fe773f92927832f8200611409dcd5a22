Witnesses said those who were attacked cried for help by their counterparts while others fought back in the incident at about 3pm.They were apprehended and taken to the station but released at about midnight after Ruto's office intervened, sources said.But Tetu deputy commissioner Herman Shambi denied reports of police violence saying the youths forced their way into the school where a harambee was taking place.Shambi said police took swift action and arrested them, but that they were released hours after Ruto left the school. Investigations are ongoing since the youths were not from Tetu. They were from Karatina and Majengo slums in Nyeri town. They even had a vehicle," he said.He added that some of the members of the group resisted arrest and tried to escape, and that one hit an officer during the chaos.Shambi warned youths against being misused by politicians during 2017 campaigns. He also warned politicians against giving them money to disrupt their rivals' rallies, saying they will be arrested and prosecuted.It was said that two of Gachagua's rivals from Mathira were behind the incident.Social media users criticised police for their action which they described as irresponsible."They think working in a profession where you use guns is salvation. This is uncalled for, barbaric and a gross violation of human rights," one said.Another called for the prosecution of officers who were involved.But a user identified as Hell Kims said: "This is lesson to the youths. Why can't you avoid politics and 'hustle' for your future. Let the youth know this is a wicked world and that your life is yours alone."User Kanja Karuhi asked for the other side of the story, saying a man pictured being beaten by police hurled stones at them and "deserved to be disciplined".
