A fresh report by the Auditor General shows Narok county spent Sh11.65 million on foreign trips with nothing to show for them.In the 2014-15 financial year report, the auditor has accused the county, headed by Governor Samwel Tunai, of unnecessary spending. The county, home to the spectacular Maasai Mara Game Reserve, paid the money as air tickets and travel allowances to staff on travel aboard. Edward Ouko, says in the damning report that although the officials accounted for the money in form of passports and boarding passes, the taxpayers did not get value for money in the joyriding trips. The benefits of the trips were not demonstrated by reports outlining the benefit to the county. In the circumstances, the expenditure of Sh11.6 million on the foreign trips could not be confirmed, the report states.
