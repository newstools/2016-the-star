Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has blamed external forces for trying to create a rift between him and Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka.Speaking on Sunday for the first time over the perceived political differences with Kalonzo, he said the media blew the issue out of proportion. He said Musyoka only cautioned him against being too hard on Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana. I told him when you find a snake on your wife s back, you don t just sit back and watch. You hit it regardless of whether you will injure your wife. That didn t mean we have differed politically, Muthama said.He said he is strongly behind Musyoka and no one can drive a wedge between them. They thought by spreading propaganda I would denounce Kalonzo and form my own party. I m not the kind of politician who seeks self-gratification. I can t fall into such tricks, he said.Muthama, however, maintained he will still push for dissolution of small regional parties to ensure they head to the next election a united team.
