The office of the Auditor General has put the Nairobi government on the spot for failing to account for the billions of shillings it received from the state and cash collected locally during the 2014-15 financial year.In the 2014-15 report, the auditor faulted the Evans Kidero administration for failing to provide supporting documents for Sh1.1 billion legal fees, Sh165 million spent on purchase of goods and services and Sh200 million bursaries purportedly disbursed to needy children. The report, released on Monday and published on the Kenya National Audit Office s website, says the county spent Sh57 million on drugs that were never supplied to hospitals.The trade department made Sh6 million payments for goods and services that were neither disclosed nor were supporting documents provided. The report says the environment department made payments of Sh39 million for unknown goods and services.According to the report, Musyoki and Mogaka and Co was paid Sh5.4 million, Momanyi and Associates Sh60 million, Koceyo and Company Sh5 million and CW Ngala and Co Sh27 million as part of the Sh1.1 billion spent on legal services.The report also raised issues about the county s failure to account for the revenue from off-street parking.According to the auditor, City Hall only collected Sh23.6 million from the law courts, and the sunken and Intercontinental parking spaces with a total of 430 parking slots. Cars are usually double-parked, implying that all parking slots are taken up and even exceeded, which implies that the revenue collected should have been more than the expected revenue from all the parking slots, says the report. The county also borrowed Sh298 million, but this was not captured in approved budget estimates.The auditor could not confirm how the county incurred Sh355.54 million as accrued interest on loans on domestic borrowing. The auditor said the full extent of county borrowing could not be ascertained because the county assembly and national Treasury did not authorise payments.The report also accused the county of failing to maintain a standard leave management procedure for its staff, leading to double payment of leave allowances to 37 employees totalling Sh2.8 million.It says though other expenditure, including per diem and travelling expenses, was budgeted for under the operating expenses, it was also captured under the use of goods and services category. [This] implies the expenditure of the same category is being expensed under another different expenditure category, the report says.The report said the county did not reach its local collection target of Sh13 billion during the financial year and did not give reasons for the failure despite records indicating that it has the potential to collect two times the projections.The report also finds the county at fault for not providing documented evidence for Sh77 billion in pending bills.Also, despite the budget for recurrent expenditure during the year being Sh18 billion, the county spent Sh22 billion with no evidence to show if the county assembly approved the excess expenditure.The office of the Auditor General has put the Nairobi government on the spot for failing to account for the billions of shillings it received from the state and cash collected locally during the 2014-15 financial year.In the 2014-15 report, the auditor faulted the Evans Kidero administration for failing to provide supporting documents for Sh1.1 billion legal fees, Sh165 million spent on purchase of goods and services and Sh200 million bursaries purportedly disbursed to needy children.
