Ford Kenya on Saturday endorsed party leader Moses Wetang'ula as their presidential flagbearer in the 2017 general elections.Wetang'ula said the endorsement set the stage for the three Cord principals to decide who will face off with President Uhuru Kenyatta in the polls."There are those below us who are in a committee planning the way forward. The election is in August so we have about eight months and we are using it well. We are not in a big hurry," he said.He was speaking the party's National Delegates Conference at the Bomas of Kenya.Wetang'ula launched his presidential bid in April.The chaotic ceremony at Muliro gardens was disrupted for nearly half an hour as police lobbed teargas at the main dais forcing the leaders to be whisked away. Two people were seriously injured and rushed to hospital after a stampede as people scampered for safety. The Star, however, established that ODM leader Raila Odinga shelved his plans to attend the event after "intelligence" warned him of the clashes between Ford Kenya and ODM supporters. Ford Kenya supporters had earlier tore and burnt ODM t-shirts and caps in protest that the ceremony was their party affair.
