Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli was among world leaders who congratulated US President-elect Donald Trump. Speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, where he is attending the 328th ILO Governing Council session, he said Trump s win is a triumph for those who understand not only American, but also world politics. I represent Kenyan workers under Cotu as secretary general, African workers under the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity as president and I also represent the world on the International Labour Organisation Governing body, so I correctly predicted his win, Atwoli said.
