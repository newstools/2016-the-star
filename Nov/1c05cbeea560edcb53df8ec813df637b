Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng'eno wants police officers who teargassed Bomet Governor Issac Rutto arrested and charged.The Governor said a police officer threw a tear canister at him. He suffered facial injuries in the incident on November 7 and was flown to Nairobi for treatment and then to South Africa for surgery.Ng'eno said Rutto will remain in danger unless the culpable officers arrested and charged, and others transferred.Blaming the Governor's woes on political machinations, he urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to have all Bomet county security agents moved.Ng'eno said the transfers should be effected before the 2017 general election which will take place on August 8."We know of a political scheme by a senior politician in Kenya to ensure another governor is elected in Bomet county," he said.But he noted it will not be easy to get Rutto out of office as he has become more popular following harassment by security agencies.Ngeno referred back to a time in 1994 when Rutto - a vocational training minister at the time, was attacked by heavily armed thugs.Suspected thugs robbed an AP officer, who was Rutto's bodyguard, of a ceska pistol and cash at Tumoi village in Chepalungu constituency.Rutto, his son and two journalists - Philip Yegon of the then Kenya Times and Sonu Tanu (Standard newspaper) - escaped death narrowly."This is not the first time Rutto had been subjected to state harassment by police in Bomet," Ngeno told journalists in Kericho town."We are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the Jubilee administration wants to plant a new governor on Bomet electorates through the influence of security agents."Cord leader Raila Odinga made the same allegation, saying "a worrying agenda of hate and intolerance" is taking root.This (is the) government s way of dealing with dissents and opponents, real or perceived," he said."Going by the trend, we have reason to believe things will take more ominous turn as we get closer to elections and as Jubilee comes under greater scrutiny."More on this: Raila condemns assault on Rutto, commissioner says Governor claims fictitiousThe governor is yet to return from South Africa where he was flown days after the the attack at Silibwet Stadium.Read: Rutto leaves for treatment in SA after tear gas canister assault
