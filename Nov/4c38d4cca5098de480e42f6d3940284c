East African Breweries has been voted the best firm in ICT innovation in the just concluded annual CIO100 awards for implementing the Distributor Management System to streamline its supply routes. EABL s head of ICT Kenneth Ojwang said the brewer s IT strategy has helped it establish competitive advantage over any competition both within and without the industry, helping it grow sales. He said the system, launched in October 2015, has led to faster and more precise distributor stock management and replenishment, optimal truck utilisation, and reduced cases of out of stock on trade routes.
