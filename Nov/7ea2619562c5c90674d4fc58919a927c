A Kenya government nurse has claimed police tortured him for 16 days on suspicion that he treated al Shabaab militants in Mbwajumwali, Lamu East subcounty.Omar Faraj, 38, said he was arrested during a raid at his house in Witu, Lamu West, while on leave on July 27, 2014.This was after the terror group based in Somalia carried out a series of attacks in Mpeketoni that left more than 100 people dead.Faraj, said he had been looking forward to celebrating Idd Ul Fitr with his family before police arrived at his home in a Land Rover at about 9pm.The nurse, who is now based at King Fahd on Lamu island, said 12 police officers stormed into his house claiming he treated the militants at Mbwajumwali dispensary.He told an inquiry on Monday that he was hit on the mouth and also beaten with the butt of a gun before he was apprehended.Faraj said the officers also slapped his wife and stole their Sh2,500, a panga, knife and their ID cards.The man said this in his presentation to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights public inquiry on security at Lamu Fort.Among those who attended the session led by KNCHR chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori were Lamu county commissioner Joseph Kanyi and IPOA board member Vincent Kiptoo.The nurse said he was held 16 days, three of them incommunicado, at an unknown place while blind-folded.&ldquo;They denied me a chance to go to hospital after they injured my mouth and almost broke my arm with the gun," he said.He added that he refused to use a bucket for calls of nature and that he did not bathe for the two weeks he was held by police."I also had to be content with bedbugs and lice in the tiny smelly cell that held 41 other suspects,&rdquo; said Faraj.&ldquo;They questioned me about Mpeketoni attacks but did not prefer any charges against me. I suspect police tortured me because of my thick beard which is a matter of faith for me. I will keep this beard forever come what may."The father of 11, who trained at Mombasa Medical Training College, said he was aggrieved because he had treated some of the officers who arrested him after a terror attack on Tahmeed bus in Witu area.He said he reported back to work in September that year as he had been in a state of shock.Faraj said he asked to be transferred from the dispensary as police continued pursuing him, making him and his family members uneasy.&ldquo;I feel safe at King Fahd hospital because police officers have not harassed me at this work station,&rdquo; he said adding that their action against him was wrong.Read: Haki Africa gives KNCHR names of 81 Coast victims of forced arrests, disappearancesLocals urged to turn up in large numbersCommission vice chairman George Morara said more cases of extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of those suspected al Shabaab terrorists and sympathisers have been reported in Coastal counties.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy earlier said many residents have complained that their family members went missing during al Shabaab attacks in Mpeketoni.Morara urged locals to turn up and air their grievances without fear.&ldquo;Let us know all this.

She said they will invoke the participation of all stakeholders, including the business community and members of governmental and non-governmental organisations in Lamu.&ldquo;We shall focus on the violation of human rights or where this has been threatened due to insecurity.
