A senator yesterday denied accusations before a Mombasa court she had an extramarital affair with a political activist.Nominated Senator Emma Mbura told senior principal magistrate Francis Kyambia she never had or dreamt of having a relationship with Kalinga Mgandi, a man she accused of defaming her as a &ldquo;harlot&rdquo;. She has sued him for defamation.Mgandi&rsquo;s confession of a love affair with Mbura landed him in court in March. He was charged with improper use of a licensed telecommunication device. Mgandi allegedly sent abusive audio clips saying, Mbura is fond of snatching other women&rsquo;s husbands.&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not woman enough if you are sleeping with your children and snatching other women&rsquo;s husbands using charms. All men in this forum, be careful with this harlot,&rdquo; the charge sheet quotes him as saying. Mbura said the insults were politically instigated. She said in the Malindi by-election, they realised the activist-cum-politician is a Cord sympathiser inside Jubilee. She said she asked why Mgandi backed Cord and Governor Hassan Joho, yet claimed to be a staunch Jubilee supporter.&ldquo;I told him he was like a snake because he claims to support us, yet he was supporting someone else. This did not go down well. That&rsquo;s when he started hurling insults on WhatsApp groups we shared,&rdquo; Mbura said.Judge Kyambia stopped the audios from being played because they contained obscenities. Mgandi allegedly recorded seven audios that he sent to four WhatsApp groups.Mbura said the claims have harmed her family and damaged her dignity as woman. She said she cannot face people who took her as a role model.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m physiological, physically and emotionally affected by the claims,&rdquo; Mbura said. She said her ambition to run for Rabai MP was hurt and damaged. The case will be heard on December 11.
