We cannot run the country based on anger and madness," Raila said.The President made the order in protest to the sacking of Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki - head of UN forces in South Sudan.A document highlighted that UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon was displeased with how the UN mission in South Sudan handled an attack on aid workers at Juba.Kenya said it would pull its forces out after an inquiry accused UNMISS of failing to respond to the July attack which targeted an hotel.Read: Furious Kenya pulls troops from South Sudan"These actions are ill advised and it is not clear whether he acted on his own, driven by anger," Raila said.Noting that on the surface it will look like Kenya is acting tough, the ODM leader said the developments are greatly troubling."Our troops are observed with dignity in peacekeeping missions. Uhuru has extended his local anger to global anger which poses danger to Kenyans," he saidRaila said Uhuru was ill-advised by his advisers, further pointing that "something is wrong and something is failing with our engagement with the international community"."These are indications of diplomatic failures...we have concerns that we are a country run by a Constitution," he said.The first batch of Kenyan troops who served in a UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan arrived home on Wednesday following the presidential order.Major General Benjamin Biwott said batches of soldiers from the roughly 1,000-strong Kenyan contingent would arrive in coming days, although he did not give a precise timing for completing the withdrawal from UNMISS, which comprised about 12,000 troops.He said soldiers had taken part in peacekeeping operations in 44 countries over the past four decades and Kenya was continuing in its other missions.More on this: First batch of Kenyan troops arrives from South Sudan after Uhuru orderUhuru strongly defended Kenya's decision to pull troops out of South Sudan, saying regional peace should not come at the expense of the country&rsquo;s dignity, honour and pride.He underlined on November 3 that the country will fully disengage from the South Sudan Peace Process.The President said the decision to withdraw from the peace process followed events involving the United Nations Mission to South Sudan.Also read: [VIDEO] Kenya unapologetic about pulling troops from South Sudan, says Uhuru
