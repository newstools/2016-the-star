Nairobi governor aspirant Peter Kenneth has said he will develop the city like he did Gatanga if elected. I did it in Gatanga and I will be able to do it in Nairobi. We should be able to deliver services to residents. All we need is commitment, he said yesterday.Kenneth spoke in Mwiki after attending a service at St Anne s ACK. He was accompanied by Kasarani MP John Njoroge, who declared his support for him.Kenneth said Nairobi has adequate resources to enable delivery of quality services to residents but they have not been properly used. The 2013 presidential candidate said construction of new roads and rehabilitation of others will be his priority.Refurbishment and expansion of markets will also be prioritised to open up business opportunities for traders and earn more revenue for the county.Kenneth said corruption and poor leadership have led to underdevelopment in the city. The current Nairobi administration is not doing anything of what is expected, he said. Kenneth was the Gatanga MP between 2002 and 2012. The constituency was feted for proper utilisation of CDF funds during Kenneth s tenure. The reason why I will not vie for the seat I vied for in 2013 is because we should unite behind the President to strengthen his reelection bid, he said.
