The trial of Nzambani MCA Robinson Mativo for allegedly assaulting an employee of former Cabinet minister Kyale Mwendwa last year failed to take off on Wednesday.The prosecution asked principal magistrate Esther Boke to adjourn the case, saying it did not have original documents to support its case. Although Mativo s lawyer Wilfred Nyamu did not object to the prosecution s plea for adjournment, he said it could have been avoided. He said he had incurred huge costs travelling to Kitui from Nairobi on the same day, only for the prosecution to seek adjournment. Nyamu said the case should be expedited. Boke set the hearing for May 22 next year. Mativo is accused of assaulting Nzuki Kimanzi on September 2 last year at the Nzambani Rock site. Mwendwa s family leased the property from the now-defunct Kitui County Council. The assembly passed a motion repossessing the site, but the family has allegedly been reluctant to relinquish it.
