The Wiper Party will field a candidate to challenge Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana in 2017, Kitui Senator David Musila has said.Speaking to the Star yesterday, Musila, who doubles as the Wiper Party chairman, said the decision to field a governor candidate was informed by Kibwana s move to front one of his executives to run against Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr, a Wiper loyalist.Kibwana was sponsored by Muungano, a Cord affiliate party.On Sunday, Kibwana said although he supports Kalonzo Musyoka s bid for President, his party will field candidates in all the other positions across the country, a move Musila said Wiper did not take lightly.He was accompanied by Narc Party leader Charity Ngilu. They urged Kalonzo to work with them in uniting the Kamba community. Since Kibwana has decided to front a candidate against our friend Kilonzo, we are telling him Wiper will sponsor a candidate against him come 2017, Musila said.County Health executive Andrew Mulwa, a Kibwana ally, has announced he will run for political office.Already, those close to him have been campaigning for him to stand for senator against Kilonzo.Kibwana has openly supported his bid, saying that he won t mind if Mulwa went to the Senate to help push for more cash to be devolved.At the weekend, Mutula laughed off Mulwa s bid and challenged the Muungano Party to be ready for a showdown once Wiper starts to fill all political positions in the county.Senator Musila said it was insincere for Kibwana to pledge support for Kalonzo and run against Wiper at the grassroots. To show they honestly are in support of Kalonzo, the one-man show Muungano Party and Narc should fold up and join Wiper so that we can campaign together, Musila said.
