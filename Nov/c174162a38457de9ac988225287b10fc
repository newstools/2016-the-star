Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi on Tuesday donated iron sheets valued at Sh1.5 million to Kangemi traders who lost their stalls in a fire last week.He said the iron sheets will help the affected traders rebuild their stalls; the losses following the Thursday night fire was estimated at Sh10 million.The market which is run by the Kangemi Market Welfare Association had 660 stalls housing at least 3,000 traders.However, speculation is rife that the fire was as a result of a possible arson attack by unknown people feuding over ownership of a parcel of land in the market.Recently, a section of residents opposed City Halls plans to modernise the market at a cost of Sh1.6 billion.The initiative was to be funded by the World Bank working with the county government of Nairobi.While issuing his donation to the traders, the MP said that he will not allow any land grabbers to take over the market."This market is meant to serve all Kenyans. It is not meant to serve individuals and I will not allow any one to grab it," Wanyonyi said."Grabbers have no chance here. Let them go elsewhere," he said.The cause of the fire, which also left some 18 families at the nearby Sodom estate without a home, is yet to be established.
