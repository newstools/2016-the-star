Solid waste management is the greatest headache for Mombasa county and the Kibarani dump site is an eye sore, Deputy Governor Hazel Katana has said.She praised two private companies for signing an agreement to manage solid waste.Katana's confession comes amid public outcry over the strewing of garbage all over the CBD and denial by some county officials.Politicians have added their chorus to the outcry, claiming Mombasa is pathetic, stinking and dirty .The Kenya Maritime Authority has asked the county to relocate the dump site because the level of pollution is enormous. It is yet to be closed.Katana raised concern that the filth will hurt tourism. We are headed for a festive season. Hotels are recording 75 per cent bed occupancy. This [the filth] will be a challenge, she said.Katana spoke on Thursday when Bamburi Cement signed a partnership deal with Geocycle to manage solid waste in Mombasa. Bamburi will provide land while Geocycle will have a plant to manage solid waste.The head of Geocycle, Simon Wothigo, said four billion tonnes of waste are generated annually worldwide and disposed of in dump sites, thus consuming valuable land.He said the plant treats 14 million tonnes of waste annually.
