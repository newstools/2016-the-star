He said the national government planned to expand the Kisumu urban area in 1972 and a Gazette notice was issued in 1976.The land in question was then trust property. The Gazette notice read that on behalf of the Kisumu county council, the national government was acquiring the same land and that anybody who had claims should make an application.Robert Osure, one of the complainants from Kanyakwar, said he is unhappy with the commission s decision. Osure said the list contained names of those paid instead for World Bank projects in Manyatta and Migosi. We have records to show people put in applications stating their claims, inspection and evaluation were done, people were picked and the list was forwarded to the district commissioner s office, Swazuri said. The list was copied to the Lands and Local Government ministries. We have confirmed that payments were made, he said.Swazuri said all the steps were documented and all the people who were compensated signed against their names that they received money.He also read a letter from the district commissioner s office that confirmed that everyone was compensated. People were supposed to move out and pave the way for the expansion of the town, Swazuri said. He said the government gave out titles to the people who applied for the land.
