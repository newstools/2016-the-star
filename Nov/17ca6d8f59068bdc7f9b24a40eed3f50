Bungoma clerics want the decision to withdraw KDF troops from South Sudan reconsidered owing to Kenya's key role in restoration of peace in the war-torn country.The clergymen backed calls by Cord leader Raila Odinga who has chided President Uhuru Kenyatta for making the decision "in anger and madness".Bungoma ACK Bishop George Mechumo said that Kenya should act as a good neighbour much as its soldiers have been returning to the country from the UN peacekeeping mission. The troops have been leaving South Sudan in batches after Kenya said it would have nothing more to do with the peace process.The decision was triggered by the sacking of the Kenyan UN force commander Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki after the failed to save civilians from an attack."We have a lot of Sudanese citizens living in Kenya because of fear of the war in their country. If we refuse to assist them, who else will,'' said Mechumo.Mechumo said that a good neighbours should be ready to assist each other and leave peacefully as the bible states.''Like here in Bungoma, we have so many Sudanese whom have even started big churches and are living with us peacefully. If the war persists in their country, will they ever go back and live in peace?'' he asked.The clergy urged the opposition leaders to stop politicising the matter due to its sensitive nature."The other day they were asking that the country withdraws troops from Somalia. Now they don't want the president to withdraw troops from South Sudan without a wider view of he matter," Mechumo said.Mechumo said that Kenyans troops should assist in bringing lasting peace in all East African countries in the event of an upheaval.The Catholic Church has asked the state to consult widely over the stand to pull out the troops.Read: Raila s statement on KDF is out of ignorance, PSCU says
