Politicians and civil servants should be barred from doing business with the government to reduce cases of corruption, ICPC has said.Executive director Ndung'u Wainaina said politicians holding public office and civil servants should not be allowed to engage in business with the state, directly or indirectly."This should start with cleaning the procurement process. Too much is tendered, but some of the worst corruption is not tendered. Without going to tender it goes through the back of some perverted tenderpreneur process," he said on Wednesday.Read: Is Kenyan flag armband sign of corruption or pride?The International Centre for Policy and Conflict also called for forensic lifestyle audits for all holders of public office.He called for the establishment of an Office of Government Accountability to investigate conflicts of interest when companies do business for the government and public servants stand to gain from the deals."Such an office will enforce requirement that public officials declare all their business interests and links every year. These include shares, loan accounts or any other form of equity in a registered private or public companies," he said."All state institutions would be required to keep a transparent public register of entities doing business with them and public servants will also have to disclose any directorships or partnerships they have with businesses, as well as any remuneration associated with these."Ndung'u asked the government to restructure the anti-corruption commission and give it powers to effectively fight the menace."EACC does not meet the constitutional requirement of structural and operational adequacy or independence," he said."it is insufficiently insulated from political and executive infuence and needs to be reorganised to employ forensic investigators, intelligence operations and specialist internal prosecutors," he said.Ndung'u's remarks come in the wake of various corruption scandals involving public officials and state agencies.The Sh5.3 billion Health ministry scandal implicated, among others, relatives of the President.The Sh1.6 billion NYS scam saw the chair of the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission leave office over links to the money.Also read: EACC commissioners dump Kinisu, asks him to step aside over links to NYS scam
