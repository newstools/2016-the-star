Some 150 primary schools might not receive the digital learning devices by January 2017 in Baringo county due to lack of electricity.The government is set to distribute the devices to 23,951 primary schools across the country in line with its 2013 promise to digitise learning in primary schools. The programme targets 650 schools in Baringo where the digital devices (tablets) are designated to be used by pupils in all schools at the country. Paul Rono, ICT Authority programmes director, said that at least a quarter of the schools across the country might not qualify to receive the technology gadgets by January 2017 owing to lack of electricity."Although Jubilee government has tried very much to roll out rural electrification to cover almost all parts of the nation, most areas are yet to be connected to the national electricity grid. This is frustrating the laptop program," he said.Read:10,000 kids in slums join digital learning programmeApart from electricity, he also mentioned poor school structures, high dropout rates due to drought and insecurity among other challenges in the arid and semi-arid (ASAL) areas.Rono made the comments at Kapkokwon Primary School in Baringo Central sub-county during the official launch of Digital Literacy Program in Baringo county on Saturday.He, therefore, urged the national and the county governments to work together to ensure electricity is installed in all the schools.Rono also asked the governments to ensure infrastructure is improved and pupils&rsquo; retention rate upheld in schools in order to reap from the e-learning program.John Sergon, director e- Government, KLB managing director Victor Lomaria and Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi were present.Cheboi lauded the move by Jubilee government to introduce the devices saying it will help improve the quality of learning in the country."As a county, we appreciate the efforts done by the Jubilee administration in rolling out this program which seeks to take education sector from what it used to be analog to the next level of technology,&rdquo; said Cheboi."Already, we are having up to 150 teachers undergoing the training at Kabarnet ICT centre hoping to soon have all the computer skills so that they could carry on well with the e-learning," said Cheboi.So far, six primary schools have received the devices in Baringo County as the government hopes to complete the project before next year&rsquo;s general election.
