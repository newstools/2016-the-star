Five officers, under whose watch a suspect died while in custody in 2009 at Ngomeni police station in Kyuso, Kitui, are not yet off the hook, Garissa judge George Dulu has ruled.In 2011, a Mwingi magistrate court ruled that an inquest into the death of Peter Mwelenga on December 24, 2009, be closed. But on August 18 Dulu ordered an inquest into Mwelenga s death, with the five officers listed as suspects in the murder.In his earlier ruling, Mwingi magistrate BA Otieno ruled that none of the five officers had a hand in the death of Mwelenga.He, however, said his relatives could pursue compensation for the death.Otieno said it was evident Mwelenga died in the custody of officers Kenneth Kangongo, Geoffrey Mugambi, Johnson Kilonzo, John Koitine and Mohamed Omar. Otieno, nevertheless, said it was not specific which one of them should be blamed.Mwelenga s relatives, through lawyer Kyania Nzili, filed for a revision of the Mwingi inquest and Dulu set aside the lower court s ruling.He ruled in favour of Maurice Ndoo and Kinyua Mwelenga, who were the petitioners in the revision case filed at the High Court in Garissa on July 23 last year.Dulu said it was a mistake for the Mwingi magistrate s court to have found the police officers culpable of the death of Mwelenga but failed to specify an offence or order them to be summoned to stand trial. I order that the officers be summoned by the magistrate s court at Mwingi to appear and participate in the inquest, taking in mind that they will now be suspects, the ruling said in part.Dulu ordered a fresh inquest and ordered the five officers summoned.Nzili on Monday said he wrote to police officers in Mwingi, demanding that the five officers be summoned to appear in court. He said the case had been handed to the CID in Kyuso.Police have been criticised as extrajudicial killings are on the increase.In September, a human rights lobby said the government s divide-and-rule tactic has fuelled extrajudicial killings, mysterious disappearances, gender-based violence and other injustices.The government has rejected claims that police killed 121 people from January to August, as reported by the Daily Nation. The Nation Newsplex database indicated police killed 114 people in the same period last year and that 262 have been killed since 2015.
