The lack of guidelines to manage health workers is the cause of frequent strikes by medics in Nairobi, a report shows.The Health Sector Working Group Report on the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework Budget for 2014-15 and 2019-20 says the county lacks guidelines on promotion, upgrading and re-designation, employee relations and pensions. [This] has contributed to disruption of services through industrial unrest, it reads.The report says shortage of health workers and failure to harmonise, integrate and rationalise devolved medics by the Health ministry and former City Council demotivate workers and undermine services.According to the report filed by Health chief officer Sam Ochola, the sector has 3,581 health workers against the 6,629 required to deliver better services. Since devolution took effect, the county has been hit by frequent strikes and go-slows by medics.Last week, more than striking 200 doctors, suspended the slowdown following a court order.
