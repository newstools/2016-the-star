Commission for University Education secretary Juma Mukhwana has launched his campaign for Bungoma senator.He has told the incumbent Moses Wetang ula not to bow out of the 2017 presidential race.Mukwana, an unsuccessful candidate for the Kabuchai parliamentary seat in 2013, said he would team up with Governor Kenneth Lusaka in the Jubilee Party.He said the county needed leaders from the same party in key positions to work as a team for better services.Mukwana said residents expectations might not be realised if the governor and senator pull in different directions.He spoke at Mabusi Catholic Church in Tongaren constituency during a fundraiser at the weekend.Mukwana was with parliamentary aspirants for Webuye East Dan Simiyu, Kabuchai s Majimbo Kalasinga, Kimilili s Dismus Barasa and Ben Chakwanda of Tongaren.The commissioner said it is disappointing that Wetang ula had kept poking holes in the governor s leadership, instead of coming together to plan how best to use resources for the benefit of the residents.He said if elected, he would use his position to revive cereal banks, where farmers could store produce after a bumper harvest.
