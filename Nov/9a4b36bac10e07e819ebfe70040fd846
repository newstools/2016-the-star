Uasin Gishu woman representative Eusila Ngeny will not defend her post in next year's polls, but will instead run for Soy MP, she has said.She spoke at the weekend during a public meeting in Eldoret town. I have been a woman MP and deputy mayor in Eldoret in the past and I think I will serve well as MP for Soy, Ngeny said. She has been accused of being passive, but she defended herself saying she had performed well as a woman representative.In Soy constituency she will face a tough contest in nominations against more than 10 other Jubilee Party aspirants.Area MP Edwin Barchilei, who has also been accused of being passive for the last four years, has said he will defend his seat.Other aspirants include DP William Ruto's close ally Caleb Kositany and businessman Hezekiah Kosgey, who has been implementing community projects in the area for the last two years.Kuppet official Julius Korir is also considered a strong aspirant for the seat.In the same area, former registrar of the judiciary Gladys Boss Shollei is yet to confirm if she will run for the Senate seat as she had indicated early this year. Shollei had announced her intention to join politics, but since then she has not publicly engaged in any political events. She recently met Kanu youth leaders in Nairobi, sparking rumours she might run on the party ticket.Eldoret East MP Joseph Lagat, former Wareng County Council chairman Paul Kiprop and Uaisn Gishu Senator Isaac Melly also want to run for the post.
