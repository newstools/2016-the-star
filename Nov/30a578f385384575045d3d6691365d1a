The parliamentary committee on health was sharply divided on the value of container clinics that are subject of probe into the Sh3.2 billion Afya House scandal.The 40-feet furnished containers - 99 in number - are said to have been sourced from China at a cost of Sh1 billion, a figure that has been disputed by many factions.The containers have been stored at the National Youth Service yard in Miritini, Mombasa since their importation in two batches in December 2015 and June this year.While a section of the legislators on a tour of Miritini gave the containers a clean bill of health, others said that the cost of equipment installed in the same is exaggerated.Chairperson Rachel Nyamai (MP Kitui South) said there was no problem with the consignment, to the fury of other members who walked away during the committee's media briefing."We have ascertained that we have 99 containers at this yard. One was taken to Nairobi for demonstration. Experts in the committee have ascertained that most of the medical equipment, as per the contract, are available," said Nyamai.Read: Internal audit on Afya House 'a gross exaggeration of figures', CS Mailu says Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, a member of the committee, walked away during the press conference. "I cannot be part of this and we are not in agreement," he later told the Star.Most of the members question how the Sh10 million - value for each container - was reached, and also why the supplier was paid Sh800 million before delivery of the same.Mbui said he wanted to ask the ministry officials some questions, but the committee chair denied him an opportunity."We all saw the containers, the prices are exaggerated and I have a right to disagree with other members," the legislator said.David Karithi of Tigania West told the Star that the containers have no value for the money said to have been spent to acquire them.However, those who supported the ministry of health said the delivery was per the contract.Seme MP James Nyikal said: "Most of the items are per the checklist; however we need to look at the contract papers to see if the procurement process was followed,"He said the containers had most of the items indicated in the checklist, but needed more insights on the issue of the equipment's prices.Read: Afya House scam calls for full disclosure Taveta MP Naomi Shaban asked the health ministry to dispatch the containers to the target sites so that wananchi can start using them."We are satisfied with the portable clinics. The ministry needs to take them to the required sites so that Kenyans can get health services," said Shaban.Dr Izaq Odongo, head of curative and rehabilitative services at the ministry of health, said the clinics had to be stored in wait for locations to install them."We had an issue with land in slum areas. This is why the clinics are still held here in Mombasa. We are on the ground looking for better locations for installation," he said.He said the Sh800 million paid to the supplier was part of the initial payment and the containers are not yet the property of the ministry."The full payment for the contract was to be done after installation of each of the 100 containers on site, which will be done as soon as possible," he told the committee members.Odongo said they shall also advertise for positions of personnel to be seconded to the clinics, which will be in major slums in the country.Read: Uhuru sister, cousin were paid Sh200m Health cash The scandal at the ministry of health was first reported by the Business Daily newspaper two weeks ago.The government has been trying to clarify that the money was not lost, but some MPs still argue that a clinics should at most cost Kenyans Sh3 million."We cannot have a container costing Sh10 million, this is an outrageous price," said the Kathiani MP.
