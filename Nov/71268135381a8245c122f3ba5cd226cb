The Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa president Lassana Palenfo of Ivory Coast was due in last night on a fact finding mission meant to streamline the National Olympic Committee-Kenya constitution.The Noc-k secretary general Francis K Paul has complained the implementation of the constitutional roadmap as required by the International Olympic Committee has apparently been derailed by the Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Arts and Culture.Paul has complained CS Hassan Wario is yet to honour part of the bargain made in the meeting in Lausanne which included the lifting of the disbandment of Noc-k announced on August 25. The CS was expected to issue us with a certificate of registration to show our authenticity to enable us continue with the process but is yet to do so and this has forced us to take a back seat, off the way forward. Paul alleged the Noc-K, through their lawyers received a letter on Tuesday from the Registrar of Sports (dated September 28), insisting she could not give them the clearance they need before the suspension is lifted by Wario.Wario s phone went unanswered when efforts were made to reach the CS.In addition to meeting Wario, Palenfo is to sit in the Noc-k constitutional review meeting at their headquarters this morning where all the 21 affiliates have been invited. From our side, we are on track in ensuring we have the constitution ready as soon as possible, Paul said.As for the elections, Paul said they can only do so once all the constitutional issues have been addressed. He claimed the purported deadline is neither here nor there. We were not given deadlines but guidelines. You can t fix dates in such a process, added Paul, countering the December 31 deadline noted as the date for the completion of the Noc-k harmonisation process.
