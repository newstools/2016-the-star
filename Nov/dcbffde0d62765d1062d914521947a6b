Cord wants to be enjoined in a complaint filed at the Media Council of Kenya by the government against the Nation Media Group over its coverage of the possible loss of money at the Ministry of Health.In a letter to the council, Cord CEO Norman Magaya said the coalition wants to participate in the proceedings as an interested party because the government is not a private entity.He termed the complaint a thinly veiled attack on media freedom and one that is calculated to gag the media for exposing the dirty deals of wala nyama . Our position is that the Jubilee coalition has conceived, bred and nurtured corruption as one of its key performance indicators, Magaya said. In the unlikely event that it decides to set this matter down for a hearing, we wish to inform you that we will come on record as an interested party with a view to helping the council arrive at an informed decision. On Wednesday, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru lodged a complaint with the Media Council against the Nation, protesting the depiction of the government as corrupt, inept and made up of thieves .The minister singled out NTV for a series of its broadcast System ya Majambazi . Business Daily and NTV must be compelled to show where, in the interim [Health ministry audit] report, it is stated that Health ministry officials stole more than Sh5.3 billion... We hope they will table any proof they have, Mucheru said.But yesterday, Magaya claimed Jubilee has no reputation to be defamed. This is a government that has embalmed corruption as part of its DNA and it celebrates the corrupt in its ranks, he said.The lawyer said the government is private property belonging to all Kenyans and no individual can arrogate to himself the monopoly of purporting to feel infringed upon and raise a claim of defamation.We hold the view, Magaya said, that Mucheru s complaint is anchored in a mistaken view that the government is a sanctuary that should not be scrutinised and held to account.
