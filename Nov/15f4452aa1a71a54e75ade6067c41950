Six people have died in Laikipia and 20 people have died in Marakwet as pastoralists pursue grazing for their cattle.Government seems powerless to protect landowners, both large and small, from armed invaders who are stealing livestock as well as getting grass for their cattle.The economic consequences for Kenya are potentially disastrous. Livestock production will plummet. Tour operators are threatening to cancel bookings in the conservancies in Laikipia, now a major tourist attraction. The Sera rhino sanctuary has already been invaded so the future of the rhino in Kenya is in doubt.This is not an issue of poor people seeking grazing during the dry season. This is a power play by big men who hide illicit funds in huge herds of livestock and then use them to try and grab other people's land.Both central and county governments are paralysed. The police do not want to intervene. Once again Kenya stands on the brink of anarchy. Someone must do something.Quote of the day"My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go." - Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk died on 10 November, 1938
