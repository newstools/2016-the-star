Thousands of boda boda operators throughout Kitui plan to support Governor Julius Malombe s reelection and fan out into remote areas to campaign for him.Representatives drawn from all eight subcounties, led by association chairman Kelvin Kivala, told Malombe they will mobilise support.,Kivala said, The massive 11,000-member boda boda fraternity is fully behind the governor. We cannot be taken for granted because we have social, economic and political clout. He spoke on Thursday during a meeting between operators and county officials at Kefri Centre. Malombe, Trade executive Jonah Mwinzi, assembly committee chairman Daniel Ngoima and Mbitini MCA Titus Mbivi were present.Kivala said, We are able to access the remotest parts of the county and mingle with thousands of customers on a daily basis. We can take advantage of this to ensure the governor is reelected. He has proved he is a performer par excellence. Ngoima said, Were it not for the constitutional limit for governors to serve only two terms, Malombe should have been declared governor for life. He should continue serving so Kitui can realise unmatched development. Those who want to dislodge him in 2017 cannot match for development record. Mbivi said, It is common sense for a good performer to be rewarded. Kitui should reward the governor by reelecting him. Malombe, a member of Wiper, has urged national chairman David Musila to resign because of conflict of interest. Musila plans to run for governor. In August, Malombe said, We will fight it out but we are not going to allow a situation where a player is also the referee.
