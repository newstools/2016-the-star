Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has urged Senator Amos Wako to revive peace talks in the region which he said have been elusive. Speaking during the burial of Funyula MP Paul Otuoma s son Malcolm Otuoma Jnr, 19, in Bunandi, Samia subcounty, the governor said Senator Wako, as the chairman, should take the initiative to revive the talks. As leaders we need to work together instead of engaging in constant wrangles. We are doomed to fail if we spend a lot of time throwing salvos at each other, Ojaamong said. Wako said he is happy that the governor had proposed the resumption of the talks. He said the unity talks stalled for lack of quorum in meetings. I will take the initiative to have the talks resume, Wako said. Ojaamong said he will not leave ODM as rumours had suggested. He said he will campaign for Cord leader Raila OdingaThe burial was attended by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Siaya Senator James Orengo, MPs Mary Emaase, John Bunyasi, Fred Outa, Olago Aluoch, David Ochieng and Andrew Toboso.Others present were Supreme Court Judge Smokin Wanjala, Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa and Busia speaker Bernard Wamalwa. Otuoma thanked God for granting him 19 years to be with Malcolm who he said was not only a son but also a friend and a supporter.Speaking at the burial, Mudavadi said the National Super Alliance, which is being crafted, is the only way to regroup, defeat Jubilee in 2017 and recoup the country s image. It is expected to bring on board all opposition parties ahead of the polls.
