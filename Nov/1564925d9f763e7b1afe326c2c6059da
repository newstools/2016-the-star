Governors have laid down ground rules they want the Lands ministry to follow when reconstituting the Land Control Boards.Council of Governors vice chairman John Mruttu yesterday said they have written to Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi. They have asked to engage the council in developing an interim solution before the new law is gazetted. He said if the ministry agrees to their demands, a court case pitting the two levels of government against each other will be withdrawn. The old laws ought to have been repealed as they do not conform with the Constitution, Mruttu said. He spoke at the Hotel Intercontinental during a meeting convened by the ministry to brief the CoG on the National Spatial Plan set to be launched soon. Kaimenyi dissolved all land boards on April 27, citing rampant corruption associated with them.
