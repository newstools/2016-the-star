Some 50 former Lavington Security Limited guards yesterday petitioned Parliament over victimisation and unfair dismissal by their employer for joining a workers&rsquo; union to champion their labour rights.The petitioners want the House to intervene because their dismissal for subscribing to a trade union is against Article 41 of the Constitution, which entitles every person to fair labour practices and the right to form, join or participate in the activities and programmes of a trade union.The petition presented by Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati says Lavington Security subject its employees to underpayment, delayed salaries, denial of leave, including the most deserved maternity and paternity leaves, and non-remittance of their PAYE, NSSF and NHIF dues.&ldquo;We pray the National Assembly, through the Departmental Committee on Labour and Social Welfare, investigate Lavington Security for engaging in labour malpractices and recommend appropriate action,&rdquo; it says.
