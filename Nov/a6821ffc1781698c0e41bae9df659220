We won't tolerate anyone... Women should be given a chance in leadership," said Murang'a woman representative Sabina Chege.The legislators said Lekorere should be given additional security because her life is in danger following Lempurkel's threats and abuses.The MPs, led by Kenya Women Parliamentary Association chairperson Cecily Mbarire, asked Nkaissery and IG Joseph Boinnet to ensure the MP faces the full force of the law."We want to see action taken. Enough is enough. We are concerned that women can be threatened and beaten up, but no action is taken," said Mbarire, who is Runyenjes MP.The cause of the fight between Lempurkel and Lekorere has not been established but the latter claimed her counterpart confronted her wanting to know what they discussed with Nkaissery.Lempurkel reportedly stormed Nkaissery s office after the CS held a meeting with Lekorere and a delegation of MCAs and grassroots leaders from Laikipia county.The two have been disagreeing over how to handle the invasion of Laikipia by Samburu pastoralists from the north.Read: MP Lempurkel fights woman colleague at Nkaissery's officeAmong those who attended the MPs' press conference at Parliament buildings were Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi woman representative), Naomi Shabaan (Taveta), Rachel Nyamae (Kitui South), Maison Leshomo (Nominated), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome) and Joyce Lay (Taita Taveta woman representative).
