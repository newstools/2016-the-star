Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi is set to begin a two-day tour of Lamu county to drum up and solidify support for the party.He is expected on Faza Island today, after which he will officiate over an evening ceremony to formally welcome Governor Issa Timamy, MCAs and other aspirants to the ANC party.The former Deputy Prime Minister is also expected to whip up support for his brainchild the National Super Alliance that has picked momentum.According to a statement by his press secretary Kibisu Kabatesi, Mudavadi will also preside over a public rally in Mkunguni Square on Saturday, after which he will meet opinion leaders.Land issuesHe is expected to address land issues in areas where absentee owners are said to be targeting huge profits from Lapsset. It is said some new landowners are compensated at the expense of locals because of selective issuance of title deeds.There is also the issue of the National Land Commission acquiring large parcels without consulting the Lamu government, as required by law.Lamu is a symbolic homecoming for the ANC leader because Timamy chose to decamp from the Jubilee Party to Amani after UDF merged with other parties to form JP.Every indication was that Timamy, who hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta mid-year, was willing to join JP if Uhuru implements infrastructure projects, such as the Garsen-Mokowe road. Mr President, if you could ensure that this road, which leaders have promised to tarmac for 50 years, is finally tarmacked, maybe then we could work together, he said then.Party supportTimamy has since stated that he will run on the ANC ticket, as he would rather belong to a party that has equal regard for its members.The governor also pledged allegiance to Mudavadi, saying he would rather stick with him since he had been his longtime political mentor. Critics termed the move political suicide.It would seem Mudavadi s strategy is to consolidate his Western region base as he solidifies support in Coast.Mudavadi s NASA idea has been well received at the Coast, where he is seen as the candidate who can dethrone Jubilee leaders.Notably, Mudavadi last month wooed Kaya elders on a whirlwind tour of Kwale and Kilifi counties, where he received MCAs and strong parliamentary aspirants into ANC.
