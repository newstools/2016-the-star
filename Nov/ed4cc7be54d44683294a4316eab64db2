Bandari FC are confident they will finish in the top eight after hitting Posta Rangers by a solitary goal in the SportsPesa Premier League match in Nairobi last weekend.Technical director Edward Oduor yesterday said he was sure the team would win the remaining two league matches to get the points required to finish in the top eight.According to Oduor, Bandari will be going for nothing short of victory when they host Western Stima in Mombasa this weekend and has appealed to fans to give the team the much needed support.Oduor said the technical bench has identified players, who will do duty for the team in the remaining matches and expressed hope they will rise to the occasion. It s true we lacked consistency at some point in the league which saw us field different sets of players in different subsequent games and this eventually affected the end results, said Oduor, adding that they have since sorted out the mess and are on a roll.
