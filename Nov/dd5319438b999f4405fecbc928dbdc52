Senator Hassan Omar has supported a bill on fair use of mineral resouces and use of Kenyan workers in foreign exploration and exploitation.Omar said on Sunday the Local Content Bill, 2016, will benefit the people of Mombasa and the Coast.He said the Bill sponsored by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi will also help Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu counties, where the coastline contains natural gas discovered by British Oil and Gas Ltd .Omar said once enacted into law, it will ensure the British company uses Kenyan resources, including workforce, materials and skills, thereby creating jobs.&ldquo;Signs show Kenya has a significant potential in gas. We are a mineral nation, and if we don&rsquo;t protect these resources through laws, we will lose our wealth,&rdquo; he said.Omar spoke at Ziwa La Ng&rsquo;ombe in Nyali constituency after a clean-up drive.The senator said Mombasa, Kwale and Lamu counties and the surrounding communities must get maximum benefit from all resources in the Indian Ocean.&ldquo;It is impossible to have British Oil and Gas explore minerals in Kenya and bring in engineers and other skilled persons from the UK. If they want to explore in Kenya, they must hire the local communities,&rdquo; Omar said.The Fisheries Act, recently signed into law, creates an opportunity for Mombasa youth to benefit from the value addition plants to be established in Mombasa and other parts of the Coast.A task force was formed to look into the possibility of establishing value addition plants at the Coast. It will ensure local youth are the biggest beneficiaries of the facilities.
