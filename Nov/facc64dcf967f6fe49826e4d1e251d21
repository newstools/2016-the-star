South Sudanese rebels have released about 70 Kenyans whom they had detained.Sources said the group which was recently arrested by the South Sudan's armed opposition SPLM-IO worked for non-governmental entities in the rebel-controlled areas.It also emerged that the opposition's movement move against the Kenyans was in retaliation to Kenya&rsquo;s move to deport SPLM-IO spokesperson, James Gatdet Dak to South Sudan.Goanar Gordon Yien, secretary in the office of the chairman, on Tuesday said 72 aid workers arrested by SPLM-IO field commanders and governors had been freed.Yien said those held siege were freed after the former vice-president, Riek Machar, ordered their release.Machar reportedly gave the order on grounds that the workers were innocent and had nothing to do with Dak&rsquo;s deportation.Machar&rsquo;s spokesperson was picked from his residence in Nairobi on Wednesday by uniformed and non-uniformed officers claiming to be Kenyan authorities.On Thursday November 3, Dak was flown to Juba and imprisoned. Although not much is known about his situation, opposition officials fear he could be killed."We heard he is safe but for us we are not sure. We are concerned about his situation. We can&rsquo;t trust Juba government," said Yien.He urged the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) member states to put pressure on Juba government for Dak's immediate release.Dak, who is also a United States citizen, was deported after he posted a statement on Facebook welcoming United Nations Secretary General&rsquo;s decision to dismiss its peacekeeping boss in South Sudan, Lt General Johnson Ondieki.Opposition officials alleged that First Vice president, Taban Deng, proposed names of 15 South Sudanese opposition figures to be deported to Juba.The plan, sources said, was to bring alive politicians they accuse of spreading war messages. It was also intended to discourage war mongers residing in Kenya.Read: UNHCR fears for Machar spokesman's safety after deportation from KenyaAlso read: Machar rebukes Kenya for spokesman's deportation, calls for release
