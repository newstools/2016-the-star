Youth completing universities and colleges have been urged to create jobs.Nyandarua Education executive Peter Macharia, chief officer Charity Maina, author Henry ole Kulet and Nyandarua governor aspirant Simon Kanyingi attended a graduation on Wednesday at Mirangine polytechnic, Ol Kalou. We know many people with degrees but who don t want to be employed. Going to the top requires people who are innovative and willing to start their programmes, Macharia said.Maina told graduands not to focus on getting government jobs as the wage bill is already beyond the limit. Start businesses. A lot of money is in self-employment, not in offices, she said. Maina urged youth to unite and start companies to benefit from the 30 per cent government opportunities.Kulet, who is also the institution s board of management chairman, urged youth to make use of their training and talent to improve lives.Kanyingi, who is also a businessman, said, Do not be intimidated by those who say hakuna kazi (there are no jobs). I am living testimony that you can make it in life even if you don t get a white-collar job. He said Kenya is growing and developing as a nation, and to achieve Vision 2030, those graduating from technical institutions should play their role. Do not take your certificate back to the village. Go somewhere and start something, he said.
