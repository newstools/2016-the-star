I am living testimony that you can make it in life even if you don&rsquo;t get a white-collar job.&rdquo;He said Kenya is growing and developing as a nation, and to achieve Vision 2030, those graduating from technical institutions should play their role. &ldquo;Do not take your certificate back to the village. Go somewhere and start something,&rdquo; he said.
