Two Kakamega governor aspirants urged Cord leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta to allow fair primaries and no direct nominations. Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe said demands for direct nominations should be ignored.The two are challenging Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on the Ford Kenya and the Jubilee Party tickets, respectively.Khalwale said on Saturday Raila he might find himself in a predicament if he yields to pressure for direct tickets by Nyanza governors who have developed cold feet about competing in open nominations. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Kakamega, because I&rsquo;m up to the task and will definitely edge out Governor Oparanya in 2017,&rdquo; Khalwale told Raila during the burial of Clara Kibukosia in Mukumu, Kakamega, on Saturday.The senator said he will support Raila&rsquo;s presidential bid if he is picked by the coalition.Yesterday, Anangwe said governors demanding free tickets have under-performed and are unsure of reelection. He said they also fear that &ldquo;rampant corruption&rdquo; in county governments could send them packing at the nomination stage. &ldquo;These governors are jittery about their prospects, not only about competitive party nominations, but also the general election, in which most are likely to be voted out,&rdquo; he told the Star in Kakamega. Anangwe said direct tickets will undermine internal party democracy and legitimise lack of accountability. Uhuru and Raila are facing a common headache as powerful governors want direct tickets, yet parties pledge fairness.At least 15 governors, including Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu) and Migori&rsquo;s Okoth Obado, say they deserve to bypass primaries and the people&rsquo;s will.Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua has demanded a direct ticket. He says at least 10 Rift Valley colleagues, who want rewards for &ldquo;their good work&rdquo; for Jubilee.
