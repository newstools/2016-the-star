Kenya chances of qualifying for next year&rsquo;s ICC World Cricket qualifiers received a major blow when they went down to Hong Kong in ICC World Cricket League Championship match at Nairobi Gymkhana yesterday.Chasing a revised target of 173 in another rain-soaked match, Kenya were bowled out for 133 for a 39 runs loss.

On resumption, the match was reduced to 25 overs and Kenya given a target of 173. Lucas Oluoch gave Kenya a well deserved breakthrough when he uprooted the stumps of Kinchit Shah with only two runs scored. Skipper Barbar Hayat opened his account with two consecutive boundaries off Oluoch in the fourth over to get Hong Kong to double digits. The two shared 19 for the second wicket before Kenya made their first bowling change, bringing on Narendra Kalyan for Nehemiah Odhiambo. Kenya made their second bowling change in the 10th over, bringing on Nelson Mandela for Oluoch and Hayat welcomed him with another six to lift his side to 44 in 10 overs. With the board on 60 after 12 overs, Kenya missed the biggest chance of the inning when Irfan Karim missed a stumping on Hayat off Shem Ngoche. Hayat continued with his confident batting display and alongside Chris Carter, they reached the hundred stand in the 18th over. With wickets not forthcoming with 10 overs to go and the board on 120, Oluoch was brought back into the attack and it paid off when he dismissed Hayat on for 78 from 64 balls.
