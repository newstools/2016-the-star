The Association of Construction Managers wants the government to streamline the industry to prevent further deaths from collapsed buildings.Addressing journalists on Saturday, the Association's chairman Nashon Okowa termed the continous disasters as appalling. Despite the continuous occurrence of such tragic events, little is being done to guarantee the safety of structures being put up in the country leading to the loss of lives of innocent civilians, Okowa said.This is after a ten storey building collapsed in Kisii county killing nine people.More on this read; Death toll in Kisii building collapse rises to nineIncident commander Pius Masai says that nine people are still missing but the number could be higher. This is a despicable lack of construction oversight and regulation by the responsible organs. These organs need to realize that it is not enough to have laws and regulations only and it is much more important that they are put into practice, Okowa added.The association called upon the national and county governments to enact legislation that enforces the inclusion of construction projects managers for the sake of integrity and accountability. We are also in the process of drafting a bill which will soon have it introduced in parliament that will help in sealing those gaps in the construction industry, secretary general, Robert Obuch said.
