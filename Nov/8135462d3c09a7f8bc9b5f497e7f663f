Scientists have launched a technology to speed up crops and livestock breeding.Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa-International Livestock Research Institute Hub director Appolinaire Djikeng yesterday said the technology uses tools that process genetic data quickly, accurately and affordably.He said it will help scientists to shorten cycles of breeding new improved varieties of crops and livestock in the continent.The new Integrated Genotyping Service and Support will enable African breeders to utilise the newest molecular tools to improve crops and livestock. The director said the technology allows for the selection of DNA, which is a significant molecule that carries instructions required to reproduce, develop and live. It will also enable breeders to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis for resistance to diseases, such as maize lethal necrosis disease, he said.Djikeng said the tool will help speed up the traditional ways of livestock breeding, in which farmers wait up to two years before identifying the desirable traits for breeding. This new technology gives the ability to zoom into the DNA of the animal or plant in about six months and identifying traits desirable for crossbreeding, he said at the ILRI offices in Nairobi.The technology is a collaboration between BecA-ILRI and Diversity Array Technologies in Australia, who are helping with operation of the technology, which is both a physical and online service. The platform costs about Sh900 million ($9 million) to be installed and for personnel to be trained.He said the organisation will work with Training of Trainers, who will in turn train breeders to get information from seed companies on what varieties to breed.Diversity Arrays Technology founder and director Andrzej Kilian said the technology provides genotyping, bioinformatics, genetic analysis and breeding support services to crop and livestock improvement programmes.It can be used by any individual, regional research organisation, small and medium enterprises, large companies operating in Africa, or international research centres with particular focus on the African national agricultural research system breeding programmes.
