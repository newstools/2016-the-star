The quack doctor arrested in Nandi County last week had performed eight 'successful' surgeries before he was stopped, the county chief health officer says.Dr Edward Serem told County Health Committee members that Ronald Kiprotich Melly was so meticulous in his work that nobody would have suspected he was unqualified. Serem tabled a of list of nine surgeries performed by the quack between June 5 to July 14, 2016, in which only one patient died. During the surgery he and a group of other doctors carried out, the patient who was then expectant died because she was on 'stage four' of the complication but they managed to save the baby, Serem said.The health committee, chaired by Norbert Maiyo, asked the government not to punish Melly but instead train him fully to continue with his good work.Serem was questioned for two hours by the committee members, who were investigating how the quack was posted to a government hospital.Before he was arrested by the Kenya Medical and Dentists Practitioners Board, Melly was the medical superintendent at the Meteitei Sub-county hospital.He was among the 106 doctors, pharmacists and dentists posted to various hospitals across the country on completion of the mandatory one-year internship.He was posted to the Kapsabet County Referral Hospital by the intergovernmental relations technical committee via a letter dated April 14, 2016.It emerged that he had failed to complete his internship at Kendu-Bay Mission Hospital but was mysteriously posted as a qualified doctor.He claimed to have been a medical student at the University of Nairobi, but the university has furiously denied this.His former school, Tinderet Secondary School, confirmed that Melly scored a C-minus in the 2008 KCSE and is yet to collect his certificate.The chairman of the board of the institution, advocate Paul Lilan, said during that year, the best grade the class posted was a B-minus and not B as claimed by the suspect.Also read: Seven quack doctors found busy treating patients in crackdownUsers require no prior registration and should simply send the name of the doctor to 22495 or the online portal health.the-star.co.ke, to get a response whether they are registered with the Board.Anyone can also type the name of a medical facility in Kenya to verify if it is registered with NHIF.
