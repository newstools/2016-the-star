City Hall officials were yesterday put to task over stalled projects, poor roads and drainage.Speaking at a public forum on projects implementation by the Transport sector, residents said some projects started more than two years ago have not been completed and contractors are never seen on site. Construction on Manyanja Road and Harakati bus station has stalled. If you look at the contentions on the signboard, they show the projects were to be completed last year, resident Suba Churchill said. He said most roads have been turned into dumping sites, do not have street lights and are full of potholes. Manyanja Road is always infested with rats and the area becomes flooded when it rains because of poor drainage, he said.Resident John Kinuthia said most of the roads do not have pedestrian walkways. He said the few with pathways have been invaded by hawkers and boda boda operators.
