President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Coast team to spearhead the Jubilee Party campaigns on Saturday took the battle to his rivals&rsquo; doorstep.They were in Mtwapa, Kilifi county. They accused governors Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa) of stifling development and having questionable academic papers.They said the two had misplaced priorities, cannot lead and should be voted out.Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro and banker Suleiman Shahbal discredited the two governors, saying they failed to meet the residents&rsquo; expectations. &ldquo;We shall be doing an injustice to ourselves and the heroes of this country, if we reelect them,&rdquo; Shahbal said.Team leader Munga&rsquo;aro said more than Sh51 million had been stolen from Kilifi county by relatives of senior politicians and officials. He said the total amount could hit more than Sh200 million. The Kilifi North MP said such people should not be entrusted with county leadership.Shahbal, who lost to Joho in 2013, said Mombasa had been turned into a partying county. He discredited Joho&rsquo;s efforts to set up cabro roads, saying development is not measured by the number of cabros placed but by the jobs created. Mung&rsquo;aro said during the grand coalition government the current opposition headed the ministries of Lands, Water, Irrigation, and Infrastructure.
