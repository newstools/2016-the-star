Gatundu MP Moses Kuria, the self-proclaimed fiercest defender of the Jubilee government, suffered a big blow when his name was left out of the team to spearhead President Uhuru Kenyatta s national reelection campaign.The Jubilee Party held its first National Governing Council meeting on Friday last week at the Bomas of Kenya to deliberate on a number of issues. The campaign team was named amid discontent among members from some regions who felt left out or said their region was not properly represented.Deputy President William Ruto was at pains to calm the enraged members and promised them that their concerns would be looked into. After deliberations, veteran and new politicians, the majority of them MPs, were picked to make up the national campaign team for the Jubilee Party.From Central they include MPs Alice Ng ang a, David Kiaraho, Esther Murugi, Nderitu Gachagua, Njogu Barua, Sabina Chege, and Senator Kembi Gitura.The absence of Kuria s name raised eyebrows since he is one of the most vocal MPs in Parliament and was expected to be a key player. Kuria had indicated in various meetings in his constituency that he would be in the team. But his exclusion raises questions of whether he still enjoys the support of the two top Jubilee leaders Uhuru and Ruto as he had led made many people to believe.
