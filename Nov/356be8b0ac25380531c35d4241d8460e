The KCPE exam results will be released by mid-December, after teachers finished marking the English composition, Kiswahili insha and the Kenya sign language on Wednesday. The rest of the subject papers are multiple choices answer sheets and are normally marked using computers. A total of 952,472 candidates sat the exam from November 1-3 in 26,308 centres. Traditionally, the release of KCPE exam has always been at the end of December, but strict examination management and 2017 being an election year has seen the release pushed forward.
