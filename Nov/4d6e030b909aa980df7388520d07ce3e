Taita Taveta residents will benefit from a pioneer international forest bond that raised Sh15.2 billion when it was issued on Monday.Part of the money will be used to protect forests by supporting residents income-generating projects. The bond was issued by the International Financial Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, and was backed by miner BHP Billiton.The five-year bond raised Sh15.2 billion ($152 million) mainly from institutional investors, such as pension funds.The IFC said the bond had been intended to be half the size, but was increased because of demand. It allows investors to opt to be paid in carbon credits, rather than cash.Those who opt to receive credits or permits to emit one tonne of greenhouse gas, can either use them to cover emissions or sell them on the carbon credits market. To pay investors a carbon credit coupon, IFC will buy carbon credits from a project that follows the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD, scheme... The project from which IFC will purchase carbon credits is the Kasigau Corridor REDD project in Kenya, the IFC said when it issued the bond.The Kasigau Corridor REDD project is run by Wildlife Works, a company that was founded in 1997 and runs similar projects in Asia, Central and South America.The Kenyan project covers 500,000 acres of dryland forest of the corridor between Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks in Taita Taveta county.
