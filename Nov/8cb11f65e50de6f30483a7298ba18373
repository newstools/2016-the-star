Plans are underway to legalise the settlement of more than 500,000 squatters in the Turbo-Mautuma settlement scheme in Lugari subcounty, MP Ayub Savula has said.Parliament s Environment Committee last Friday received written submissions from the communities living in the scheme. Panel members said they will push for the degazettement of close to 10,000 acres of forest land to settle the squatters. The squatters were moved from their ancestral land in Vihiga county to allow for construction of the Mudete Tea Factory and the district headquarters now county headquarters in the early 1990s.Some squatters were moved to the area from Mt Elgon. They do not have title deeds, but have lived on part of the Lugari forest land for years.Environment Committee chairperson Reginalda Nangabo said the exact number of the squatters will first be determined so degazettement is done at once.
