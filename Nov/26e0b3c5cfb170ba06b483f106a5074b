Part of the Sh51 million that disappeared in Kilifi county has been recovered. Finance chief officer Ben Chilumo said with the help of investigators they have traced Sh8 million.He denied reports that the county lost Sh1.18 billion through irregular payments to five Nairobi companies that never offered any services. The county has released a statement detailing how the money was spent.In the statement, Chilumo said the county learnt that the allegations on the loss of Sh1.18 billion were based on a list of payments made by the administration. We have verified these payments are genuine transactions made by the county government, for goods and services rendered. Some of the payments are for taxes withheld and paid to the Kenya Revenue Authority, while some are monies paid to our projects retention account held at the Diamond Trust Bank, he said. The five companies Chilumo said Sh340 million was moved in inter-account transfers between the county s bank accounts at Central Bank of Kenya. I wish to confirm that only Sh51 million was irregularly paid to various accounts belonging to companies based in Nairobi, he said.A committee hearing the case was last week informed that the money was fraudulently wired to Daima One Enterprises, Leadership Edge Associates, Kilingi Investment, Makegra Supplies and Zohali Supplies.Read: Sh51m reported missing from Kilifi county accounts
