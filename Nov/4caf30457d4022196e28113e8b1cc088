The CID is on the spot for failing to institute criminal investigations against Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa, a year after formal complaints were launched against him.The MP is facing separate criminal prosecutions for the misuse of CDF funds; he is alleged to have illegally sold a 5.7ha piece of land using forged documents. The land has since been reclaimed by the ownersBut Ndegwa has refused to refund the Sh4 million that he was paid by the buyers, Yusuf Abasheik and Mohaddin Sufi, who have accused him of consistently issuing bouncing cheques.The two have written to to the Chief Justice, through Muslims for Human Rights, seeking his indulgence and intervention with a view to deliver justice.Trails of copies of slips, and agreements in the Star's possession show Ndegwa forged the late Omar Barisa's signature in the acquisition of the prime land in Hindi Magogoni. Barasa died 11 years ago.Using a forged certificate of power of the attorney, purportedly signed on September 24, 2010 by Barisa, he sold off the land to the two businessmen.But anomalies were spotted during the land transfer, resulting in the MP's promise to repay the brother the Sh4 million and an additional Sh2 million as a gesture of apology for taking long to make the refund.&ldquo;As reimbursement, the MP agreed to be pay by issuing monthly post dated cheques of Sh1 million through agent Sheikh Mohamed Abudkadir within six months," Salim Wampy from Muhuri said in the letter to the CJ, corroborating copies of document the Star has."All the cheques bounced as evidenced in notices of dishonour from Gulf African Bank the recipient bank."Ndegwa declined to comment when the Star reached him by phone.Muhuri filed a complaint with the CID in Mombasa but no action was taken, forcing them to lodge another complaint with the DPP on July 15, 2015.The DPP referred the case to the CID in a copied letter. On August 1, 2015 the CID responded directing Muhuri to advise the complainant to report to the Land Fraud Investigations Unit at its headquarters.The rights group and the complainant reported to the CID in November.&ldquo;At the unit we were informed by one Ndumba Thangalani that the necessary steps will be followed and that the officers will be coming to the ground for further investigation," the letter to the CJ reads."To date there has been no formal communication from him. It has been almost a year and nothing has been forthcoming."In June 22, 2015 a letter to CID the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said the allegations that had been levelled against the MP pointed to forgery, obtaining money by false pretences and issuing bouncing cheques,criminal offences which call its investigations.
