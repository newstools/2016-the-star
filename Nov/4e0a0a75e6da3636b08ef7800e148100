Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s visit to Tharaka Nithi on Friday heightened political squabbles.The lack of goodwill between Governor Samuel Ragwa and MPs was evident, as he was kept in the dark about the meeting&rsquo;s agenda.Ruto was to arrive in Chuka at 10am but was held up at Kasarani where he had joined President Uhuru Kenyatta to launch a women&rsquo;s empowerment programme. A chopper carrying legislators arrived in Chuka at the same time Ruto was expected to land, but it proceeded to Chogoria, Maara constituency, after Ruto had not arrived as planned.Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki, woman representative Beatrice Nkatha, Muthomi Njuki (Chuka Igambang&rsquo;ombe), Alex Mwiru (Tharaka), Kareke Mbiuki and Mpuru Aburi were in the chopper.Governor Samuel Ragwa waited for Ruto in Chuka without knowing the schedule had changed. Ruto later arrived at around 3pm, opened Chuka CDF offices and later presided over a fundraiser at Chuka Catholic Church.Kindiki and Njuki (pictured) were the first to welcome him when he alighted.Ragwa&rsquo;s seat conspicuously ws not reserved near the DP&rsquo;s and Maara MP had to intervene to ensure Ragwa sat next to Ruto. Kindiki criticised Ragwa for misappropriating county funds. &ldquo;Tharaka Nithi is not an exception. If you have misappropriated funds, we&rsquo;ll come for you, be it in the sea, on land or in the air,&rdquo; he said. When Ragwa rose to speak, he was booed and almost stopped from talking by Njuki&rsquo;s supporter.A priest presiding over the event pleaded with the crowd to let him speak. Later in the day, Njuki had a rough time in Maara, Ragwa&rsquo;s support base.
