Integrated Internally Displaced Persons have threatened to boycott the 2017 general election, alleging the government has neglected them.They said it would be immaterial for them to vote, yet the same vote exposed them to suffering and abject poverty. The IDPs yesterday urged the government to help them return to their former homes in the Rift Valley and also give them funds to start life afresh. They spoke at Kirathimo social hall in Limuru constituency.Chairman David Kariuki said the state has failed to recognise them despite their persistent visits to various government offices. Why should we vote and yet when we voted in 2013, we had been promised that our plights will be resolved. We were displaced from our homes in early 2008 after the 2007 disputed presidential election results, he said. A lot of people lost lives, our property was destroyed and livestock shared by our aggressors. We were left poor until today. The IDPs urged the Kiambu government and well-wishers to give them financial support to help them start income generating activities to uplift their standards of living. Some can start car washes, selling of farm produce in the market and other activities to earn a living, Kariuki said. Former Limuru MP Peter Mwathi urged the national and county governments not to take the issue for granted and resolve it. The government has settled many IDPs and there are a few remaining. I feel that both levels of government have a role to play to improve the IDPs' lives. The issue should be handled with a lot of care because it deals with people who have suffered, he said. Mwathi asked elected leaders, in whose areas integrated IDPs are still accommodated in cheap rental houses and people's home, to take the issue to Parliament. They have continued to keep quiet about the issue. They should table the issue for discussion until something is done, he said.
