The state will settle members of the Isahakia community in Naivasha, who have waited to be settled for more than 50 years.Last week, community representatives were hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta in State House.Community members met in Naivasha to mark the day and thank the government. The community, working as porters, arrived in Naivasha in the 1800s with Lord Delamere and was among the first communities in Naivasha.For years, they have cried foul after their land and cattle were confiscated by the colonial government and they say they have never been compensated.Speaking in Naivasha, community chairman Ali Faarah said their journey has been long and painful, and finally justice will be done.Past governments have not resettled them, he said, thanking Uhuru for stopping further suffering of the community.
