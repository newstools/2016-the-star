Cord leader Raila Odinga (pictured) yesterday welcomed calls to unite and form the National Super Alliance like the mighty River Nile to remove Jubilee. Yesterday he said Cord is open to partnering with like-minded leaders to form a stronger force.Raila spoke at Magongo in Mombasa. Present were Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, woman representatives Mishi Mboko (Mombasa) and Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi), and MPs Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe) and and William Kamoti (Rabai), Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana and Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo.Raila dismissed Deputy President William Ruto s tour of the Coast, terming it a waste of time. He said Jubilee is not strong enough to win votes at the Coast. I heard you had visitors here at the Coast. They said they want to take over but I want to tell them to completely forget about it, Raila said. ODM is becoming strong and Cord is getting stronger while others from the opposition are joining us. Our aim is to form a big river like the mighty River Nile. This river emanates from Lake Victoria and is joined by other small rivers to become the mighty Nile. Raila said he is not too old to run for President. He cited Nigeria s Muhammadu Buhari who was elected when he was 72 years old. Raila is 71 years old. The people of Nigeria decided to elect a president who older than me. I urge you all to join hands in this journey, he said. Raila accused Jubilee of failing to deal with corruption.
