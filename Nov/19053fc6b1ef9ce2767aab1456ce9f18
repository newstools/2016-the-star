The Kisii county government is not to blame for the collapsed building in which eight people were killed and 45 others injured, the governor has said.James Ongwae yesterday criticised statements by made by Infrastructure CS James Macharia when he appeared before the National Assembly Transport Committee.He said it is wrong to say the county government ignored advice from the National Construction Authority to suspend the project. Macharia attributed the collapse of buildings to poor effort by the county to approve and supervise constructions. Ongwae added, The claims that the county was unaware and did nothing are uncalled for... This culture of passing the buck must stop.
