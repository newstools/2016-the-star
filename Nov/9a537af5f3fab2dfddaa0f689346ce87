The Kilifi assembly has suspended business to concentrate on alleged corruption and irregular spending within the county government.Assembly speaker Jimmy Kahindi on Friday said the recent allegations involving county officials calls for special attention.Taking centre stage will be the reported loss of Sh51 million from the county government account and the Education department s unspentSh1.2 billion meant for 206 modern ECDE centres.Kahindi said the assembly will from yesterday concentrate on unravelling the mystery rocking the county.The money was allegedly siphoned from the Kilifi county main account at the Central Bank of Kenya through the Integrated Financial Management System and internet banking. We have agreed as a House that from Monday [yesterday] only committees will be sitting to interrogate and investigate the theft of more than Sh51 million from the county government.We will also sit and make a report on the Education department, which has been accused of delaying projects. The speaker said no stone will be left unturned.The suspension of House business comes amid uproar from the public, blaming the assembly for doing nothing the rivalry between Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko and former Likoni MP Suleiman Shakombo played out on Saturday as their booing and jeering supporters nearly stopped a fundraiser.Their supporters tried to outdo each other in a shouting match, disrupting the event and forcing Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to intervene.The two political rivals were attending a fundraiser in aid of Onagi Youth Group at Ujamaa playing ground in Likoni.Both are eyeing the Likoni MP seat on the ODM ticket.A similar confrontation between Mboko and Shakombo took place two months ago at a funds drive at Mtongwe Girls Secondary School, Likoni constituency.Shakombo had to plead with Mboko Mboko, Shakombo s backers in shout fest to be allowed to speak about projects he had initiated in Likoni.He was jeered and booed by the crowd, but he decided to put up a brave face throughout his speech.Top ODM officials are said to have endorsed Mboko for the Likoni seat at the discomfort of Shakombo and his distraught followers.ODM director of election and SunaEast MP Junet Mohamed has said Mboko is the party s choice.He dismissed Shakombo and branded him a council of elder .But even as the director of elections assured Mboko of party s support to clinch the party nominations and the seat, Joho said fair primaries must be conducted.Mboko, however, told Shakombo to stop being a joyrider on functions she has organised. I will not support Shakombo s bid to reclaim the seat because he is not sincere. Thing as the county loses millions of shillings in dubious dealings. Today, the assembly committee of the whole house chaired by the speaker will question 10 officials suspended after their passwords were used in irregularities involving Sh51 million. We have 23 committees, which have been carrying out various investigations in different departments. We want to give them time to make their reports and table them. From Thursday to Saturday the Committee on Education will make its report on the investigations over the unspent Sh1.2 billion in the Education department, Kahindi said.The report will be tabled on Monday or Tuesday next week, he aid.During last week s sitting, the assembly expressed fears that more cash could have been lost. It is shocking that a company gets a tender to build a classroom but the money is paid to a totally different company. This is laxity from the Finance department, we must have it streamlined or we will continue losing money, Jilore MCA Daniel Chai said.The assembly is also expected to summon managers of banks where the money was wired and withdrawn without their raising an alarm. This could be a big chain, because there must be someone who physically walked into the bank to withdraw the money. The law says you cannot walk into a bank and withdraw more than Sh1 million without the bank raising the red flag, Kahindi said.
