The Group has made substantial investments in Africa in the last year, and Africa is now at the front of the queue for future investments,&rdquo; Manjang said.The relocation of the Shared Service Centre operations will enable clients in Africa to benefit from centralised processing in the global processing facility, the bank said. The first phase will involve the migration of support activities for Standard Chartered Bank subsidiaries, excluding Kenya, that are hubbed to the Shared Service Centre in Nairobi which has around 300 staff. "Efforts are ongoing to absorb some of the staff into other areas within the Bank. For those that will not be redeployed, a redundancy exercise will be carried out in line with local labour laws," Manjang said.
