The Luhya should work with Jubilee and vote for the new party next year for more development in the region, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said.The community has rallied its support behind the opposition for years and should now change direction and join the government, he added. This region didn t vote for Jubilee, but at least we are getting development projects from President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. If we had voted for the government, we would be seeing more than what we are getting today, Lusaka said on Saturday.He spoke in Matungu, Kakamega county, during a funds drive for women s groups. Lusaka said Jubilee will register more members at the grassroots.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said, People of Western are changing their minds and focussing on development. The majority of MPs in the region are working with the ruling coalition and this is an indicator that the party is penetrating the region.
