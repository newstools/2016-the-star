The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority has questioned the National Irrigation Board s Sh1 billion projects in Turkana, saying they were procured without following the law.Residents say works are incomplete, posing enviornmental and health hazards to the community and livestock.In its report to the National Assembly Public Investments Committee, the authority says some information provided by the board is not objective and there are no preliminary, technical and evaluation criteria to justify award of tenders.The report calls this a violation of the law. For instance, in Kalemnyang Irrigation Development Scheme (Sh93 million), the technical evaluation score to determine capacity of the contractor to undertake the project and the technical evaluation requirement had no scoring criteria.The report also indicates the contractor did not meet the requirement as it did not provide a valid trading licence as required by law. None of the three bidders, who passed preliminary requirement, met the detailed technical requirement.....and therefore, objectively, they would not have qualified to proceed to the next stage, the report states.The multi-million projects are inNadapal (Sh64 million), Kalemnyang (Sh147 million), Katilu (Sh61.4 million), Kabulokor (Sh59.2 million), Morulem (Sh106 million) and Loborot (Sh64 million).Others are Kolyoro (Sh64 million), Turkwel (Sh70 million), Nadoto (Sh80 million), Naoros (Sh77.7 million), Naremit (Sh48.4 million), Nakamane (Sh49.7 million) and Lokipelot (Sh59.8 million).The report shows that in some instances, the NIB tender committee would make an upward revision of the contract sum in the procurement plans without amending the plan itself. Evaluation reports were also not availed to the authority as it looked into the matter, despite a request being made in good time.The committee chaired by Eldas MP Adan Keynan is investigating a petition by Turkana residents over claims NIB, had abandoned the projects. NIB general manager Daniel Baraza was suspended in April this year over claims of gross misconduct.
