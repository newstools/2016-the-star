A man was found 'making love' to a neighbour's female goat in Kabuchai constituency, Bungoma county, in the wee hours of Friday night.Goat owner Richard Wanyonyi said he caught Gabrielle Simiyu, 26, in action when he checked the shed at his Nangwe village home after hearing noises.''I thought my animals were strangling each other so I tiptoed to the cow shed and flashed my torch. I was shocked when I found the man but he ran away very fast," said Wanyonyi.''Since it was at night I did not see him very well so I took the shoes he left behind and began a search in the morning."Wanyonyi said he spoke to boda boda operators who worked with SImiyu at a nearby stage and was informed that the shoes belonged to him.He said the man admitted having sex with the animal and pleaded for forgiveness.The goat owner said Simiyu told him he committed bestiality after returning from a funeral dance as women there turned down his advances.Simiyu denied claims by some residents that he had done so before with a cow and a chicken."I have a serious problem and need help. Every time I approach a girl she refuses and it really pains me," he said.''I am appealing to well-wishers to take me to a doctor or a specialist so the problem I have can be identified."Resident Christopher Kundu said they were shocked by the incident and that they suspected the man was under the influence of drugs.But Kundu said other drug users do not commit such acts simply because they cannot pick up women. He said Simiyu could have left the funeral with any woman instead of embarrassing the community.The resident asked Simiyu's parents to take his condition seriously and find help.The man's friend named Evans Wasike said they spent time with a lot of women at the dance.Simiyu was taken to Nalondo police station where officers said they launched investigations and that he will be charged with committing the offence of bestiality.
