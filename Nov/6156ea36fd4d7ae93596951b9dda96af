Bungoma senator and 2017 presidential hopeful Moses Wetangula has been asked to first unite the Luhya and Bukusu community in western region before going for the top seat.East and Central African king of Abamasaba Bob Mushikori appealed to Wetang'ula to ensure the community unites behind one candidate in the 2017 general election.He told a meeting at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre in Bungoma that once the Bukusu and Abamasaba communities are united, it will be easier for a Bukusu leader to ascend to power. "I haven't met or heard from Moses Wetang'ula, where is he? I only hear that he wants to be the president. My son, don t rush to power, unite our community first then let's move together. United we prosper, divided we fall," Mushikori said on Thursday.Trans Nzoia governor Patrick Khaemba accused the Bukusu community leaders of fighting amongst themselves, and being fond of backstabbing ambitious people."Infighting and backstabbing amongst our leaders is the Bukusu's greatest undoing. I hope we will change and foster unity among us after this meeting," Khaemba said.He called on all Bukusu leaders to unite and speak in one language so that they can benefit from the many opportunities offered by the government of the day."Political differences should not divide us from seeking what can be beneficial to all of us," he said.Richard Walukano, a Bukusu council of elders official, said the conference was meant to unite all Bukusu leaders and ask them to forge ahead together as a community."Despite the political inclinations, we should remember that we are a people from the same mother," Walukano said.Walukano noted that Bukusu community has not enjoyed any meaningful development in the region because of the political divisions.Retired ACK church Arch Bishop Eliud Wabukala asked religious leaders to be on the forefront preaching unity among Kenyans."Peace and unity is paramount and it should be preached by all religious leaders if we need to realise development in the country," said Wabukala.Bungoma culture CEC Grace Khayota asked all the Bukusu community to preserve their culture and prevent early pregnancies among the teens.Read: Kalonzo, Wetang'ula are qualified but Raila is best for Kenya, says Wangalwa
