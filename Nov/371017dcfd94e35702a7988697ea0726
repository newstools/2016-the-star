Politician Jackson Kibor, who has filed for divorce, plans to sell 200 acres to Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, his wife Josephine Jepkoech has said. She told an Eldoret court she placed a caveat blocking the sale so her family would not be displaced. Kibor owns an 800-acre farm at Kipkabus, Ainabkoi. He wants to end his marriage of 51 years with Josephine, who is his second wife, accusing her of desertion, cruelty and interfering with his ownership of the land. &ldquo;I will still sell the land because it&rsquo;s mine and no one can tell me how to use it. I bought it at the age of 29, when I had not even married Josephine,&rdquo; Kibor told the court. Josephine says Kibor threatened her with divorce after she refused to allow him to sale 200 acres. &ldquo;We have no differences with him to warrant the divorce,&rdquo; she told the court. Hearing will continue of November 25.
