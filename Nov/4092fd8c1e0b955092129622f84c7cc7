Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa has reported receiving threats from politicians in the county, whom he did not name, for the last two months.Ragwa told journalists at Marimanti on Monday that he has recorded statements with police.&ldquo;People were sent to eliminate the Deputy Governor at his home. We have received text messages from senior politicians in the county saying we will be in Kamiti by 2017. Others say we will not survive the next two months," he said.&ldquo;When senior politicians start talking about eliminating us from the ballot we wonder what they know. Some have said that if we will be in the ballot we will end up in Kamiti, even if we get elected."He spoke after attending a fund raiser at Marimanti Catholic Church on Sunday.But the Governor refused to show the journalists the messages he was allegedly sent and to name the station at which he recorded the statements.He said the matter was sensitive and under investigation by DCI officers.Ragwa further said some people were planning to malign his name and that of Deputy Governor Eliud Mureithi but that they will not succeed.&ldquo;People want to see us eliminated from this world or imprisoned for their own reasons but that will not put us down,&rdquo; he said.The Governor said that when DP Ruto visited Maara constituency, one of his supporters was hit on head while another was clobbered in Chuka town.He said the attacks were carried out so he can give up his bid for re-election in the August 8, 2017 general election.Ragwa said he met police officers to discuss heightened security for them, and that they will move to court over the matter.
