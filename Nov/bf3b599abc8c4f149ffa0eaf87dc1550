The government has accused some hoteliers at the South Coast of withholding data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.Kwale first assistant county commissioner Kenneth Gitonga on Friday said out of 28 tourist hotels, only 17 cooperated with KNBS officials. He said KNBS officials had difficulties accessing some of the hotels to collect data. Gitonga spoke in Baraza Park, Kwale, during celebrations to mark African Statistics Day.He said it is unfortunate for popular tourist hotels to withhold data needed for planning. We urge such hotels to cooperate because nothing will be revealed to the public about their business secrets, Gitonga said. Individuals and institutions should cooperate when approached by government officials. The hotels are expected to provide data on their operations and bed occupancy, but some apparently felt information about their businesses may be made public.The Statistics Act states the bureau cannot publish or release any statistics that could disclose information about an identifiable business without its written consent.Gitonga said some residents refuse to cooperate with the officials, especially those with children living with disability. Listing of children living with disability is frustrated by some parents who hide them, he said. Gitonga said statistics is very important in planning for socioeconomic development. County Statistics Officer Alex Munga urged residents to cooperate.
