Bomet governor Isaac Rutto's supporters have lined up activities to accord the county boss a rousing welcome upon his return at JKIA from South Africa on Friday.Rutto went to SA for specialised treatment after he was hit and injured in the eye by a tear gas cannister at Silibwet Stadium.Police fired the gas to disperse rowdy boda boda riders demanding the release of youths arrested for causing chaos during a football match in the county.The governor is expected to travel by road from Nairobi to Bomet via Narok on Saturday.He is also scheduled to attend a joint prayer service organised by various churches at Bomet Stadium on Sunday."I am coming back home with an agenda of challenging the national government to review police brutality on helpless Kenyans," he told the Star on telephone from SA.He said such actions of the police against those trying to question the government were colonial and outdated.Read: Rutto leaves for treatment in SA after tear gas canister assaultDavid Rotich, Kericho county Chama Cha Mashinani coordinator, told the press that plans to welcome the governor at JKIA as well as the Sunday prayers had been finalised.Rotich urged Kericho and Bomet residents to turn up in large numbers to welcome the governor both in Nairobi and Bomet upon his arrival.
