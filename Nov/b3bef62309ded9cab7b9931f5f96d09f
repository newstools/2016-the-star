The Betting Control and Licensing Board is on the spot over irregular licensing.Lucky Bet, Advanced Innovations, and Rambo Resources have retained their licences while all others have been revoked.BCLB Director Charles Wambia has said that the board and security agencies will continue with the crackdown on illegally gambling machines across the country. We are not giving permits to anyone unless we inspect and are satisfied that the environment they operate in is ideal for gambling, Wambia said.He was, however, unable to give reasons the three were allowed to operate despite the government announcing a war on gambling machines, which are a security threat and a recipe for gambling addiction among the youth. County Commissioners have in the past month impounded gaming machines.
