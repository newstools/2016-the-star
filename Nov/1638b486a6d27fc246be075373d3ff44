Two female teachers from Marani subcounty were charged yesterday in a Kisii court with conducting illegal holiday tuition. The court heard that Zipporah Kerubo and Lydia Nyaboke committed the offence on November 15 at Gesieka Academy, contrary to the Basic Education Act 2013. Kerubo and Nyaboke denied the charges before chief magistrate Jesse Nyaga. They were released on a Sh7,000 cash bail each. The case will be heard on January 5 next year. Meanwhile, the Kenya National Union of Teachers and the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers said they want teachers treated fairly. Kisii county Knut secretary Joseph Makabe, treasurer Albert Ondimu, chairman Makori Ayega and Kuppet&rsquo;s Omari Albert and chairman Okondo Osoro said unless the Education ministry stops intimidating and harassing teachers invigilating KCSE exams, they might call for a boycott.
