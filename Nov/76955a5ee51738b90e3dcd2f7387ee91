Boda boda operators in Nairobi say they will appeal a court ruling that gave City Hall the go-ahead to remove them from the CBD. On Monday last week, Justice Joseph Onguto ruled in favour of City Hall, saying the operators had not proved to the court that the county violated their rights, as they had argued, when it banned them from the CBD.
