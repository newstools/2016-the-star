Murang&rsquo;a county could become dry by 2035 because of massive abstraction by the Northern Water Collector Tunnel, a new study indicates.Researchers say the state underestimated the county&rsquo;s current and long-term water needs when planning the Sh6.8 billion project. They want it stopped or modified.&ldquo;The Athi Water Services Board used a static allocation formula and very low growth rate for residents, agriculture and industry,&rdquo; Paul Kimani, a US-based Kenyan civil engineer, told the Star when he released a commentary to an earlier study done by the Murang'a government. Kimani is allied to saveaberdaresrivers.org, a local conservation group.He said the AWSB misled Kenyans the tunnel would mainly tap flood waters. &ldquo;The rivers flood only for a short time during two rainy seasons. If the intention is to withdraw flood flow, tunnels could be shut down for four-six months a year, when water is needed the most in Nairobi Metropolitan area. Does this make economic or environmental sense?&rdquo; Kimani asked.He said towns like Maragua and Kenol are growing rapidly and have no reliable water supply. &ldquo;If the project is implemented, the county will run out of water by 2035,&rdquo; the study says. Phase-I is underway, completion is expected in 2018.The project will convey 140 million litres daily from the Maragua, Irati and Gikigie rivers into Ndakaini Dam in Murang&rsquo;a and eventually to Nairobi. Three more phases follow.A study commissioned by the Murang&rsquo;a in April last year opposed the project in its current form.It said asserting the tunnel would only tap floods was &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;. It said Nairobi should recover the 162 million litres of water it loses daily, which it called equivalent to the tunnel supply. It said Murang&rsquo;a will lose Sh2.3 billion in value-added water a year in in opportunity costs foregone.
