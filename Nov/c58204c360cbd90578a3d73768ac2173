Kakamega governor aspirant Amukowa Anangwe has asked the government to consider disbanding the GSU after claims their officers have perpetrated violence.Anangwe said the officers have gotten into the habit of misbehaving when they are deployed to deal with insecurity matters.He noted Kenya is a democracy with a progressive constitution on matters of human rights, and respect for rule of law. It is high time the government considered disbanding the unit since it is no longer desirable," he said in a statement on Monday.He added that the GSU has proven, time and again, that it is unable to adjust to a democratic political order.Anangwe further asked the government to investigate Mumias residents' allegations of physical and sexual assault against the General Service Unit.Residents complained that security officers tortured them and used excessive force in operations to recover the seven rifles and 184 bullets.Some members of the public were allegedly harassed and beaten up and property destroyed as the officers ransacked houses and business premises.A female victim told the Star that officers severely injured her in the private parts using their batonsMore on this: GSU accused of beating up Mumias locals in search for stolen riflesAlso read: Police offers Sh500,000 reward for information on stolen G3 rifles in MumiasPolice halted the operations on Friday following uproar by local leaders. None of the stolen items has been recovered so far, following the raid that was the first of its kind at a police station in Western.Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi asked the government to institute a public Inquiry on police brutality against women and children in Mumias. Crime is not collective. To subject a whole community to harassment over crime by individuals is to undermine police operation orders and human rights under the constitution, he said in statement on Saturday.Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, Kakamega woman representative Rachael Ameso and Nominated Senator Daisy Kanainza demanded immediate action against officers who have brutally attacked citizens. It s shameful and primitive for officers to go on a raping and maiming spree as though guns are found between legs or skirts, said Ameso.Otuoma said police should be more worried about the violence those with the weapons could carry out. No one has the monopoly on violence. Even the government has no monopoly because there is law and order but in the absence of the law, residents will respond to its violence," he said.Read: Raila storms off Mumias rally after youths break windscreen
