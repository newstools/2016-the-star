The Uasin Gishu government is involved in a dispute with the Kenya Forest Service over the construction and annexing of part of its land to build a road to link a residential estate. The KFS on Thursday said it will not allow the county to look down on its activities. It s not right for the county to cut off part of our land, official Paul Karanja said.
