Hundreds of Mbeere South subcounty residents on Wednesday protested against a decision to allocate the Mwea Settlement Scheme to outsiders despite their having lived there for 40 years.The residents said they have developed the land to the extent of building permanent houses, planting trees, schools, churches and preparing farms. They said most of the 7,232 beneficiaries are not from the county.Led by Silus Muringe, Paul Ngau, Jerverson Njue, Michael Muringe, Pastor Boniface Kieti and Ann Muthee, the locals said only a very small percentage of the squatters have been given a share of the land.Muringe said titles have been issued but the more than 10,000 inhabitants did not benefit. If we are told to move, we have nowhere else to go. The way this land has been distributed has fanned a conflict between the two groups because we don t know where to go or what to do, Muringe said.Muringe said there was an agreement that the land adjudication sections of Wachoro, Makima, Karaba Gategi and Riakanau first be issued with titles and those who would not get a parcel and those the settlement schemes would be given land in Mwea. Embu Land executive Josphat Kithumbu said the National Land Commission and the Embu county government reached an agreement on how the land should be divided among the interested parties through an out-of-court settlement.
