Western Stima are happy with the current position four and want to take their performance to the next level come next season. Stima chairman Laban Jobita said they surpassed their target of finishing in top eight and they are happy with their position. We have surpassed our target and at this point, we will be grateful for whichever position. We may probably end up in position three depending on how we perform in our remaining match on November 19, he said. Stima hosts Kakamega Homeboys at Moi Stadium in Kisumu for their last match. They are currently placed fourth with 43 points from 29 matches. He said he is satisfied with the performance of all the players and would like to maintain them for next season. He admitted that the team had a few grey areas and will work on them before the start of the 2017 season. If only we played the first leg with the same vigour we have now, I m sure we would have been the champions but all is not lost, said Jobita. He also said he had identified a few players to beef up the squad next year.
