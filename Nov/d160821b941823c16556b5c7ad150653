Nairobi county head of parking Tom Tinega is among the 1600 employees sent on compulsory leave by City Hall on Monday.County secretary Robert Ayisi said in a statement that the county executive had resolved that all employees who have leave in excess of 60 days to rest from their duties."Nairobi City County recognises the need for employees to rest from their duties...As a result, the said staff have been asked to proceed on their annual leave with immediate effect," Ayisi said.Sources at the county headquarters said some employees have never gone on leave for more than five years.The source said several officers at City Hall do not like taking leave so as to be paid for works executed during the said days. "Some of them have accrued leave days of more than a year," the source said.Ayisi said the leave will rejuvenate the staff, give them time to attend to personal matters and promote their efficiency and dedication to work."The county further recognises that employees need to be away temporarily from their work stations to attend to other human needs," he said.
