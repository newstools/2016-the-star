The Kwale assembly has passed the Emergency Fund Bill to enable the county government spend two per cent of its budget in helping starving residents.Speaker Sammy Ruwa said anyone who misuses the funds will be fined or jailed.Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama said Kinango subcounty is the most affected and residents are selling their animals at throwaway prices or migrating to other areas to look for pasture. The other day I bought a very big goat at Sh1,200. I did not want to buy it but the owner forced me to get a meal to feed his hungry family, he said.MCAs blamed the county executive for failing to address perennial drought. Instead of digging dams for locals the county bought tractors and ploughed free of charge, but that is not helping, Mweruphe Ndoro said.MCAs said they will not allow the executive to use the emergency fund as a political tool against them.The bill has to be signed into law by Governor Salim Mvurya.Meanwhile, the national government has started distributing relief food in Kinango and Lunga Lunga.Civil society organisations and Base Titanium on Sunday also distributed food to starving residents.
