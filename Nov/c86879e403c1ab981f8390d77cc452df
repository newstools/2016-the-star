Deputy President William Ruto yesterday directed investigators to ensure culprits are apprehended in the alleged theft of Sh1.18 billion from the Kilifi government accounts.He directed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and police to speed up investigations and arrest those behind the suspected looting.Speaking in Vitengeni after opening the Godoma Technical Training Institute, Ruto said the officers involved in the theft should be held responsible.&ldquo;Every year, we give more than Sh9 billion to the Kilifi government. The first role is to make sure there is sufficient food for Kilifi people and health facilities are running well.If we hear that billions are missing from the county accounts, then we wonder why,&rdquo; the DP said.Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro and his Kilifi South counterpart Mustafa Idd urged Governor Amason Kingi to step aside to allow for investigations.Mung&rsquo;aro said the funds were stolen under the governor&rsquo;s watch and he should step aside.He said if he does not step aside, it will be hard for culprits to be apprehended.&ldquo;There is no way a junior officer will steal money without the knowledge of the governor. If Cord leader Raila Odinga is a real champion in the war on corruption, let him start with Kilifi,&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.
