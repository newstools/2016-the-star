The Kiambu government has urged county MPs to push for the upgrading of the Kiambu Level 4 Hospital to a level 5 facility.Health executive Jonah Mwangi said there is an influx of patients from neighbouring counties, and the hospital receives more than 1,000 outpatients and more than 400 inpatients daily.&ldquo;We are receiving many patients from neighbouring counties hence, exceeding our bed capacity for inpatients and also overworking nurses and doctors,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In the maternity wing it is overwhelming since mothers are sharing beds. Every day we have more than 50 normal deliveries and more than 80 Caesarian sections performed.&rdquo;Through political goodwill the hospital can be upgraded to a higher level, the infrastructure improved and increased and more staff hired to cope with the rising number of patients, Mwangi said.He spoke on Friday during the Nurse of the Month awards sponsored by the county government. Kiambu Governor William Kabogo&rsquo;s wife Philomena, who was the chief guest, said motivating nurses through the awards has improved health services.
