A judge yesterday refused to halt the prosecution of former NYS senior deputy director general Adan Harakhe and former chairman of the Ministerial Tender Committee Noor Hassan.This was despite their last-minute effort.Judge George Odunga, who handled the two separate files, said he was not in a position to issue any orders because the matter is supposed to be handled by the new anti-corruption division. I will certify this case as urgent, but I will not issue any orders because it is not before the correct division, the judge said. Odunga said the two casesraise pressing issues. I instead certify the case and direct the registry to transmit the files before the anti-corruption division for further direction, Odunga said.Their lawyer Roger Sagana said the two have been summoned and are to appear before the EACC today. They are to record statements in connection with procurement irregularities in the tender award for supply and delivery of Sh47.6 million training materialsIn his letter to the EACC, the Director of Public Prosecutions said there is sufficient evidence to charge Harakhe with abuse of office for issuing a local purchase order and authorising payment to a company listed as Blue Star Enterprises. The charges are frivolous, and the intention is only to embarrass me, Harakhe said.
