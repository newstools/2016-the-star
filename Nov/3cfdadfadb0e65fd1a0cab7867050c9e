Kenya Cooperative Creameries has announced plans to clear Sh500 million farmers debts. Managing director Nixon Sigei said the debts for milk deliveries accrued until 1999. He said KCC is currently compiling the payment schedule after receiving the money from the government. Sigei said records indicate 150,000 farmers are owed money. It has been a concern to all of us, more so to the Jubilee government farmers had lost hope but I assure them all is now well, he said. Sigei said the firm is investing Sh400 million to modernise its Eldoret factory and process more milk. We want to increase the production and upgrade the Long Life unit and powder facility for the strategic food reserves, he said. Sigei announced plans to make KCC more vibrant to meet the current market demands. He spoke at Kaptel market in Chesumei constituency on Sunday, when he accompanied Agriculture CS Willy Bett.
