Nandi county assembly has summoned Health executive Mathew Rotich (pictured) over the hiring of a quack doctor. Rotich told the assembly that Ronald Melly was among 103 doctors posted to the county by the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee in April. Melly has been working at Maraba Subdistrict Hospital in Tinderet. It also emerged he might have forged academic papers from the University of Nairobi and Tinderet Secondary School.
