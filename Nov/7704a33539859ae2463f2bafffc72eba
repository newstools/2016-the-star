Nairobi MCAs have said that they will on Friday storm county secretary Robert Ayisi&rsquo;s office and kick him out if Governor Evans Kidero does not fire him.Led by minority leader Abdi Guyo, the MCAs accused Ayisi of belittling them and of being incompetent. Guyo yesterday said many residents do not want Ayisi in office and it is the MCAs&rsquo; job to ensure they act on the people&rsquo;s will. &ldquo;Kidero will be violating the Constitution and subverting the interests of residents if he does not relieve Ayisi of his duties,&rdquo; he said.On Tuesday last week, MCAs unanimously voted to sack Ayisi. Guyo accused Ayisi of falsely trying to label MCAs as being part of the cartels at City Hall . He said, &ldquo;Ayisi is the ring leader of cartels. He was mentioned in many audit queries.&rdquo;
