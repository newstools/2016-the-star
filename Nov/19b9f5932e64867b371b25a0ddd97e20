A Kajiado county official has accused the government of withdrawing machinery deployed for works on the Ewuaso-Mosiro road after Jubilee lost a by-election in the area on October 26.County minister for public works Dickson Ntikoisa said on Monday that the project has since stopped and the machinery removed.The roadworks were commissioned by Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki a few days to the by-election.During the launch in Kajiado West, Kariuki said the project was part of a countrywide youth empowerment programme and that the 55km road would link all the 5 wards within the constituency."It has now become clear that the project was a campaign tool to hoodwink the people of Mosiro ward so as to vote for Jubilee," Ntikoisa said.He also accused Jubilee MCAs of being a "stumbling block" to the provision of services to residents.Read: ODM wins ward by-elections in Kisii, Kajiado and Turkana as Jubilee takes Tana RiverBut Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda said the county official's claims bordered on hate speech and are mean to divert attention."This is ridiculous because as a county minister in charge of roads, Ntikoisa is misleading the public with hate rumours," he said."It is shocking because the same minister hails from Kajiado West and does not even know what is going on in his backyard," the MP added.The MP said 15 kilometres of the road has already been done.Sakuda s remarks were supported by Ewuaso-Kidong MCA, Justus Ng ossor, who said he has been witnessing the progress of the road works on daily basis."Those are ODM rumours perpetuated by a senior member of the county government. This is propaganda aimed at tarnishing the name of Jubilee government," Ng ossor said.
