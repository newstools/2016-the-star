An upsurge in violence in the CAR has hit its GDP, which is likely to grow at 4.5 per cent this year rather than 5.2 per cent as forecast in July, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday.Next year's GDP was projected at 5.0 per cent, down from an initial forecast of 5.5 per cent, while annual inflation was set to rise to 5.1 per cent this year as against an earlier forecast of 4.0 per cent, the IMF said in a statement."Deterioration in the security environment ... took a toll on economic activity," said the IMF's Samir Jahjah at the end of a mission to the country for a first review of a $115.8 million three-year loan facility agreed in July.Clashes between militia groups in late October killed 25 people, including six gendarmes caught in an ambush.The country has been plagued by inter-religious and inter-communal conflict since 2013 when the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, prompting reprisals from the anti-Balaka militia, many of whose fighters are nominally Christian.The level of violence fell after an election in February that brought President Faustin-Archange Touad&eacute;ra to power but rose again in October.
