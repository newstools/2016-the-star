Kenya s number one amateur golfer Kenneth Bollo is the main challenger in Manchester Salver golf tournament tomorrow at the Eldoret Club.The event will mark the 17th meeting of Golfer of the Year series.The Mediheal Group of Hospitals-sponsored event has also attracted other big names. Bollo, a Royal Club golfer, is currently leading the standing with 302 points from the last 16 meetings. I am really looking forward to the event in Eldoret and I hope for the best. I have worked on swings for better results, he said. He is not new at the Eldoret golf course having played here three times including last year in the same event. I know the field will be very competitive since we have other top golfers coming, he noted.He said he expects the likes of Nandwa Alfred, Kubwa Jeff and Owiti Robinson who know course very well to pose a great challenge. Bollo is paired with the reigning Goty champion John Karichu, Alfred Nandwa and second best Jeff Kubwa.Nandwa has, however, tipped Bollo to carry the day. Based on his current form, he is the main challenger but me too and other golfers have been using different tournaments to practice, said Nandwa, who recently won the East Africa Golf Challenge in Ethiopia. Nandwa is ranked third with 192 points while Muthaiga s Jeff Kubwa is second with 185 points.
