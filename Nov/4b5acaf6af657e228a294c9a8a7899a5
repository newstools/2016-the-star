The Public Service ministry has drafted a bill to provide a self-regulating mechanism for the secretarial profession.The bill, if enacted, will be the first law to regulate the profession since Independence. The Kenya Secretaries Bill 2016 still awaits Cabinet approval before being forwarded to Parliament.Public Service PS Lilian Omollo said the new law could be in place in April next year. The new law will provide mechanisms for regulation of training, promotion and labour issues, she said.Omollo spoke on Thursday last week at the Kenya National Secretaries Association conference in Kakamega.She said secretaries and office administrators are a forgotten lot in terms of promotions and CBA agreements.The bill also establishes a board to supervise and control training standards, continuing education, accreditation and discipline of secretarial professionals.
