Deputy President William Ruto still has a strong political clout in the Rift Valley, despite some politicians from the region ganging up against him, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso has said.Laboso yesterday said the Kalenjin community is firmly in Jubilee and fully supports the DP as their leader, adding residents cannot afford to be locked out of the ruling party.She said despite some individuals fighting for Ruto s downfall, he has a strong grip on the region and the community is yet to shift its allegiance to another centre of power. Laboso said the media paints a wrong picture that the DP is losing his support base.The Sotik MP said the absence of politicians from the region during a recent homecoming party for Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto held in the Bomet Stadium was a clear indication the community is fully in the Jubilee Party. If it is true the community is no longer in Jubilee, then you should have seen all leaders from this region in that meeting. Only the usual figures who have all been opposing the DP attended. That is a show people are in Jubilee, she told the Star.Laboso has been selected to head the Jubilee campaigns in the region. She said the recently formed Chama cha Mashinani fronted by Rutto is like a passing wind and residents should not be shaken about it.
