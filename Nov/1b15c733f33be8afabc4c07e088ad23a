Kenyan rappers Khaligraph Jones, Juliani and King Kaka will be in performance this Saturday at the Alchemist in Westlands, Nairobi.Their performance will form part of the Honest Intention Organisation's fourth anniversary celebrations.The non-profit body was founded due to the founders passion for enhancing the education levels in Kenya. This was cultivated from the disappointing illiteracy levels of more than 30 per cent in Kenya and the poor quality of education received especially in the slums.Says the organisation's founder Gakii Biriri: "We believe that empowerment of the mind, academically or otherwise, is key in the achievement of the benefits of sustainable development in society."We are seeking organisations or individuals that can partner with us in cash or in kind to improve learning in schools."At the event, whose proceeds will go towards improving education mainly in the Kenyan slums, will be emceed by DJ Stretch.
