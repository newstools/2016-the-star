Two elephants in the Amboseli ecosystem have been fitted with tracking collars to monitor their movements and fight poaching.The collars transmit a satellite and radio signal using Global Positioning System technology to map their migratory routes and identify how extensively they travel in search of water and vegetation.Applying new technologies gives wildlife managers an edge over poachers and human-elephant conflict, which is increasingly critical to the conservation of elephant in the Amboseli ecosystem.International Fund for Animal Welfare chief executive Azzedine Downes said elephants need space and resources to be free, viable and to fulfil the role they play in the environment. The information we gather will give us an elephant s eye view of optimum lifestyle, he said.The technology will also improve elephant law enforcement, through immobility alerts and geo-fencing.
