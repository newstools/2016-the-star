Commonwealth Games marathon champion Flomena Cheyech will lead compatriot Monica Jepkoech at the second Saitama Marathon set for Sunday in Japan.The marathon, which will be celebrating its second edition, features a women only race with Ethiopian Baysa Atsede, the winner from last year.Cheyech, who won the full marathon at the 2014 Glasgow show is the second fastest in the list of elite runners invited with a personal best time of 2:22:44 clocked while winning the 2014 Paris Marathon.Ethiopian Gobena Amane headlines the list with a time of 2:21:51 clocked earlier this year while finishing second at the Tokyo Marathon.The race will see the return of Yoshida Kaori, who finished second last year, seeking to capitalise on her knowledge of the course in the absence of Atsede and bronze winner Rebecca Kangogo.In their absence, decorated Habtamu Atsede (2:24:25), Jepkoech (2:27:26), Maryna Damantsevich (2:30:07), Deborah Toniolo (2:31:20) and Australian Cassie Fien (2:33:36) will be gunning for the honours.Cheyech, who is based in Japan, ran her first 42km race at the 2006 Nairobi Marathon, placing seventh in a time of 2:42:31.She took a lengthy break of the longer version, concentrating on track and road races and half marathons, returning in 2012 with a win at the Porto Alegre marathon with a best of 2:34:13 and then second at the Singapore Marathon.Her breakthrough came at the 2013 Vienna Marathon, where she won in 2:24:34, nearly ten-minute improvement on the previous year before winning the Toronto Waterfront Marathon later that year. Winning the high profile Paris Marathon with a new personal best of 2:22:44 in 2014 earned her a slot in the Team Kenya to the 2014 Commonwealth Games, where she won her first championship.
