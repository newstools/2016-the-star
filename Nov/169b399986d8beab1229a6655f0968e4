The Kisii government has opened Sh40 million Intensive Care and High Dependency units at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital.Kisii Governor James Ongwae on Tuesday said with the units in place, residents will not have to travel long distances for these health services.Ongwae said his administration has already trained 10 health workers to run the units. We are going to train more health workers and increase their number to 25, he said. We have today marked a milestone in healthcare in launching the units. The governor urged residents to seek referral services at the hospital. We no longer refer many patients to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital or the Kenyatta National Hospital. Most of the illnesses can be handled locally, Ongwae said.He also opened a pharmacy at the facility. Ongwae said it will be equipped to improve supply and delivery of drugs to the county s health facilities. He was accompanied by Health executive Sarah Omache and speaker Kerosi Ondieki.In June, Ongwae said 65 doctors had been deployed to subcounty hospitals.He said hospitals in Nyamache, Gucha, Gesusu and Keumbu would have a minimum of six doctors each.
