The Nyeri county government paid all its staff Sh30 million leave allowance for two months, but there are no supporting documents, a national audit on the counties shows.The Auditor General has revealed Sh30,068,506 was paid as leave allowance to all staff in December 2014 and February 2015, but no approved leave forms were provided for audit review.&ldquo;Further, the possibility of all officers proceeding on annual leave concurrently in one month is untenable. The payment was therefore unjustified and was paid contrary to the code of regulations.&rdquo;This is one of the queries that has made the Auditor General conclude that Nyeri county may have misused 47 per cent of all its funds in 2014-15.Nyeri county provided the Auditor General with an expenditure of Sh2.3 billion in the 2014-15 financial year that was unsupported with the relevant schedules and ledger.The Auditor General reports that due to the significance of the unsupported amount, his office is unable to state whether 47 per cent of total county funding was used effectively and in a lawful manner.The audit also revealed that the Nyeri Deputy Governor got an owner occupier house allowance of Sh2.5 million, while he does not qualify for a house benefit under the law.The audit revealed there was an imprest balance of Sh9.2 million, yet the statement of assets provided by the county government showed Sh5.8 million. The report also said the county did not disclose how much it received from rent and rates, thus not complying with the laws on the county governments&rsquo; financial reporting. The county treasury did not post the Sh4.1 billion received from the Exchequer or any other money up to Sh888.1 million from own generated funds and transfers from other government entities.
