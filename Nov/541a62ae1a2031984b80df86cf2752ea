Kenya Ports Authority women s basketball team start residential training today at the Bandari College ahead of the FIBA Africa club championships starting on November 25 in Maputo, Mozambique.KPA women, won Africa Zone Five Club Championships in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania last month, are seeking to improve on their last year s performance at this year s final tour which brings together top clubs in the continent.KPA sports officer, Lenox Safari, yesterday said preparations for the event are in top gear with the team tentatively expected to depart for Maputo on November 23. We have been to this event more than any other Kenyan club and I believe we have come of age and can to take on any team in the continent, said Safari.Safari said KPA experience will come in handy, considering all but two of the players in the team have played for the national team at one point or the other. We have the best players in the country and an equally experienced technical bench which makes me believe sky is the limit, he said.Safari, himself a former Bandari and international goalkeeper, said he has retained all but two of the players, who did duty at the FIBA Zone 5 championships in Tanzania and had only strengthened the week areas to make the squad solid.The player, he said will be training twice a week at the Makande gymnasium in Mombasa and will travel straight to Maputo. He said the climate in Maputo is similar to that of Mombasa and he hopes it will favour them. Currently we will have sixteen players in training but will reduce the squad to the travelling 12 two days before the trip, he said.
