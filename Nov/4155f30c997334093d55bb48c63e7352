Kiambu residents have penned down their signatures to push for upgrading of Kiambu Hospital into a level-five facility so it can have more and better medical equipment, medicine and personnel.Led by Tinganga MCA Lawrence Mwaura, they petitioned their county assembly on Thursday, saying the entire county has only one level-five hospital in Thika subcounty. The residents say residents of the remaining 11 subcounties are inconvenienced when seeking healthcare. We have Thika Level-Five Hospital in a county of 12 subcounties. Residents of the other subcounties have been inconvenienced while in need of referral services due to the long distance and financial costs involved, the petition reads.The petition says Kiambu Hospital is overwhelmed, as it serves patients from neighbouring counties such as Nairobi. Despite the high number of patients, the hospital s equipment and resources have not changed. It s constrained, the residents say. The assembly will examine the petition. It will send it to the National Assembly and then to the Senate for ratification to compel the Health department to upgrade it, Mwaura said.
