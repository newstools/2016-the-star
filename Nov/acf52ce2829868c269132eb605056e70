The Controller of Budget wants Kisumu MCAs to amend the County Education Fund Act 2014 as it violates the Constitution.The office wants the Act amended to conform to the provision of the County Government Act 2012.Waweru Tuti from the budget controller&rsquo;s office says the Act violates the principle of separation of powers.He sent the letter dated September 22 to Planning executive George Ongaya.The office said the law provides for the MCAs to be the patrons of the Ward Education and Bursary Committee and that the governor consults the MCAs in appointing members.Tuti said the Act should also be amended to conform to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act in regard to the Administrator of the Fund.He said the Act neither makes provision for the appointment of the administrator nor provides for his functions.&ldquo;The law on public finance provides that the Finance executive designates the administration of the fund and clearly states the duties,&rdquo; the letter says.Schools open in January and the bursary should be awarded before January 4. Members expressed fear that if the Act is amended, a lot of authority shall be vested in the executive and ward administrators may misuse the powers. Kaloleni MCA Prisca Misachi said the budget controller is trying to take over their duties, adding that Agnes Odhiambo is controlling their legislation.
