The National Youth Service scandal becomes increasingly strange.What has come out of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee hearings on the theft of at least Sh1.6 billion from the NYS indicates there were players who have not been probed, taken to court or even named. When she appeared before the PAC, former Ministry of Devolution and Planning CS Anne Waiguru spoke darkly of puppets in the public domain and puppeteers behind the scenes in the NYS affair. She did not elaborate. It is still up to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions to get to the bottom of this terrible case and take watertight cases to the Judiciary. One suspect claimed to have lugged 54kg of multiple-billion-shilling high denomination notes from a bank into a car and not attracted attention to herself, presumably not even CCTV or the CBK. Full disclosure will only come with a widening of the DCI dragnet and an intensifying of investigations.
