The widow of slain Kiru Boys High School principal Solomon Mwangi has been charged with murder and rearrested after a brief taste of freedom.Jane Muthoni, a school principal herself, was arrested on November 13, shortly after police found her husband s body at Karuntuma Coffee Estate in Witeithie, Kiambu county. The body was mutilated, with his hands tied and some of his teeth missing.Muthoni was charged with murder on Tuesday, shortly after her release from custody on Sh200,000 bail. The police had sought to hold her for another 14 days to complete investigations. But principal magistrate Anthony Mwicigi said there were insufficient grounds to hold her that long.The magistrate said police had already held Muthoni for 10 days and it would be unfair to detain her for a further 14 days.Muthoni paid the cash bail, but was rearrested shortly after and charged by Justice Hatari Waweru.Waweru ordered a mental assessment for Muthoni and remand at the Murang a Prisons to allow police to take her fingerprints. Muthoni was held at Muthaiga police station after the case was taken over last week by the Homicide Unit at the DCI headquarters.
