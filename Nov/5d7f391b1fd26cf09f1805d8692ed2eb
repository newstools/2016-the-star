Jubilee&rsquo;s attempts to paint the county chiefs in the opposition as corrupt will flop, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said.&ldquo;There are wide schemes by government operatives to revive dubious cases implicating Cord governors so they can get an upper hand in the polls. We are aware of these moves to soil our names with negative propaganda and we will not allow it,&rdquo; he said.Ojaamong spoke to the press on Saturday after witnessing the ordination of priests and deacons at St Cajetan Sirimba Primary School in Bunyala North ward.He denied claims by some Jubilee leaders that Cord co-principal Raila Odinga only focusses on criticising the government.Everyone should fight graft.&ldquo;The role of fighting corruption is vested in the Attorney General, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, not the opposition leader,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.&ldquo;Raila&rsquo;s role as envisaged in the Constitution is to ensure there is freedom of speech and association and transparency, accountability and good governance at all levels of government. What Jubilee is trying to portray him as is untrue. Those are just sideshows and are doomed to fail.&rdquo;Raila has been grappling with accusations that he attacks the Jubilee administration for corruption but defends Cord governors whose spending of public funds is in question.
