The effects of a Donald Trump victory have been devastating for millions of Americans, even for small children who have no idea what in the world is going on in their country.A shocking video that emerged on Friday, shows how horrifying those effects are becoming,when a Texas mother kicked her young son out of their home after he 'voted' for Trump in a mock election at school, according to TMZ.The child screamed in horror as his mother showed him the door, where she left a small suitcase packed with all of his belongings.'Since you voted for Donald Trump. You can get your sh** and get out,' his mother told him as they stood in front of their door.As the child started crying and pleading with his mother, she told him to take his sign.'So when the people see you outside, they know why you're standing out there,' she yells.The child then sits on the floor as she held up a cardboard sign waiting for him to take it.As the horrified child takes the sign, she directs him to the door.'You wanna vote for him, I'm going to show ya,' she says as she unlocks their door.She is heard saying: 'Get your suitcase and get out! We don't do Donald Trump here.'The mother then slams the door after forcing the crying child outside.In the video, the child is seen pulling the suitcase as he walks past their driveway and stands on the sidewalk holding his sign.'Bye Donald Trump lover,' the mother says.The child responds: 'But I got school tomorrow.'His mother replies: 'Well you should have thought about that.'As the little boy stood on the sidewalk, his mother asked: 'Why did you vote for him at school?'The child said: 'Because I see him on TV a lot.'She then walks away and tells the child he can't come home as his little brother starts to cry and yells that he wants his brother.
