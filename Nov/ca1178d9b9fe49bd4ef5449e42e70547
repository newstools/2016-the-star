Property owners at the controversial multimillion Oasis Village in Malindi have dismissed claims a building with 200 luxury apartments is a deathtrap. The owners blame the conflict at the Oasis Village on their disputes with a former manager of the property. On Monday, more than 20 apartment owners at the village said they were shocked by newspaper reports that their apartments would be brought down. They said they received a notice on September 22 last year from the Kilifi government, giving them 21 days to vacate. They are yet to comply, saying the building is safe and in good condition. The notice directed the building be closed for structural integrity tests. The building has been found to be in a very hazardous state and poses a great danger to its occupants, the notice read. Panicked residents accused the former manager of trying to frustrate them , making them surrender their property. The building s ownership disputes go back several years. Many cases about it are pending in court. Oasis, according the tenants, consists of 184 units, including 172 apartments and 12 shops. They said less than 20 apartments are incomplete, while the rest are in good condition and being maintained.
