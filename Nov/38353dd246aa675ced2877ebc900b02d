Nakuru Senator James Mungai hardly says a word in the Senate. And he is silent in the Senate because most of the time he is absent, preferring instead to be in his business in Thika.When Nakuru people hear Senators Mike Sonko, Khalwale or Mutula Kilonzo Junior, Anyang Nyong o or Kimani Wamatangi speak, they miss their senator, who could be there speaking about their many problems but he is never there. Characteristically, the Senator of Nakuru does not address the County Assembly to give the MCAs his assessment of what problems or progress he believes it should address or enhance.Worst of all, the Nakuru Senator never even convenes public meetings where he can share his opinions or views with the people or simply listen to them espouse their problems to him.In short, representation of Nakuru people by Senator James Mungai in the Senate or anywhere else is simply not there and Nakuru people could simply say they have no representation anywhere.Hon. Senator James Mungai is a direct product of a propaganda campaign that was mounted to convince Nakuru people and other Kenyans that they could get better representation and service from successful businessmen and women and high profile professionals than from politicians. Hopefully, Nakuru people have now learnt that this propaganda was false and misled them into electing into Senate and national assembly persons whose representation was zero.Tragically, this propaganda succeeded in convincing people that there is virtue in silent and voiceless representation that simply means non representation and asphyxiation of democracy.By never talking in the Senate, the Senator of Nakuru has robbed Nakuru people of their voice and representation in the Senate, a robbery that is worse than that of property or anything else because it negates their vote and right of representation.Consequences of a Senator keeping quiet in the Senator are dire to the people who are robbed representation. As the Kikuyu proverb says kwa munegeni gukiura, kwa mukiri kworire tene by the time one who speaks out loses his home, the silent one will have lost his long time ago. A county without representation is bound to lose what a county with vocal representation gains which is why it is a democratic right for every county to have representation in the Senate and National Assembly.Right now because Nakuru people have no representation, there is nobody to fight for their rights in the Senate. For them, it is like the Senate does not exist at all.Without a working Senator, 44 billion shillings that Nakuru County has received from national government in the last five years have received no oversight and there is nothing to show for them on the ground.With 44 billion shillings, Nakuru county government could have achieved a lot of visible development which is not there now. And yet it is the Senator we must blame for this lack of development because he has done nothing to ensure that county funds from national government are properly protected. Instead of keeping watch over this money, the Senator has allowed billions of shillings to be spent with salaries, allowances for meetings and huge expenses for travel abroad that has nothing to show for.Indeed it is amazing that, with billions, while the County Assembly Speaker Susan Kihika travels around in a helicopter, the county government can hardly show a big hospital, a big high school, a tarmac road, a notable bridge or a big industry that it has put up to enhance development. In fact, Koigi wa Wamwere with 151 million of CDF money for five years put up 197 development projects that governor Kinuthia Mbugua cannot boast of. Where then has 44 billion shillings of county government money gone?As Senator Mungai goes to sleep, it is unfortunate that Nakuru County lacks the kind of leadership that can help to completely unite all the communities that live here with many complaining jobs and business tenders are not equitably distributed between all communities while land issues like issuance of title deeds remain largely unresolved.With what Nakuru people have learnt, they will never again elect a Senator they don t know by face, they have never seen, whose history they don t know or comes from another county, merely because he is brought to them clothed by in a party suit.
