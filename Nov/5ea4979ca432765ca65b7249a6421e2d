Maseno University was on Tuesday closed indefinitely after student unrest paralysed operations at the institution.VC Julius Nyabundi issued a memo on the closure, citing disturbance arising from the demise of one of the university's students on Monday and the subsequent unrest."Students are expected to vacate the premises of the university by 5.30pm," the memo read.Nyabundi said the institution's senate reviewed the situation and made a decision on the closure.Assistant IG Joseph Keitany said tension remains high as members of the community may be planning a revenge attack on students."The situation is not that good but we are doing all it takes to prevent any attacks and destruction of property," Keitany said."Quick Response Team has been sent for reinforcement, even though most of the officers are manning examination centres," he added.On Monday evening, students went on rampage following the killing of a third year student Maina Njoroge.More on this: Maseno University students on rampage, lynch man who killed colleagueIrate students cornered and lynched Njoroge's suspected killer Peter Nyangweso.Njoroge was found dead at the private hostel he resided in within Ong'adi village in Maseno.Keitany said the cause of the disagreement between Njoroge and Nyangweo has not yet been established.Students blocked the Kisumu-Busia road, lighting bonfires and stoning motorists, forcing police to divert motorists to avoid more confrontations.Police used tear gas to disperse the students.Students leader Fred Makajos, who was arrested at about 11am on Tuesday, was released.
