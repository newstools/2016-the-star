The government has finally agreed to pay Sh64 billion owed to the Nairobi County in accumulated debts.National Treasury CS Henry Rotich told Governor Evans Kidero that the government is ready and willing to clear the debt. All you have to do is submit the bill to my office and we take it from there, Rotich said on Wednesday.Kidero had taken on the government over the debt saying the Department of Defence had been evading to pay county authorities before and after county governments came into being.The defunct City Council of Nairobi had leased a piece of land to the Kenya Defence Forces in Embakasi.Kidero said the non-payment affected the county's effective delivery of services.More on this: Kidero to petition Senate over huge debt state owes countyThe Governor had also lamented over delayed payment for a parcel of land in Ruaraka that was taken by the national government to build houses for GSU officers.Meanwhile, the Commission on Revenue Allocation said it would end allocations of money to Nairobi county in the next five years."The county should not be still dependent on the exchequer like other counties," CRA chairman Micah Cheserem said. Cheserem was responding to Kidero who had questioned the criteria used by CRA in allocation of funds.Kidero argued that the formula used is disadvantageous to counties that have a higher population.Read: City struggles to pay Sh45bn council debtHe had lamented the "poor funding" that has made the county unable to pay the 7,000 employees it inherited from the central government with the county having accrued debts of up to Sh47 billion. Cheserem said factors that are used to determine what every county should get include the number of residents and size of the population of the county, as well as marginalisation in terms of infrastructure.They spoke during the fifth annual conference for chairpersons of the constitutional commissions and independent offices.The forum was held at the Charter Hall, City Hall.Among those present were chairpersons of constitutional commission, the Teachers Service Commission, Public Service Commission, National Police Service Commission, and the National Cohesion Integration Commission.Rotich said the government is supporting the institutions for efficient delivery of services. "The government has allocated Sh256 billion to the bodies and much of it has gone to TSC," Rotich said.
