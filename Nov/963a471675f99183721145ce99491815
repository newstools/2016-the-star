Over 500 Shabana FC supporters have petitioned Kisii County governor James Ogwae to speed up renovations at Gusii Stadium to allow the home side to use the facility.The supporters through their chairman Sammy Nyakundi said Shabana were no longer enjoying home support in Kisii since the Gusii Stadium was closed for renovation early this year.Nyakundi said Shabana have become nomads shuttling between Kericho Green stadium, Afraha and Sony Awendo grounds and this was affecting their performance.Nyakundi told governor Ogwae to treat football as any other development project by ensuring the gates to Gusii Stadium are opened to the home side. This is the only way the club can enjoy home support while playing their super league matches, he said. He told the governor to wake up and mobilize county government resources and ensure the Gusii Stadium was ready for use by Shabana FC before the end of the year. He said Shabana have what it takes to perform well in the super league as long as they have somewhere they can call home. He said football is the only popular sport in Kisii and the continued closure of the stadium will discourage the upcoming talent.
