THIS issue surrounding allegations that money obtained by fraudulent means finds a safe haven in the client's law firm account is really very complicated as it comes under what we call advocate-client confidentiality .To illustrate: If a certain man or woman gets about Sh300 million, from whatever source, and puts it in my clients' account, it would be much harder for the police or the anti-banking fraud investigators to pursue that person than if this money had been deposited in an ordinary account. This is because of advocate-client confidentiality, which would apply to this account.Main story: Murkomen, Ruto's aide got sh15 million devolution cashAnd this confidentiality is almost absolute. But there are also limitations.For instance, if the person who deposited this money in his lawyer s account sold drugs then that would be a different matter, as this confidentiality does not apply in a case where a crime has been proved to have been committed. But I emphasise that it really has to be a very strong case against the suspect, if not outright proof of crime. Mere suspicion of crime is not enough for you to come and compel advocates, for example, to tell you the sources of the money they hold in trust for their clients.Let me emphasise again that this confidentiality is limited and that one cannot hide crime within it.The question though arises whether it can only be determined that you have committed a crime after you have exhausted all the mechanisms of an appeal. For example, if you are convicted in a magistrate's court, you still have the High Court; and beyond that you have the Court of Appeal; and beyond even that, lies the Supreme Court.So the advocate-client privilege can easily hamstring proceedings when it comes to getting to the bottom of some theft or fraud.However, be that as it may, the thing that must be borne in mind is that, in the end, advocate-client confidentiality is not intended to help conceal crimes, and in the long run will not do so. But in the short-term, merely because there is an allegation of crime, an advocate cannot be compelled to disclose information about his or her client's finances, or the sources of such money, because that effectively converts him from an advocate to a witness. And that distinction has to be retained. You cannot be the advocate of the accused and simultaneously be a witness against him or her.
