Deputy President William Ruto has cautioned politicians against involving themselves on matters pertaining to the country&rsquo;s defence forces.Ruto particularly took issue with some leaders who criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta move to withdraw the Kenya&rsquo;s Defence Forces from a peacekeeping mission in South Sudan.The withdrawal of KDF followed the dismissal of Kenyan Commander of peacekeeping force in Sudan Lieutenant General Johnson Kimani Ondieki by the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon for allegedly failing to prevent civilian deaths.Speaking during an interdenominational prayer service at the Bindura Africa Inland Church Kesses Constituency, Uasin Gishu County on Sunday, Ruto told politicians to leave matters of the defence forces to the Commander in Chief.&ldquo;President Uhuru Kenyatta is the Commander in Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces and knows his role on matters of security. The President does not make decisions on the basis of political directions but on security analysis,&rdquo; said Ruto.Read : Raila chides Uhuru for pulling KDF out of S.Sudan, move driven by anger, madnessAlso read: Mudavadi terms withdrawal of troops from South Sudan as 'hasty and unwise'He said Kenya is a sovereign state where the President has a right to give direction on how security issues should be handled and does not rely on outsiders for advice on matters pertaining to security.&ldquo;Our security officers have put their lives at risk in the line of duty for the sake of the security and we should stop political insinuations on their work,&rdquo; said Ruto.&ldquo;Politicians should leave alone matters of security and concentrate on what they understand,&rdquo; added the Deputy President.Ruto was accompanied by MPs Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Isaac Melly (Uasin-Gishu), James Bett (Kesses), William Kisang (Marakwet West), Kangogo Bowen (Marakwet East), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin-Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet).

Violence is not a political tool to get anybody anywhere in this century, &ldquo;said Ruto.Ruto said the Government has done a lot in making Kenya a united and peaceful country and wondered why the Opposition was reverting to old political tactics aimed at dividing Kenyans.
