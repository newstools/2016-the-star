Athlete Daniel Komen has moved to the High Court seeking to recover money Uasin Gishu speaker Isaac Terer allegedly swindled him.Attempts by Terer s lawyers to bar the media from covering the case were rejected by the court.Komen, who won gold in 2007 Stuttgart Champion men s 1,500 metres, wants Terer s accounts frozen unless he deposits Sh12 million as part of the money he demanding. Justice Anthony Ombwayo of the High Court in Eldoret will hear the case in which Komen claims Terer conned him more than Sh21 million.The athlete said he had contracted Terer as his financial adviser and had asked the speaker to buy land on is behalf, saying he lost his money in the process."We seek to have the bank accounts of Terer and the second defendant frozen or they pay Sh12 million to the court as deposit to grant security in this case, Komen says.But Terer's lawyer Bernard Lang'at said the second defendant Paul s Cookiesman had not been served and the matter could not proceed.Lawyer Langat has argued that some of the media reports on the matter were of subjudicial nature and wanted the media locked out.Komen s lawyers in defense of the media said both parties have been quoted on the matter before the case was taken to court.The case will be mentioned on December 7.
