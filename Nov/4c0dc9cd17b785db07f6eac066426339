Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i s remarks yesterday that it is no longer business as usual in the management and marking of national examinations are most welcome (see P16). He also announced that the marking of the exams will be as rigorously scrupulous as the invigilation has been.Speaking in Bungoma town, he said the examinations integrity must not be undone at the marking stage.The exam markers will work in a phones-off and no photography environment, where contact with the outside world will be minimal and they will be under armed police guard.The 2016 national examinations will most likely be the most credible in the history of education in this country, as the CS emphasised there was no leakage whatsoever.But Kenyans must be vigilant, lest the national examinations institution goes the way of the PSV industry after the late John Michuki was moved from the Transport ministry. Clean exams done and marked with integrity need to be institutionalised.
