The government has dismissed claims of the involvement of the Chief of Staff and Head of the Public Service in the Afya House scandal.Through spokesman Eric Kiraithe, the government has said the claims were malicious. He said the report by Business Daily did not explain how Joseph Kinyua was involved in wiring the money. Kinyua was last month accused of approving Sh400 million payments to Afya House contractors.
