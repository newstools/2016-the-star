Officials have revealed that Sh51 million, not Sh45 million, has been misused and has disppeared in Kilifi county. It is suspected cartels from Ifmis, the national online payment system; five banks where money was deposited and county officials colluded to loot funds. Finance chief officer Ben Kai, senior accountant Jacob Konde and county secretary Owen Baya said a report has revealed Sh51 million disappeared from accounts. Earlier, Sh45 million had been reported missing. Treasury and Finance officials were summoned by the County Assembly Oversight Committee chaired by speaker Jimmy Kahindi. They were asked how the funds disappeared from accounts. The revelations come three days after 10 county officials were suspended in the case. They include Health chief officer Timothy Malingi and accountants Paul Mwanzo (Treasury), Jacob Konde (Health), John Kalume (Finance) and Josephine Muramba (Education). The money disappeared from the Health department. It reportedly was not tracked by required procedures. Kibarani MCA Gertrude Mbeyu dismissed the county secretaryâ€™s plea to give the suspended officers time to prepare for questioning.
