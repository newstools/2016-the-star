The Public Accounts Committee will have to call more witnesses before retreating to write its report on the Sh791 million NYS scandal.The committee was to conclude its hearings last week, but fresh details by former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru have compelled it to give those mentioned an opportunity to be heard. Appearing before the Nicholas Gumbo-led panel, Waiguru linked the scam to DP William Ruto s close allies.She named Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Ruto s aide Farouk Kibet as beneficiaries of the prodigious looting of the NYS. The grand theft is said to have increased from an initial Sh791 million to a staggering Sh1.6 billion, according to the Auditor General s special audit report.
