The ongoing quest to have Foreign CS Amina Mohammed elected to chair the AU Commission is driven by Kenya's interest to rise as the regional diplomatic powerhouse.It has not been clear why President Uhuru Kenyatta has dedicated so much resources and time to campaign for Amina across the continent.However, insiders within the Presidency have revealed to the Star that Kenya is aiming to be the voice of Africa on global matters by clinching the position."First it's instructive to note that none of the initial five candidates were able to gather votes outside their region and even in the last round the candidate filed to get the required two thirds vote. This left a picture of a divided continent and therefore Amina's candidature is meant to be a unifying candidature," one source within the Presidency said.The Presidency also believe that Amina is best placed to lead Africa's quest for more voice at the global bodies due to how she led Kenya's onslaught against the ICC.It is also the belief of State House, that Amina's experience gives her the expertise to steer the continent in its vision 2063."You see AU is about less politics and more intra-regional trade," another official from the Foreign Ministry, who was unwilling to be quoted on the matter, said.Kenya also has been selling Amina as someone who will champion trade which, it says will be an affirmation that the country's foreign policy which is Afro centric is a success.This, the Presidency believes, puts Kenya's footprint on the African map as one of the big players alongside Nigeria, South Africa and Algeria"Having a Kenyan at the helm means we sit on every negotiating table for the continent both within and without and therefore we can push our agenda globally," Ambassador Yvonne Khamati, who is part of the campaign secretariat said.She added; "We have set up a campaign secretariat in KICC with top diplomats for the campaign and till January our mandate is to ensure Kenya wins. Intellectuals and scholars. Also a full time Cabinet sub committee."A number of countries have already pledged support for Amina though in the complex AU voting system most countries are likely to take their cue from their regional groupings, such as the EAC, southern Africa s SADC, or west Africa s ECOWAS.When Uhuru met other African leaders in Morocco, he told them that Amina would hit the ground running on the most pressing peace and security issues on the continent: terrorism; civil wars; post election conflict; and stabilization."Her experience in World Trade Organization negotiations and as chair of the recent WTO Ministerial Conference will allow her to build Africa s voice in multilateral trade negotiations and agreements," Uhuru told them.As Uhuru was campaigning in Morocco, Deputy President Willliam Ruto was in Egypt where he met President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prime Minister Sherif Ismail in Cairo.Ruto and five Cabinet Secretaries - Charles Keter, Rachel Omamo, Sicily Kariuki and Mwangi Kiunjuri have been on shuttle diplomacy for two weeks.Candidates from Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Senegal and Botswana will also seek the chairperson s post when elections are held at the next African Union summit in Ethiopia in January.
