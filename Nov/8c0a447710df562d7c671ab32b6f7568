Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been challenged to give evidence linking Governor Alfred Mutua to the alleged kidnapping of Machakos Deputy Governor Benard Kiala s daughter.Machakos county majority leader Joshua Mwonga said it is shameful for a respected leader such as Kalonzo to publicly accuse the governor of kidnapping his deputy s daughter.The Masinga Central MCA spoke in his ward on Saturday.He dared the Wiper leader to record a statement with the police if he has evidence incriminating the governor.He said Kalonzo should stop defaming Mutua if he does not have any evidence against him.He added that it was not the right time to accuse and point fingers at each other. Instead, he said, it was time to join hands and find the girl. It is painful for a parent to have his or her child kidnapped, and this is the time we should sympathise with Kiala. We shouldn t be accusing each other because that doesn t help, Mwonga said.He said Mutua is not the only aspirant for Machakos governor seat in 2017 for him to be labelled a suspect in the matter. He said Kiala is not a political threat to Governor Mutua for him to stoop so low and even if he could be involved, which is unimaginable for him, to suppress his candidature.Last Friday at a political rally in Kibwezi, Kalonzo said police should question Mutua concerning the disappearance of Kiala s daughter.The deputy Governor s daughter was reportedly kidnapped on Wednesday by people Kiala claimed demanded he drops his bid for Machakos 2017 governor.
