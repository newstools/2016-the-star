The rivalry between Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko and former Likoni MP Suleiman Shakombo played out on Saturday as their booing and jeering supporters nearly stopped a fundraiser.Their supporters tried to outdo each other in a shouting match, disrupting the event and forcing Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to intervene.The two political rivals were attending a fundraiser in aid of Onagi Youth Group at Ujamaa playing ground in Likoni.Both are eyeing the Likoni MP seat on the ODM ticket.A similar confrontation between Mboko and Shakombo took place two months ago at a funds drive at Mtongwe Girls Secondary School, Likoni constituency.Shakombo had to plead with Mboko to be allowed to speak about projects he had initiated in Likoni.He was jeered and booed by the crowd, but he decided to put up a brave face throughout his speech.Top ODM officials are said to have endorsed Mboko for the Likoni seat at the discomfort of Shakombo and his distraught followers.ODM director of election and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed has said Mboko is the party s choice.He dismissed Shakombo and branded him a council of elder . But even as the director of elections assured Mboko of party s support to clinch the party nominations and the seat, Joho said fair primaries must be conducted.Mboko, however, told Shakombo to stop being a joyrider on functions she has organised. I will not support Shakombo s bid to reclaim the seat because he is not sincere.
