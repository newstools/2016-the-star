Individuals must fight corruption and not make the anti-graft war the sole responsibility of government, a community or party, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has said.He said corruption must be fought on all fronts, and those who are guilty must take responsibility for their actions. Individuals who steal are not doing so for Jubilee or their ethnic groups, but they are out to enrich themselves and their kin, Wamatangi (pictured) said in Ruiru on Sunday.He warned leaders, communities and parties against defending suspects, saying there is too much sensationalising and politicising of graft. He urged Kenyans to let authorities conduct investigations. Investigations should be given a chance to prove if allegations against individuals are true or not, Wamatangi said.He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to eliminate corrupt cartels from the government. The member of the Senate Public Accounts and Investment Committee said county corruption must also be investigated thoroughly.He urged agencies with county oversight mandate to prevent looting of funds. Devolution is at risk since reports by the Auditor General have shown illegal procurement and waste of taxpayers money, Wamatangi said.He rejected accusations by some governors that PAC is persecuting counties, saying it is mandated to ensure county resources are managed properly. We re not witch-hunting governors. The committee asks questions based on audit queries, Wamatangi said.
