It will be debated next Wednesday.The notice by Ndalani MCA Stephen Muthuka cites numerous grounds for removal, including violation of the Constitution, procurement law and County Government Act.Mutua says, however, the planned impeachment results from his refusal to fund the campaigns of MCAs, as they have demanded.The motion alleges irregular payment of Sh89 million for the desilting of Maruba Dam and contract award for construction of an access road.Muthuka says no work was done from January to February, as the country experienced el Nino and desilting of the dam could not take place.

The governor and his administration presided over illegal and irregular misappropriation of grants and transfers from Danida and World Health Organization amounting to Sh161 million to Machakos county WHO PROSPECT ACT C/A COUNTY GOVERNMENT, the motion reads.Muthuka has accused Mutua of using county funds to mount signs promoting his Maendeleo Cha Chap party.
