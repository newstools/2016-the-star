The Auditor General has, in his latest audit, questioned the expenditure of Sh86 million for renovation works and construction of a gate at the Nyamira Level 4 Hospital.Edward Ouko&#39;s report says that the Nyamira government could not justify why it used Sh2.5 billion for the construction of the gate.The report for the 2014-15 financial year adds that some Sh26 million was paid out for renovation of the mortuary, kitchen, store and plumbing works.&quot;A physical verification of the kitchen and store works revealed that flush doors were not replaced as stated in the Bill of Quantities,&quot; the report says. &quot;The three coats of bituminous paint were also not applied to the rendered are and concrete floor was not placed on the base bur instead a concrete floor was done.&quot;It adds that no documentation to confirm approval of the changes was availed for audit.The report also says plumbing works were not done to satisfaction as there were noticeable leakages with no water flowing into the taps and toilets.The Auditor General also says Nyamira may not get value for an amount of Sh226 million used to refurbish county health centres.Ouko says agreements between contractors and the county government did not set commencement dates, contract periods or completion dates.He adds that at Magwagwa Health Centre, the project was for rehabilitation and renovation of a kitchen clock but the actual work was the rehabilitation of staff quarters.This, he says, was poorly done as there were cracks on the floor.Read: Big blow for Nyamira county as MCAs reject corruption reportAlso read: Counties spent millions on wheelbarrows, FacebookWorks at Endiba Health Centre were on an existing project but the Auditor General questioned the an expenditure of Sh2 million for work not done.The report says the rehabilitation and renovation of&nbsp;Orwak Health Centre &nbsp;at Sh2.3 million was similar to a project by the CDF and World Vision on the same site.
