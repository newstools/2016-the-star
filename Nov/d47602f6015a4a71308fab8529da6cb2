Wiper has supported the prosecution of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua over the alleged fraudulent purchase of 16 motor vehicles for the county government.Secretary General Hassan Omar said the governor has been using all tools and means necessary to avoid his day in the dock. He said the governor&rsquo;s case is no longer an audit query because investigations are complete and he is slated for prosecution.Omar, who is also Mombasa senator, criticised the courts for halting Mutua&rsquo;s prosecution twice. &ldquo;That is why we have issues with the courts. They should not allow themselves to procrastinate on prosecutions as this defeats the war on corruption,&rdquo; he said in Mombasa on Saturday.Omar said Mutua has been issuing flimsy excuses to avoid prosecution.&ldquo;One day he&rsquo;s sick, one day he&rsquo;s out of the country, the last time he said there was an impeachment motion,&rdquo; he said. Omar said the Senate has the powers of the High Court and can take action.The secretary general said despite the governor being a member of Wiper they have never defended him. Omar said there is no victimisation as some of the queries raised are glaring theft.
