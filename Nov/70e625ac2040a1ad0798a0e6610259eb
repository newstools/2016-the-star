ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has termed President Uhuru Kenyatta s visit to Western last week a mockery to the Luhya community.Uhuru was in Bungoma county on Thursday to preside over Kibabii university graduation. He visited Pan Paper but remained mum on any major government project for the region.Mudavadi said that failure by the President to announce any major project for the region during his tour confirms that there is and will never be mega Jubilee projects in the area.He said Jubilee has also failed to implement and complete projects commissioned under the Grand Coalition government. Pan Paper mills may never actually open to business of producing paper. All the President is doing is making sugar-coating visits to the dead factory and raising false hopes until he gets votes next year, he said.More on this: Uhuru to open phase one of Webuye Pan Paper Mills in December"The impromptu visit was meant to save Luhya leaders following him acute embarrassment," he said.Mudavadi was speaking during a fundraiser in aid of Lwandanyi secondary school in Bungoma County on Saturday.He said it was no coincidence that Uhuru commissions mega projects in Central and Rift Valley and only make promises in Western.Mudavadi also called Uhuru and DP William Ruto out on alleged police brutality in Mumias.Residents have alleged that GSU officers have used excessive force, including torture, in an operation aimed at recovering seven G3 rifles stolen from Booker police station in the area last Wednesday."Crime is not collective and to subject a whole community to Gestapo-style policing is to undermine police operational orders and human rights under the constitution," he said.He also said there is a deliberate attempt to delay reconstituting the electoral commission to scuttle next year's elections.He asked the IEBC selection panel to come clean on whether they are working at the behest of external forces.Mudavadi said the panel owes Kenyans an explanation on the EACC's role in stopping interviews for shortlisted commission chairpersons.This is after the panel revoked two candidates citing unsuitability.More on this: IEBC selection panel revokes names of five shortlisted for chair post The procedure known to us is the panel should have sought concurrent clearance from KRA, EACC and DCI before announcing the shortlist. And if indeed only one candidate was found suitable, why not subject the person to an interview before re-advertising? he said.
