Presidential aspirant Abduba Dida has said he is the best placed leader to end corruption in the country.Dida told journalists in Mumias town on Tuesday that the country s major challenge is corruption.He also criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta s regime of failing to offer solutions to the country s ailing health, education and security sectors."Uhuru had two years after the ICC case was terminated to show us what he can do. But he has spent more time on his re-election bid," he said.The Alliance for Real Change (ARC) leader was in the region to open the party's office at Matungu, Kakamega county.Dida said it is disheartening to see money meant to benefit all Kenyans being stolen under the purview of highly connected individuals."Corruption in Kenya is growing at an alarming rate because the country lacks divine leadership," he said.Read: Elect religious president to prosper, says Dida"Those entrusted with the country s leadership do not value humanity because they neither understand what God wants from them nor do they fear God," he added.Dida said the high level of corruption in the country was the reason he rejected Uhuru offer that he serves as CDF board chair."I would have exhibited my style of leadership while in the CDF position and the President with his greedy MPs would be on my neck the following day," he said.Read: Kuppet roots for Dida s new state position Dida told Kenyans to refuse to accept corruption as their culture so that the national cake can benefit every citizen."It is shameful for Kenya that people are still dying for lack of proper medication and lack of equipment in health facilities," Dida said.He further blamed office holders under the new dispensation of lacking capacity to adjust to the realms of the new constitution.The ARC leader said he will visit all the 47 counties to step up his campaign for the presidency by opening party offices in the whole country.Dida, who shot into the limelight when he declared his bid in 2013, said he was alarmed that debt in the country was rising at uncontrollable levels."Revenue collection in the last Financial Year was below target by Sh62 billion. Management of revenue in the country is worsening with rising debts," he said.The World Bank in a report on the debt situation in Kenya posited that the external debt has increased from a low of Sh361.73 billion in May 2003 to Sh1.8 trillion as at June 2016. Dida further promised to offer solutions to the starving communities of Turkana, Eastern and other regions, adding that food security is a core pillar in his campaign.He met Muslims from Western region at the Mumias Jamia mosque and urged them to support his bid for the presidency in 2017."Dignity and honour which is missing in the country s leadership today must be revived," Dida said, further asking Kenyans to accept leaders from minority communities."Kenyans should desist from the culture of valuing people from large communities who have a lot of money from unknown sources," he said.Dida told Kenyans to consider him for president, 'or live to regret the wasted five years after 2017'.
