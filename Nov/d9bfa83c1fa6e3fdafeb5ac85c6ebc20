After more than 4,000 trips through the park over the years, I remain in awe as to the incredibly wide range and creative detail of the flora and fauna species. In fact, the more I explore and find out about the amazing diversity, the more I realise how little I actually know. It is as if every visit somehow reveals something new and exciting to me. This natural wonder is only 117sq km, a relatively small area to support such a diverse range of species. I do not think there is another place on the planet as unique as this one.People like to inquire and find answers to certain mysteries regarding life. One question often asked is: How does all this happen to be here? Two main schools of thought exist. Some people think that there was a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; millions of years ago, and then somehow, gases cooled and converged to solids and liquids, which evolved to be what they are today.Other people believe all living things are the result of a controlled creative process with great intelligence and extreme detail, that only God could achieve. I personally believe that the Nairobi National Park is an amazingly incredible creation that God has positioned right next to the city of Nairobi for the benefit of mankind. The park is a priceless treasure, a wonderful place for people to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; from the city, finding rest and peace in natural surroundings.A place where individuals and family can experience the healing &ldquo;soul tonic&rdquo; that comes to the people who spend time in nature.
