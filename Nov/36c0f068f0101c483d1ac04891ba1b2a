Samburu residents have expressed their gratitude to the Judiciary following the nomination of Justice Isaac Lenaola as judge of Supreme Court.Women representative Maison Leshoomo led the residents in appreciating the choice of Lenaola, saying it is an achievement for the community and Kenyans at large.Leshoomo said settling on Lenaola now assures the community that the government has them in mind.She further expressed satisfaction and trust in the President Uhuru Kenyatta administration, adding that many residents have promised to join Jubilee Party.In the 2013 general election, TNA got less than 50 per cent of Samburu votes, which was attributed to the area 'being forgotten by the government'."It will be a honour if the President appoints one of our sons to such a position," said Leshoomo.And the appointment is encouraging more students to pursue law courses.Julius Lengushuru, a pupil at Maralal primary school, said that he has always wanted to be a lawyer to follow in the footsteps of Justice Lenaola.Lengushuru noted that he started reading about Justice Lenaola five years ago when he was in class three."When I was in class three, I heard that Lenaola was the first Samburu to study Law. Since then, I have always wanted to be like him," said Lengushuru.Read: First Samburu ever to study lawHowever, Leshoomo noted that Justice Lenaola will not only serve the Maa community but also Kenyans from all corners of the country.She lauded Justice Lenaola is a person of integrity."Jubilee has made us proud by remembering us with the job. We will all join Jubilee and support the party. We will all vote for Uhuru Kenyatta," said Leshoomo.Raphael Lekadero, a resident, said that Lenaola's appointment has also changed the face of Samburu away from the perception that it is 'just a pastoral community'."Most of our children will now work hard in school so that they can also be like Justice Lenaola. We consider him a role model," said Lekadero.Jane Nasieku, a Kenya school of Law student, said: "He used to command a lot of respect whenever he came home, even the elders used to give him their chairs to sit on. I want to be like him,"
