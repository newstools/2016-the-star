Co-operative Bank, the country's second largest lender by market share, yesterday reported net profit in nine months through September rose 22.27 per cent on increased interest earnings amid improved efficiencies. Net earnings rose to Sh10.54 billion from Sh8.62 billion it posted in the same period last year after net interest income rose 28.94 per cent to Sh22.41 billion. Loans increased by 6.92 per cent to Sh227.05 billion, while customer deposits were almost flat, rising 1.6 per cent to Sh257.80 billion. "The sustained performance is attributable to the realisation of gains from the bold Transformation Project that the bank has been implementing since 2014 with a critical focus on improving operating efficiencies, sales force effectiveness and innovative customer delivery platforms," managing director Gideon Muriuki said at an investor briefing in Nairobi. The transformation programme, dubbed Soaring Eagle, guided by US management consultancy McKinsey, has seen more than 400 staff retrenched as the lender digitises and automates its operations to enhance efficiencies. Muriuki said the ongoing programme has improved its cost to income ratio to 47.1 per cent in September from 49.04 per cent in September 2015 and about 60 per cent in 2014. The publicly traded lender targets to improve this further to 45 per cent to protect margins in the wake of interest controls touched off by Banking (Amendment) Act 2016. The 146-branch lender, however, plans to open new outlets targeting new shopping malls and select counties. &ldquo;We have budgeted to have additional branches, particularly in the upcoming malls,&rdquo; Muriuki said. &ldquo;It will be very difficult to go to a county where you don't have a physical branch. People want to see a physical branch for them.&rdquo;The bank said it was targeting to increase the contribution of non-interest income streams to its total revenues to 40 per cent from 31 per cent with about 80 to 85 per cent of transactions now on alternative digital channels. Non-funded income increased 6.81 per cent to Sh9.88 billion in the review period. &ldquo;In terms of value, what we are seeing is that about 50 per cent of transactions are through digital platforms and that is set to increase,&rdquo; director for retail banking Maurice Matumo said.
