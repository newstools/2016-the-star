Early morning drives often have a feeling of the unexpected. Such an event happened near junction No4. We noticed a car ahead of us had stopped. Suddenly, the large shape of a spotted hyena emerged from a bush and walked towards the bridge. In recent years, hyena have been rarely seen due to their low numbers. However, it appears their numbers are slowly beginning to recover, with a number of small packs in certain areas.It is also useful to note that there are a number of &ldquo;dog-like&rdquo; species resident in the park. There are two hyaenidae species, notably the spotted hyena and the aardwolf. Past records indicate that striped hyena were previously also found in the park. Spotted hyena form family groups called packs and are also very effective hunters. Aardwolf look like miniature striped hyenas. However, they are not carnivores. Instead, they eat large quantities of insects and focus on termites.The jackal species are the most closely related to our domestic dogs. Two species of Canis are found in the park, namely the black-backed jackal and the rarer, side-striped jackal. There are three species that used to occur in the park: the already mentioned striped hyena, the African wild dog, last seen in the 1980s south of the park near Kajado, and the insect-eating, bat-eared fox, previously resident in the Athi basin and a few other termite-populated dry areas.Species like hyena, jackals, Africanwild dog, Aardwolf and foxes all have an important role in balancing an ecosystem, and, therefore, need to be protected.
