Five circumcisers were arrested and a 10-year-old girl rescued before the illegal cut in a swoop in Kuria West subcounty on Friday.Area OCPD Evans Wanyonyi said the girl from the Bukira clan was to officially open a Female Genital Mutilation exercise in the area. We were lucky to rescue her before she underwent the cut. She has been taken to Komotobo children's home, said Wanyonyi.The OCPD said four other suspects, including three circumcisers, were arrested in Kuria East subcounty last week while planning to launch the exercise there.Kuria East deputy county commissioner Wesley Koech said they trailed the women after elders told them they were picked to perform FGM this season.Koech said seven others from Kegonga and Ntimaru intended to carry out door-to-door operations to dodge arrests.But he said security personnel and residents established Nyumba Kumi centres for incidents to be reports, and that a special force will work on ending the vice. All the suspects will be arraigned at Kehancha law courts as we pursue other suspects who escaped to Tanzania, he said.Read: Anti-FGM board to work with counties, NGOs to jointly fight against viceAlso read; Why FGM has returned with a vengeance in Marakwet
