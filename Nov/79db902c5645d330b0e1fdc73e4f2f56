The Nairobi government will come up with innovative ways to create jobs and address youth unemployment, Governor Evans Kidero has said.He said there has been an influx of youth, especially those completing colleges, form four and standard eight and even dropouts, into the capital. Every year, about 1.2 million youth graduate from colleges and, interestingly, about 800,000 of them end up in Nairobi, looking for a job. But we only created about 50,000 jobs a year, Kidero said.The governor said there are about 100,000 school-age children out of school in Nairobi, although education is free.The city boss said there are 500,000 children in primary schools in the city and about 47,500 of them sit KCPE every year. Out of the 47,500, only 22,000 move to secondary schools. The governor spoke during a service at the Mavuno Church in Lavington yesterday.The city boss said his administration has been providing scholarships and partnering with private entities to develop schools.He cited Olympic Primary in Kibera, Old Mathari in Mathare, Marurui Primary School in Roysambu and Marura in Kariobangi. At Olympic, we partnered with Britam and constructed 36 classrooms, Kidero said.
