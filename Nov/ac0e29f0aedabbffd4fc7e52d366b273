In another sign of the faltering war on illicit liquor, 50 women raided the home of a chang aa seller yesterday and beat up four men.The drama unfolded in the morning in King eero village, Kabete constituency. They dragged the owner, 50-year-old Franko Okori to the police who arrested him.They recovered 10 litres of chag aa in bottles of various liquor brands. When the women entered, the men started insulting them and the women beat them up. The men fled into a maize plantation. On July 1 last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered a crackdown on illicit liquor, starting in Central. There was some success but for months, many reports indicate brew is back. Uhuru called it the business of death. Many middle-aged men have been adversely affected, as they normally flock to that home in the morning. They don t bring anything at home, yet they ask for food, Martha Wairimu said.Destiny of King eero Women s Group chairperson Jane Chege said women live in desperation as some men cannot satisfy them sexually and cannot sire children. Their systems have been destroyed by alcohol and they risk being impotent, she said.Chege criticised men for idling, instead of providing for their families. Okori said he gets the drink from Kisii for his personal consumption from a friend in Westlands. My friends beg me to sell it and I charge Sh50 per glass, he said. Okori and his liquor were hauled to King eero police station, where police boss Njeri Nthiga locked him up.Kiambu county Alcoholic Drinks and Control Board director Michael Kang ethe urged residents to report violators and said all bars and shops would be inspected. He said the state is keen to prevent a comeback of brew.
