Former Rarieda MP Raphael Tuju s appointment as Jubilee Party Secretariat boss will not affect Nyanza votes for Cord leader Raila Odinga, Alego Usonga MP Muluan Omondi has said. He said Nyanza voters will not be hoodwinked into supporting the former Foreign Affairs minister s initiatives geared towards dividing Raila s votes . I did not want to comment on Jubilee affairs, but I am sure that Tuju will not deliver any vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta from Nyanza, Omondi said yesterday. He added that Tuju is not a reformist, has never been known to fight for democracy and lacks the aptitude required to convince anti-Jubilee voters to vote for Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto. Tuju cannot even marshal enough votes in his constituency and that puts him in no capacity to scuttle ODM votes in Rarieda and Nyanza, Omondi said. He spoke in Tula Village, North Alego.
