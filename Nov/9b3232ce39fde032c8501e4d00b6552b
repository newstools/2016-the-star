For breakfast I have eggs with yoghurt and fruit while getting organised for the day. I also take time to write a task list, an order for the day and a plan of attack. I usually get some work done before I leave the house. Then I pack a bag with snacks, lunch and anything else I need for the day and head to the office.9AM-12PMI arrive at the office and start the day with a cup of tea or a coffee. I check my emails to see if there are any updates regarding projects and emails that need a quick response. I check the calendar to see if I have meetings or conference calls as well.From then my time is divided between developing content, researching, writing, editing and meetings until lunch time. Lunch is usually varied but consists of vegetables, a protein and a starch. Lunch is also the time I check in with my colleagues and catch up with them.12PM-6PMAfter lunch I usually continue with the tasks I have not completed. Day to day activities vary, depending on the project I am working on. At the end of the day I evaluate my progress against my to-do list and make a note of the things I need to complete the next day.6PM-9PMThe time I get home depends on how late my conference calls are, traffic and whether I have errands to run in town or meetings.I start preparing dinner. It is fairly straightforward with protein and vegetables. For example, grilled fish with steamed vegetables. I watch TV and catch up on my reading, then go to bed between 10pm and midnight.WEEKENDSMy weekends are spent doing errands, cleaning, laundry, baking and cooking and then going out with family and friends. I also love DIY projects, so I try to do something different every weekend.
