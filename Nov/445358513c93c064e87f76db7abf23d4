Every KCPE candidate in Garissa subcounty is sitting the exam in the centre where he or she registered, deputy county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo said yesterday. He was responding to education stakeholders and leaders who had urged the exam council not to move children from their schools.The Kenya National Examination Council had proposed moving the candidates closer to the containers where the test papers were stored. It also cited insecurity. On Sunday Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye and Dadaab s Mohamed Dahiye said making candidates write the exam far away from their parents will lower their performance.Last week Knut Garissa branch officials said moving pupils from their schools will inconvenience them and undermine their performance.The exam began yesterday. Speaking to the press at his office after touring some schools, Galgalo said the candidates in all the 59 centres will sit the exam in their respective schools. The government has put in enough measures. Security has also been enhanced, with more than 130 police officers posted in the centres and so we expect the exercise to go on smoothly to its conclusion, Galgalo said.Some 2,805 pupils are writing the exam. Out of this, 1,673 are boys and 1,132 girls. A total of 952,472 candidates are sitting the exam in countrywide.The exam materials are stored in 346 containers in subcounties under the management of subcounty commissioners and subcounty education officers.
