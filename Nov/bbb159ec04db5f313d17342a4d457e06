Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has alleged that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is out to "kill and silence him".Awiti said unknown people in two vehicles trailed his entourage to a parking lot in Mamba Village, Mombasa county on Sunday.He said the vehicles took off after realising he was not in the vehicle."I was lucky since I was not in the car. What would have happened if I was in there?" he said.He said he had left his security team behind to attend a church service in Nyali. The security team was to wait for him at Mamba Village.The MP said he cheated death but now fears for his life and that of those around him.He said similar incidents took place in 2013 and 2014 while he was in the company of his wife. He said no one has since been prosecuted in connection with attempts on his life despite filing reports.He claimed he is a target since he has been on the forefront in the fight against impunity instigated by "the Governor and his people".Read: ODM leader intervenes to end Joho and Awiti infighting"I am a man and would not sit down and watch people come to my backyard and intimidate me," Awiti said.The Governor and his communication team were unavailable for comment on Awiti's allegations.Awiti and Joho have in the past clashed over issues surrounding governance in the county.In August, the MP launched his bid for Joho's seat in the 2017 general elections.More on this: Kalonzo asks Awiti, Omar to join forces to beat Joho
