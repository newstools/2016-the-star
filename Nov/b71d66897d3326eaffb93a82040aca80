Governor Evans Kidero has threatened to put a land buying company in Embakasi under statutory management over reluctance to cooperate with the county.On Saturday, he said the directors of Njiru Githunguri Company have refused to honour meeting requests to resolve land disputes in Utawala and other parts of Eastlands. Kidero spoke at Utawala SDA Church. The directors have been uncooperative because they want to stick to the land so that every time there is a change of share certificate, they make money, he said.Kidero said the company has not followed procedures when allocating land, leading to grabbing of public spaces and personal property. The irregular allocations have caused disputes and deaths in Embakasi.
