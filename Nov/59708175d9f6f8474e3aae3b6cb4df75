Two close allies of ODM leader Raila Odinga seem likely to go head-to-head in the Suba parliamentary race next year. They are incumbent MP John Mbadi and Raila&rsquo;s former chief of staff Caroli Omondi.Little-known Jackie Nyandege is also in the race. Omondi said his loyalty to ODM is unwavering and he should be rewarded with the party ticket.&ldquo;I have never paid allegiance to another political party apart from ODM, hence, this time round, it&rsquo;s my chance to win the seat,&rdquo; he said. Omondi said he did not ditch the party even after Moses Kajwang&rsquo; was chosen to run in a by-election after Senator Otieno Kajwang&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;I remained steadfast, even though the nomination was not credible,&rdquo; he said. Mbadi said, however, his development record speaks volumes and will earn him a third term. &ldquo;The question of whether I will defeat Caroli is unnecessary. What I should be asked is with what margin will I triumph over him.&rdquo;
