Two close allies of ODM leader Raila Odinga seem likely to go head-to-head in the Suba parliamentary race next year. They are incumbent MP John Mbadi and Raila s former chief of staff Caroli Omondi.Little-known Jackie Nyandege is also in the race. Omondi said his loyalty to ODM is unwavering and he should be rewarded with the party ticket. I have never paid allegiance to another political party apart from ODM, hence, this time round, it s my chance to win the seat, he said. Omondi said he did not ditch the party even after Moses Kajwang was chosen to run in a by-election after Senator Otieno Kajwang s death. I remained steadfast, even though the nomination was not credible, he said. Mbadi said, however, his development record speaks volumes and will earn him a third term. The question of whether I will defeat Caroli is unnecessary. What I should be asked is with what margin will I triumph over him.
