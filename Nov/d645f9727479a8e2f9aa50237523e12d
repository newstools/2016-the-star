Abubakar Kadernani and Imara Belathorpe have been added to the Kenya swimming team to the World short course Championships in Canada next month.The duo replace Olympians Talissa Lanoe and Hamdan Bayusuf in the squad.Lanoe pulled out citing examinations commitment at her university in Florida while Bayusuf cited personal reasons for his withdrawal.The rest of the squad will include Emily Muteti, Rebecca Kamau and Sylvia Brunlehner in the girls category while Issa Abdalla and Kimani Maina will fly the country s flag in the boys category.Only last week, Micah Fernandez, who is based in Canada, pulled out also citing exams, which he said would coincide with the championship. Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) treasurer, David Ngugi said the team selected is strong enough and will be competitive despite the late withdrawals. It s a good team. We may have late withdrawals but the swimmers selected have the experience and I have no doubt they will do the country proud, added NgugiElsewhere, Kenya will not be sending a team to the CANA Zone 3 Championships slated to start on November 18 in Rwanda.The Joint Selection Committee, which was appointed by the court to oversee selection to swimming competitions, said the federation hard forwarded to them the invitation letter from the Rwandese Swimming Federation late despite the host nation sending it in August.They also accused the federation for not having updated swimming records amid numerous anomalies detected in the database of swimmers.This will be the second event Kenya is missing after skipping the Africa Championships in Bloemfontein, South Africa last month, owing to similar issues.The swimming stakeholders in conjunction with the Joint Selection Committee will meet today to deliberate on the possibility of sending a team to CANA Zone four championships in Zimbabwe in February next year. Plans are underway to employ full time competition secretary to work on the database of both NASA and KSF.
