Suba MP John Mbadi has said members of Parliaments Public Accounts Committee were being compromised by government to frustrate the probe into the NYS scandal.Mbadi is a member of the committee chaired by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo.The MP claimed agents from the office of the president had approached members to advise them against investigations into the Sh1.6 billion scam.He said Jubilee MPs who are members had been directed to ensure Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Deputy President William Ruto's aide Farouk Kibet do not appear before the committee for questioning. The committee may not get to the bottom of this matter. Those seeking (to frustrate the probe) are from the office of presidency but it may not be the President himself, he said.Mbadi, who spoke on NTV on Tuesday night, said that the amount of money lost in the scam was colossal, suggesting the country may have lost more than Sh10 billion.He said that the committee could not summon Suna East MP Junet Mohamed over reports in the media that he was involved in the theft at the National Youth Service.Two companies linked to Junet pocketed Sh129 million from the National Youth Service for dubious supply of goods.According to the Registrar of Companies, Junet holds 50 shares in Zeigham Enterprises with his P O Box number shown as 135, Suna, Migori.Zeigham, which was registered in July 2012, was paid Sh10,230,000 for the supply of 18 machine belts, a total of Sh6,660,000 for the supply of 12 submersible pumps and Sh5,500,000 for the supply of 10 centrifugal clutches, cut section MT-27.More on this: Junet Mohamed received Sh129 million from NYS - Jubilee MPsAlso read: Farouk Kibet establishes link between NYS suspects Kabura and GethiMbadi said the PAC wants Murkomen and Farouk to appear before it because they were implicated by others who have been questioned.Mbadi dismissed assertions by Murkomen that he could not be summoned because he is a lawyer.He said the committee summoned and grilled a lawyer representing businessman Ben Gethi.
