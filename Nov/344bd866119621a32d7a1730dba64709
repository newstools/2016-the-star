More than 17 aspirants have shown interest in the Nakuru West constituency seat in case the seat is declared vacant.The current holder, ODM&rsquo;s Samuel Arama, was among MPs expelled by the party. If the seat is declared vacant, the 17 hopefuls say they will try to unseat Arama. He will run on the Jubilee ticket.Aspirants include Nakuru&rsquo;s former mayor John Kitilit, Victor Ngatia, Mwangi Kariko, Charles Maisiba, William Towet, Mohamed Suraw, Francisca Kamuren and Arama, who have hit the ground running.ODM aspirants include Eric Ogada, Sospeter Nyakundi, Hezron Okiki, Isoe Ochoki, Peter Ndubi, Likwilo Ndeta, Jimmy Ojwang and James Michoma. Political analysts say merger of 12 Jubilee affiliates means ODM must work hard to retain the seat.Some analysts say Jubilee lost the Nakuru Town West seat to ODM in 2013 because it allowed TNA and URP to field separate candidates, despite being in one coalition.The area will be a battleground forsupremacy between ODM, led by Raila Odinga, against UhuRuto. Of the 11 constituencies in the county, only Nakuru Town West was represented by an opposition legislator. Jubilee is keen to ensure a fair nomination to avoid a fallout that might cost it the seat.Nakuru Town East politics, however, may influence that of the West.Arama has for the last two years been announcing that he is leaving ODM.&ldquo;I am more than ready for a by-election because I know I am still popular on the ground. ODM frustrated me in 2013 when I won the party primaries but the ticket was given to someone else. I had to go to court to get the ODM ticket,&rdquo; he said. Prior to the 2013 polls, Arama was in TNA but jumped ship to join ODM. He won the seat with 19,959 votes against Charles Masiba of TNA, who garnered 17,837.
