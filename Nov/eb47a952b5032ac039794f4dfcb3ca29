Tax agency officials demand bribes at the Mombasa port to inspect imported goods, the Association of Importers of Kenya has said. “Agents have raised complaints that if they do not part with some money, the value of goods on the declaration documents are hiked and taxes increased,” secretary general Jacob Misiko said. He accused KRA Customs and Border Control Commissioner Julius Musyoki of protecting the corruption officials at the Port of Mombasa. AIK has written to KRA and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the Customs officials. In a letter dated November 9, Misiko said corrupt KRA officers at the port are pocketing millions of shilling by changing the value of goods declared on the invoices. “A offence file is opened accusing the agent of trying to mis-declare the cargo and the clients are compelled to pay for penalties for undervaluation and mis-declaration,” he said. Musyoki, however, has denied the allegations and promised to give a detailed press statement regarding KRA operations at the port. He said Misiko has no authority to talk on behalf of importers.
