A British tycoon who died in Mombasa was poisoned by a pesticide, a court was told.Former government pathologist Dr Moses Njue said a postmortem report showed Harry Veevers was poisoned by Cyhalothrin.He said the analysis of wet soil samples and body tissues from the position of the stomach were found to contain the chemical. The presence of the chemical in the stomach means it had been ingested while the deceased was alive. Obviously, he was poisoned, he told chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti.Veevers died at his Nyali bungalow on February 14, 2013. He lived with his second wife Emma Parvenu and daughters Alexandra Azra and Helen Veevers.Veevers was buried at a Muslim cemetery in Mombasa three days after his death. His body was, however, exhumed a year later when his sons Richard and Philip demanded to know the circumstances surrounding his death.Richard said his father had received death threats from his stepmother before he died. My father visited me in my home and told me my stepmother had threatened to kill him after he revealed to her that he had a Kenyan girlfriend, he said.Richard said he did not see the need to report the matter to the police as he did not think it was serious.He said before his father s revelation that he wanted to marry a Kenyan woman, they had all lived happily in the UK.Richard also questioned why his father was hurriedly buried as a Muslim when he was Christian.The two said there was a conspiracy between their stepsisters and stepmother to kill Veevers, leading to an inquest.The court was told the soil samples were taken from the grave after the body was exhumed.During the analysis of the specimens, which also included teeth, Njue said the chemical was not noticed on the dry soil. He dismissed the possibility of the chemical being a result of the preservatives used at Pandya mortuary. We would have found body tissues intact if it had been injected with formalin. It is also false to say that he might have consumed a vegetable sprayed with the chemical since washing and exposure to light removes the chemical altogether, he said.The inquest led by assistant DPP Alexander Muteti will continue today.
