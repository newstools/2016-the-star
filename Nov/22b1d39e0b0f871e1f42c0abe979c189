We got a tip off from members of the public and arrived at the parcel which is next to a forest and started uprooting the crop before dawn, Matata said.Matata said police did not make arrests as the suspects and plot owner escaped before police arrived.Kirui said fight against drugs and other illegal substances will continue in all the subcounties within Migori. The county's proximity to Tanzania has made the fight to be hard because of the porous border, Kirui said.He said the trade is behind a spate of insecurity in Isebania border and the Kuria region of Migori county.He also warned against those involved in the trade that the police officers will not relent in their efforts to eradicate the vice and the trade.Also read: Migori cops seize Sh4m bhang from Tanzania
