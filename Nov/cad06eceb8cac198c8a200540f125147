We know Jubilee is desperate; they are employing all tricks in the book to frustrate Oparanya politically and create space for their candidate, he said.He added it was hostile in Kakamega but that Oparanya will win and succeed Raila Odinga as ODM leader in 2022.Sakwa said the council wanted Senator Bonny Khalwale to postpone his bid for governor to the 2022 general election. To be governor you need to be an administrator, not a politician. This is the difference between Oparanya and his opponents; most of them are politicians, said the chairman.Oparanya will face Khalwale, former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe, businesswoman Marble Muruli and Retired Major Suleiman Sumba in the poll set for August 8.Read: Khalwale to run for Kakamega governorAlso read: Do not force us to vote for ODM candidates, Khalwale tells Raila
