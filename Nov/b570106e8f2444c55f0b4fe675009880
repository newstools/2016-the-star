A section of Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega which was under construction has collapsed.The stadium was undergoing a 1 billion shillings renovation, which was launched by Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya in June last year. The renovation was to be done in five phases with the first phase expected to be done by December.The entire project was to be completed by August 2017.The collapse might interfere with the completion of the first phase of the renovations which cost sh 399 million.Critics had earlier in the year questioned the quality of work done by the contractors, with Makhialo ward MCA Cleophas Malala raising suspicions that the county government was rushing to complete its projects before next year's general election to use them for campaigning.The project had stalled last year less than a month after it's launch over alleged financial constraints.
