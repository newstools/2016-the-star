Cotu has said the continued importation of illegal sugar into the country is to blame for the huge losses recorded by the Mumias Sugar Company. Deputy secretary general Benson Okwaro said unless the government stops the illegal sugar imports from flooding the local market, the collapse of the the sugar industry is imminent. "Already the country s retail shops, including supermarkets are fully stocked with imported sugar and one can hardly find any local sugar," he said in a statement.Okwaro said the move is designed by well-connected sugar barons operating within the government to ensure no local sugar finds itself in retail shop shelves.He said this is killing the local industries and rendering thousands of Kenyans jobless.Okwaro said the extensive labour in the agriculture sector remains the only guarantee for the government to create employment for the youth.
