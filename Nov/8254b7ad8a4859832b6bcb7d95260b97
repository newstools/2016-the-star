Alumira said FKF s initial fixtures indicated that all the matches would be played on Saturday and was surprised that Oserian and Falcons match was rescheduled for Sunday. Somebody somewhere didn t want us to be the representatives of Zone B in the play offs. When the fixtures were released, all the matches were to be played at the same day (Saturday at 1 pm). After being awarded a walk over after Nyamira County failed to show up, we were awaiting the results from Oserian and Falcons only to be told the tie has been moved to Sunday, observed Alumira. He added: Is it not surprising that Oserian needed to score seven goal and they got eight?
