Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has returned to his farm where he will spend the next week promoting agriculture and overseeing government projects across the district of Lowero. The presidential motorcade has, at least temporarily, been replaced by a bicycle, which he will be using to fetch water for his crops.According to a spokesperson on the trip, the president has already been showing locals how to plant bananas and coffee, using plastic bottles to irrigate the land.The president has been tweeting photos of himself (in pink shirt and hat) lending a helping hand to local farmers."With changing weather patterns and unreliable rainfall, farmers must do more irrigation. Like I demonstrated, it should not be expensive," he said in another post.
