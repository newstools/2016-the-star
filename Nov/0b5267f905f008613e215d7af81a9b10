Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok has told off DP William Ruto for questioning the use of county funds in the county.Nanok said Ruto's utterances were misleading, unfortunate and unbecoming."When a Deputy President lies before the people that he doesn't know where the funds sent to Turkana go, demonstrates how wreckless and uninterested one is on the well-being of a people," the Governor said on Thursday.He said Ruto was only bitter after the Jubilee government lost in the Kalolol ward by-election.[VIDEO] Governor Nanok warns Jubilee against plans to rig Kalokol ward mini-pollNanok made the remarks following a visit by the DP and President Uhuru Kenyatta to launch the Kitale-Lokichar road on Wednesday.Ruto questioned the use of funds in Turkana and compared the Kainuk road to the 'road to heaven', for being rough and difficult.He said the Jubilee administration will ensure its construction from early 2017.But the Governor accused the DP of sneaking into Turkana without notifying county officials."The Governor was not told. If this is how counties and the national government are supposed to work then it is not in the spirit of the constitution of mutual consultation and respect," he said."We thought the launch of the road was devoid of politics, but the DP demonstrated lack of knowledge about Turkana ... he should know that Turkanas identify with those who are truthful and committed to their cause, not with those whose intent it to loot Turkana resources."Read: ODM wins ward by-elections in Kisii, Kajiado and Turkana as Jubilee takes Tana RiverHe asked the DP to see the gains of devolution being celebrated by Turkana and avoid politicising development."Turkana County and its people respect the Presidency, we wish that the same respect is extended. Our people pay taxes no matter how small it is. We cannot compare Turkana with other parts of this country." "The momentum is slowly gaining because we all know as a result of several years of political marginalisation what Turkana looked like."
