Bungoma politician and businessman Wycliffe Wangamati has defended his company, Bonito Properties, which was named among those that got NYS contracts.Wangamati, who is one of the directors, said Bonito was contracted to construct six barracks using the modern EPS mode of construction. The company is involved in real estate businesses and was contracted for a housing project, he said."It is one of the few construction companies that has the capacity to use modern method of construction."He noted in a statement to the media on Wednesday that the organisation's business dealings were genuine but that they were yet to be fully paid by the National Youth Service.Documents from the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee, that the Star has seen, show Bonito was paid Sh217,778,629 through Kenya Commercial Bank's Milimani branch. This was for the refurbishment of NYS barracks in Gilgil, contradictory to the statement by Wangamati.The businessman further denied claims that the payments he has received so far were irregular.He said the tender his company won was worth Sh40 million and that they had finished the work.Wagamati further said the tender included training NYS recruits on new construction methods.Bonito Properties was mentioned last Friday as one of the faceless companies that received payments from the youths agency.It was reported that contracts worth Sh1.64 billion were given to 40 companies whose directors were unknown.Documents from the registrar of companies identified Bonito's other directors as Caroline Wesonga, Brian Okumu and Kennedy Musebe.Read: List of Josephine Kabura's companies that received Sh1.6 billionThe PAC will be forced to call more witnesses before retreating to write its report on the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal.The key House watchdog committee was to conclude its hearings on the mega fraud early in November, but fresh details by former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru compelled it to give those mentioned an opportunity to be heard.Parliament also expanded investigations after fresh details indicated 17 more banks handled money for suppliers since 2013.More on this: PAC call for more witnesses to delay Sh1.6 billion NYS theft reportAlso read: 17 banks among more than 100 firms linked Sh1.6 billion NYS cash theft
