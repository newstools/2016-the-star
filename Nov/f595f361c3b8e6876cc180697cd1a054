Kisii Senator Chris Obure has said ODM's win in Nyacheki by-elections should not be used as a measure of what will happen in 2017.Obure said Naftal Onkoba's victory had been used to attract "propaganda and funny interpretations" to hoodwink residents.He said the area was a sample insufficient for conclusions on next year's election.&ldquo;The win should not be used as a litmus test. The mini-poll has been used to dupe residents that the same will be replicated in the coming polls,&rdquo; he said.Obure further said the people who participated in the exercise based their votes on clan politics.&ldquo;Clan and subclan politics influenced the outcome of Nyacheki by-election which had 15 candidates," he told the press in Kisii at the weekend.The Senator also said the violence and intimidation which characterised the exercise might have led to voter apathy given that 6,738 out of the 10,924 registered voters participated in the polls.&ldquo;Let us not brag using the Nyacheki outcome. People should do so if the party wins in four wards in the entire Bobasi constituency,&rdquo; he said.The by-election followed the death of former MCA Peter Nyaega. Onkoba garnered 2,216 to clinch the seat, Magoma emerged second with 1,173 votes, while Caleb Ong&rsquo;uti of the Kenya National Congress bagged 979 votes.Read: ODM wins ward by-elections in Kisii, Kajiado and Turkana as Jubilee takes Tana RiverAlso read: Jubilee rejects ODM win in Nyacheki ward by-election, mulls court redressObure further noted that leaders in the area were elected on different party tickets in 2013, leaving no indication that any one party was in control.The Senator also noted that he backed &rsquo;s Liberal Party in 2004 and popularised among the Gusii before it transformed into ODM.He said he supported Cord leader Raila Odinga's presidential bids in 2007 and 2013 but will not do so again as he lost retired President Mwai Kibaki and President Uhuru Kenyatta respectively.Obure said their unity was intact and asked ODM leaders, "chest-thumping" about Kisii being their stronghold, to remember that residents make independent decisions.But he congratulated Onkoba on defeating Jubilee Party contestant Maxwell Magoma and urged residents to support him to ensure development.He defended the move by Gusii leaders to unite and work with the national government, saying the cooperation is enshrined in the supreme law and should not be misinterpreted to mean defection to JP.Read: Kisii Senator Obure ditches ODM for JubileeAlso read: Kisii unity caucus shaken after Nyacheki loss, return of two MPs to ODM
