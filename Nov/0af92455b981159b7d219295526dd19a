Stakeholders from the tourism industry in Northeastern want a proposed protection service to address some of the fundamental problems.They gave their views during a one-day workshop in Garissa town on Saturday, organised by the Tourism ministry.Lantern Hotel manager Erskine Chombo said despite having a tremendous tourism potential, much has not been done to market the region, both locally and internationally.He said security and terror attacks have hurt the sector. An incident happens in Mandera, but however minor it may look, it will end up having adverse effects on the entire region, Chombo said.He added that in the past year, there have been improvements in security. Sheikh Mohamed Abdikeir from Wajir said it is the third time in less than three months that the Tourism ministry has organised a workshop in Garissa to promote tourism.Abdikeir said it is necessary to educate rural residents on protecting and caring for wildlife, especially those living in areas prone to human-wildlife conflicts. Northeastern has unique wildlife and other historical sites that if well managed will spur tourism in the region and the country, he said.A taskforce was formed on November 9 to collect views from tourism stakeholders countrywide on the best ways to protect wildlife and promote tourism. The service will be under the Tourism ministry. The team will draft a report to guide policy formulation.
