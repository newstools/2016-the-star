Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi was yesterday questioned by EACC detectives for more than seven hours over the alleged misappropriation of millions of shillings.Kingi was questioned over the Sh51 million payments through Ifmis, the purchase of 11 acres for the Mtwapa bus park at Sh308 million and the mysterious payment of Sh34 million to two companies for unknown services.Mediscope Agencies Ltd was paid Sh24 million by the Kilifi government for unknown services, while Grand Top Solutions received Sh10 million for unspecified services.Kingi arrived at the Integrity Centre at 11.30am. He was escorted by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, his lawyer and Siaya Senator James Orengo, woman representative Aisha Jumwa, Taveta MP Joyce Lay, Embakasi South MP Irshard Sumra and student leader Babu Owino. Kingi had failed to turn up last Friday.Raila Odinga s daughter Rosemary arrived at the Integrity Centre later.A contingent of Anti-Riot police, APs and Kenya Police cordoned off the Integrity Centre to keep out about 100 supporters who walked from the Serena Hotel to the anti-graft agency s head office. The EACC recorded Kingi s statements in connection with the Kilifi government s use of funds.Kilifi has been on the spot for what has been blamed on manipulation of the Ifmis. Kingi has insisted he was the whistle blower.It has emerged the Kilifi government advertised for and bought the 11 acres of Mtwapa bus park and market land under investigation.The county in October 2014 requested anyone with a minimum of 10 acres on the Mombasa-Malindi highway not more than four kilometres from the Mtwapa Bridge.
