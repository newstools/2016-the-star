Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has said the county government will today go to court to compel five companies to return Sh43 million they allegedly received irregularly.The five companies are Makegra Supplies Ltd, Zohali Services Ltd, Kilifi Investment Services Ltd, Leadership Edge Associates Ltd and Daima One Enterprises. Kingi said they received Sh51 million payments through the Integrated Financial Management Information System by fraudulent means, but Sh8 million was reversed by the Central Bank of Kenya. Speaking in Mtsengo village on Wednesday, when he accompanied Cord leader Raila Odinga to distribute relief food, Kingi said the county has received information on all the companies and shared it with investigating agencies, but no action has been taken.The meeting was attended by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and MPs Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe), William Kamoti (Rabai) and Gunga Mwinga of Kaloleni. We did everything within our mandate when we realised the money was stolen. We suspended all the officers whose passwords were used after we withdrew their log-in rights to the payment system, Kingi said. He said the companies have been stealing from other counties through Ifmis.
