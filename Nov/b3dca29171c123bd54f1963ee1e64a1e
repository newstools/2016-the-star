Kerry called on the governor to build state-of-the-art hospitals and avoid 'embarrassment' by travelling abroad.David Mwangi on the other hand said it was wrong for Kenyans, mostly from Bomet, to give the governor a grand reception at the airport.He said such actions are demeaning to the health sector in the country."...So Rutto got injured in a confrontation and flew to SA for treatment and he receives a grand reception at the airport, Kenyans need to wake up," Mwangi said.Kigo Njoroge called on Bomet residents to vote for another governor in 2017 as Rutto's trip to South Africa showed he had nothing meaningful for the county."If Hospitals in Bomet can't remove an elastoplast, what has Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto been doing in 4 years?
