THE 2016 national basketball play-off finals will be played early next year, according to the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) competitions secretary Joseph Amoko.The official said it is not possible to have the play-off semis and finals played this year due to the coming Fiba Africa Club Championships for men and women.Kenya will be represented by United States International University and Kenya Ports Authority in the women s category and Ulinzi Warriors (men) in the Africa Club championships, a development, he said had complicated matters. As you can see, three of our top teams will be participating in the prestigious final tours of the Africa Championships. This move has made it impossible for us to have the two phases of the competition completed this year, said Amoko. The continental women s event, where KPA and USIU will fly the country s flag will take place in Maputo, Mozambique from November 24 to December 4 while Ulinzi will feature in the men s version slated for December 7-15 in Cairo, Egypt. The three giants booked their tickets to the continental festival during last month s Fiba Africa Zone Five tournament in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania. KPA won the championship with USIU and Ulinzi finishing second. The soldiers were later awarded a wild card.Amoko said the lower division matches will run as scheduled but the Premier League post-season games will end at the quarter finals level before resuming in January from the semis and then the finals.
