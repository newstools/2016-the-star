Dairy farmers in Nyandarua county will no longer incur losses by selling milk to middlemen at throwaway prices if a planned processing plant is built.Farmers have for years incurred losses by selling to brokers cheaply to make money before the milk goes bad. Some have made huge losses when their milk goes bad due to lack of a storage and cooling facility.Senator Muriuki Karue said plans are underway to build a Sh1.2 billion plant on 30 acres in Kipipiri. The land has been identified and what remains are ways and means to acquire the land valued at Sh30 million. This will include fencing and water supply for the facility, he said.Once complete, the processor, named Nyandarua Maziwa Dairies, will collect milk from residents, process it and sell to markets across the country. The county earns more than Sh200 million annually from the dairy sector.REWARDSKarue told the Nyandarua county assembly the sector still needs to improve so stakeholders can benefit.The County Industrial Development Bill, 2014, passed by the Senate, will address some sector challenges and guide in supporting small industries countrywide.
