Some Coast legislators are lobbying to have key players in the maritime industry given slots in boards of management at the Kenya Maritime Authority, Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Bureau of Standards.MPs Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Badi Twalib (Jomvu) and Omar Mwinyi (Jomvu) on Monday said these boards are politically constituted, which influences decision-making in the sector. Nassir said medical agencies are represented by people who have medical backgrounds, but in the shipping industry people are given jobs because of their political inclination. It will only be fair if we have people from the shipping industry given slots, he said. What we see currently are people who have retired and old enough to be our grandparents given opportunities to lead these boards. This is just political payback. Nassir spoke on Monday during a press conference in Mombasa.Twalib said Kifwa should have a say in all port matters because it is the biggest stakeholder, contributing about 80 per cent of all the customs revenue.
