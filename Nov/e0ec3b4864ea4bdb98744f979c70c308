Some politicians have urged Cord leader Raila Odinga to stop criticising the government on withdrawing troops from South Sudan.ODM expelled Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama and his Borabu counterpart Ben Momanyi said it is wrong for Raila to continue criticising Jubilee all the time. You cannot oppose everything every time. There s nothing the government does that Raila supports. Why should he be consulted? Arama said. He said Raila has for the longest time been calling for the withdrawal of troops from Somalia, but when the government withdraws them from Sout Sudan, he heavily criticises it. Raila will oppose something he stands for if Jubilee supports it, Arama said.
