ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday said a proposal by the National Assembly to postpone elections next year is a violation of the people s will.The date is August 8, 2017, but there have been calls to push it back because new poll requirements are complicated and a new IEBC has not been sworn in.A delay would keep the Jubilee administration in office longer. Changing the date would require a consitutional amendment and some lawmakers want to introduce one.The Constitution provides general elections be held on the first Tuesday of August of every fifth year. When Kenyans overwhelmingly voted for a permanent date, they did away with the date being used as a secret weapon by the incumbent. The election date as enshrined in the Constitution is meant to set a tradition and to provide certainty and predictability of elections, Mudavadi said in a statement.He said moving the date will create a constitutional crisis as it will prolong the term of the Jubilee administration. It is suspicious how clumsily Parliament amended the Elections Act and put in place unworkable deadlines. Was it deliberate since these amendments are now being used to justify postponing elections? Mudavadi asked. He said the ANC opposes clandestine attempts to abort the election date.Mudavadi said it is unfortunate Jubilee and Cord have not been forceful against plans to change the election date on flimsy and ridiculous excuses , such as school calendar and budget.
