Business owners in Nairobi will no longer apply for numerous permits after the county launched Unified Business Permit. This gives a boost to investors in the capital who contribute about 60 per cent to national wealth. The unified permit ensures the traders apply for one licence that covers all operational requirements. Previously, the traders were required to make separate applications for several permits including fire, advertising signage, fire clearance, health and food hygiene certificates. During the launch, Governor Evans Kidero said the new permit will ease the ways of doing business in the capital to save time. &ldquo;This permit will reduce cash handling by our staff and bring to an end harassment of business people by unscrupulous county inspectors,&rdquo; Kidero said.He said residents will apply for the unified permit through an online payment portal run by JamboPay. &ldquo;It will take less than five minutes to apply for the permit,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;There are many permits that the business people should have, but some of them do not know about them (permits). It is not their fault, that is why we decided to have a single permit,&rdquo; said the city boss. In the recent Ease of Doing Business report by World Bank Group&rsquo;s International Finance Corporation covering 11 counties, Nairobi was ranked the best in registration of property. Last week, Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said the method will ensure business people are not arrested for late or non-payments. &ldquo;It is something positive that residents should embrace because it goes a long way in improving their lives,&rdquo; Mueke said.The deputy governor, who was the brain behind the implementation of the county&rsquo;s e-payment system, dismissed reports that the county has lost revenue while using the electronic payment platform. The county has fully automated payment of parking fee. City Hall&rsquo;s revenue department said the system will increase returns by reducing instances where businesses default payments for different permits.
