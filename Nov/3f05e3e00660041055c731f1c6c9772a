Raila Odinga s ODM has said outgoing electoral commission members are determined to punish Cord leaders by ensuring they lose against Jubilee s Uhuru Kenyatta in the elections.Chairman John Mbadi said the determination by Isaack Hassan in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to procure the election materials before they leave office is a clear manifestation that a sinister motive is in the offing. We have information that they are talking with some top Jubilee figures to punish Cord. How they will do it is everyone s guess, Mbadi said.But commission CEO Ezra Chiloba said the earliest the new commission will be in office is January 2017 and by then, time will be limited. What we are doing is within the law and Kenyans should understand we don t have enough time to prepare, he said.
