Two Jubilee hopefuls for the Bomet governor&rsquo;s office have promised to support whoever wins the party&rsquo;s nomination.On Sunday, National Assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso and National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones said they will avoid any falling out between them and ensure the Jubilee Party bags the seat.Kones said, &ldquo;We are both seeking to vie for this seat on the Jubilee Party ticket and we will ensure we don&rsquo;t end up a divided house after the nominations. I promise to offer you [Laboso] my full support if I lose and I know you will also do the same.&rdquo; Laboso voiced similar sentiments, saying she was ready to back Kones. She said those who&rsquo;ll lose shouldn&rsquo;t leave the party.The duo also agreed to run peaceful, respectful campaigns. They said the violence at political rallies in the region should not be allowed to happen again.Kones and Laboso vowed to ensure the region remains a Jubilee zone, urging residents not to be swayed into voting for a candidate from another political outfit.Speaking at a church function at Kamung&rsquo;ei in Sotik, they said residents cannot afford to be left out of the ruling administration. Thus, they will ensure the next governor comes from Jubilee, they said.Kones and Laboso will face incumbent Governor Isaac Rutto who is defending his seat on the Chama Cha Mashinani ticket. Kones said Jubilee is a party of unity and for them to win, all hopefuls should not jump ship.
