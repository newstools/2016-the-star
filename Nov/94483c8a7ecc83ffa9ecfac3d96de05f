Nominated Senator Emma Mbura has denied having an extramarital affair with a Mombasa activist accused of defaming her.Mbura told a Mombasa court on Wednesday that she had "never even dreamt" of having a relationship with Kalinga Mgandi.The activist's allegations landed him in court in March when he was charged with the improper use of a licensed telecommunications gadget.He denied that on March 13, through the Mombasa community forum WhatsApp group, he sent abusive audio clips stating Mbura is fond of snatching other women's husbands.[AUDIO] Activist Kalinga stirs court with confession of love affair with Senator MburaThe Senator said the scandal has affected her family, especially her children, whom she said have become objects of ridicule.Mbura also said her dignity as a woman has diminished and that she can no longer stand in front of people who once viewed her as a role model."I was, and still am, psychologically and emotionally affected by Mgandi's claims which went viral," she said.Mbura added that the claims were politically instigated and that her ambitions to vie for a parliamentary seat in Rabai have been damaged.She said he made the claims after the March 8 Malindi by-election when she accused him of being a Cord sycophant within the Jubilee Party.The Senator said she questioned Mgandi's support for Cord and Governor Hassan Joho as he had he claimed he was a strong Jubilee supporter."I told him he was a snake because he claims to support us yet he was supporting someone else. This did not go down well with him, that's why he started hurling insults in WhatsApp groups we shared," she said.The case was adjourned until December 11.
