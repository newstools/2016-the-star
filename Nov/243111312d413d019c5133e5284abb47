The national government has said it will distribute relief food to the six subcounties of Mandera county facing famine.Sixty-three thousand households face starvation. One thousand bags of rice, 300 bags of beans and 200 bags of maize will be distributed.Governor Ali Roba yesterday said the county will supplement the contribution. He addressed residents in Kotulu subcounty. Present were MPs Adan Mohamed (Mandera North), Mohamed Mohamud (Mandera West MP), Abdi Haji (Banissa) and Mohamed Huka (Mandera South).They urged the government to distribute the food urgently because famine has become a national disaster.The MPs also urged the government to increase the allocation to the Drought Management Fund. They said the Sh5 billion set aside is too little to address famine across the country.The leaders urged the government to build backup generators to pump water from boreholes. The county has sunk boreholes in grazing regions including Elkuro, Makutano, Ogorwein and Kubi.The MPs raised concerns about the rise in disease among animals, leading to many deaths. Roba said a vaccination and deworming drive will be launched soon.
