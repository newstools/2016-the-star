Deputy President William Ruto has defended Jubilee against claims that the government wants to change the election date. We do not anticipate a change in the election calendar. Fears that the polls will be delayed are unfounded. Let s have faith in the electoral process and conduct peaceful campaigns, he said.The DP spoke when he visited South Imenti Constituency, Meru county, on Sunday. Sections of the opposition have said Jubilee is influencing the delay of the appointment of the electoral commissioners to push the election date.The IEBC selection committee, on Friday, re-advertised for the position of chairperson, citing numerous concerns raised against some of the candidates.This could push the formation of the new commission up to mid-January next year. Ruto also said Jubilee is building bridges across all communities and instilling a sense of unity for all Kenyans.
