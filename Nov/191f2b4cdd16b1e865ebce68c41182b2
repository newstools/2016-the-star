That President Uhuru Kenyatta launched a scathing attack on Cord leader Raila Odinga (pictured) is not news. What is news is why and how the President broke protocol to tear into the ODM leader during Jubilee&rsquo;s inaugural Governing Council meeting at Bomas on Friday. We are told the President&rsquo;s handlers asked him to first speak to the country before Raila could address what he calls a scandal regarding another hydro-project. The opposition leader believes this one could harm Kenyans in the Mau basin. That explains why Deputy President Wlliam Ruto spoke after the President, which violates protocol. The second thing is the message and manner in which Uhuru was asked to deliver his speech. He needed to dismiss corruption allegations and cast the opposition as a group of people who do not want development. His handlers were happy the President delivered as advised. *************As Uhuru was speaking, Raila was preparing to up the tempo on corruption in government. We are told the opposition has urged all its leaders to speak against the graft wherever and whenever they have a chance.They aim to make corruption an election issue. i*************The Public Accounts Committee is discussing the possibility of inviting Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s aide Farouk Kibet to testify in its probe of the NYS heist. Kibet has been mentioned by several witnesses, including former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru. Some committee members tell Corridors Kibet is a person of interest and may shed light on how NYS cash was looted and by whom.************Did some former Family Bank officials receive NYS cash from Ben Gethi and Josephine Kabura? We are told a former official pocketed Sh6 million by Gethi. The official then directed junior staff to open accounts and serve the two with their associates without questioning their transactions. We are told matter will be a subject of fresh investigation, especially because some bank employees have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko. ************A certain lady adviser in the Devolution ministry has shocked many people in government and is being described as the most powerful woman in the ministry. Despite not having been appointed by the President, the lady is said to be feared by many as she has become the gatekeeper, giving or withholding access to the CS and his PSs. She has become a subject of controversy and gossip within the corridors of power. Some accuse her of blocking access to the top officials.
