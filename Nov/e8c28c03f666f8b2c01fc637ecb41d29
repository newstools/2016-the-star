Some say we ll not survive in the next two months, Ragwa said.He warned the politicians behind the messages they will not succeed. Ragwa did not disclose the messages.

Some have said even if our names will be on the ballot or even if we re reelected,we ll end up in Kamiti. Ragwa said he would not succumb to pressure or fear. People are out there to see we are eliminated from this world or imprisoned for their own reasons.
