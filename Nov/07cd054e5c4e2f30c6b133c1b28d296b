President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday bid farewell to Qatari Ambassador Ibrahim Mohammed, whose tenure in the country has ended. He was in the country for four years. Qatar is one of the countries that Kenya has been enhancing bilateral relations with over the last decade. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were first established in 2003, although it was not until 2010 that Kenya opened an embassy in Doha. In April 2014, the President made a state visit to Qatar, where he met with the Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. They held talks on regional stabilisation, security and youth radicalisation.
