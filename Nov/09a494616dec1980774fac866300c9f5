Is this the week of humiliations? First, I find myself all over the Internet with the now infamous sex tape. Somehow, the heavens smiled at me and Eric did not see it. But now, because of Frank&rsquo;s meddling, Eric has caught me red-handed in the ladies&rsquo; room with Frank. He has just walked out. Frank is gone, too, after making some sarcastic comment about whether I still want him. I splash my face with water and try to calm down. Think! Think! Think! Crap, there&rsquo;s no way I can get out of this one. My skirt was around my waist. Frank had his hands all over me. Eric saw it all. Freaking fantastic. What a disaster! Okay. So I won&rsquo;t try and get out of it. Attack is always the best defence. Buoyed with new resolve, I retouch my lipstick, straighten my hair and walk out of the ladies&rsquo;. Frank is sitting on his bar stool, wearing a smirk as I walk past him. Bastard. I don&rsquo;t say anything to him. I turn the corner and I&rsquo;m surprised to see that Eric is still there with a glass of champagne in his hand. I approach cautiously, not quite sure where this is heading. I hesitate when I reach the table. &ldquo;Can I sit?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he responds, taking a sip from his drink. &ldquo;Well, that was embarrassing!&rdquo; I say. &rdquo;Was it? I found it quite amusing,&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not upset?&rdquo; I ask, surprised by his reaction. &ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; he says carefully, placing his glass on the table. &ldquo;Look, Eric,&rdquo; I say, kicking off my offensive. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we are in a relationship yet&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;True. But this is a date, is it not?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;One expects some decorum, no?&rdquo;&ldquo;No! I bumped into you in the mall and you offered to buy lunch!&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;So this is just two friends hanging out?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Eric,&rdquo; I say, softening my voice. &ldquo;I like you. You know I do. But you&rsquo;re getting out of a relationship. So am I.&rdquo; &ldquo;You two dated?&rdquo; he asks.&ldquo;We were engaged,&rdquo; I say. I remember when I found out through sneaky means about how Eric&rsquo;s girlfriend terminated a pregnancy. He was devastated. That will be my angle now. &ldquo;The truth is that I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; I say. My words are sincere. Well, clearly that&rsquo;s the only truthful thing that ever comes out of my mouth these days. &ldquo;Frank wanted me to terminate but I don&rsquo;t believe in abortions,&rdquo; I say. Eric looks stricken. I knew this would affect him because of his own personal situation with his girlfriend. Eric came to my home one morning loaded on cheap wine and whiskey. I made him breakfast and he proceeded to pass out. Some girl called &ndash; his girlfriend &ndash; and I answered the phone. We talked briefly. She sounded quite hurt that I was in the picture. I wanted to make sure she never called again. As he snored softly beside me, I quickly sent her a text message using his phone. Me: I heard you called. That&rsquo;s my new girl you spoke to. I don&rsquo;t need to answer questions about us, so I&rsquo;d appreciate if you respected my wishes and new relationship. Stop calling and texting. It&rsquo;s over. Her: Wow. A text message? Seriously? After five years that&rsquo;s all I get? You can&rsquo;t even be man enough to talk it out?Me: Stop being pathetic and move on as I have. Her: Did you think I was pathetic when you begged me to keep your baby? Wow. This is when I realised that this was Eric&rsquo;s almost-baby momma. Her: You cold-hearted bastard. We are totally through. I&rsquo;m sorry that I ever met you. And I&rsquo;m so glad that I terminated that pregnancy. Rot in hell.
