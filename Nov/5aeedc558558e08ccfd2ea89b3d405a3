Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) has accused Urban Planning officials of abetting the mushrooming of kiosks in Busia town. Speaking in his office after the swearing in of nine Busia Town Management Committee members on Monday, he said the trend is worrying. The big question is, who licensed them to operate? It appears there is collusion between some of my officers and the operators, which we have to find out.Kiosks are mushrooming even at the bus stage, where commuters board vehicles. Planning officials need to be proactive and give residents the best services, Ojaamong said. He said the committee should strive to make Busia attractive for Kenyans and East Africans. That is the direction to go. We need to plan and re-arrange Busia and Malaba border towns, Ojaamong said. Busia town has buildings more than six decades old. We need modern structures, good drainage and water systems and planning for business, residential and institutional development, he said.The governor said Busia and Malaba town committees should restore sanity . He said the buildings should be painted with uniform colours. Busia Town Management Committee chairperson Sheila Kituyi urged the governor to help upgrade the town into municipality status as it hosts the county headquarters.
