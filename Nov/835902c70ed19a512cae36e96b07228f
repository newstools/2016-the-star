Kenya has given the ICC a cold shoulder after it failed to send a local delegation to the Assembly of State Parties scheduled for Wednesday this week at The Hague.Attorney General Githu Muigai said Kenya will be represented by its ambassador to Netherlands, Makena Muchiri.This is the first time Kenya is not sending a high powered delegation to the ASP since the ICC set its eyes on the country following the 2008 post-election violence.Kenya used the previous ASP meetings to push for reforms and fight the cases that had been brought against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.Commentators have been speculating which country will next quit the Hague-based court after Burundi announced in October 2016 that it had decided to withdraw from the Rome Statute - International Criminal Court s founding treaty.South Africa went ahead of Burundi to the finish line by providing the UN Secretary General with a formal notification, therefore becoming the first state to invoke Article 127 of the Statute.The move has been judged as likely to ignite more exits from the court, in the face of concerted efforts by the African Union to install its own resolution mechanisms for crimes tried at the Hague.Kenya has a particularly fraught history with the court because of the ICCs decision to prosecute six senior officials and politicians. These include President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto who were elected while facing charges of crimes against humanity. All the Kenyan cases were judged a mistrial on grounds of lack of sufficient evidence to withstand trial of the accused persons.More on this: What s at stake as Kenya weighs withdrawal from the ICCKenya s President Kenyatta has lately been one the most vocal voices calling for African states to stage a mass withdrawal.And African government officials continue to express serious reservations about the ICC.Shortly before making the announcement that it was withdrawing, South African President Jacob Zuma met Kenyan leaders in Nairobi, suggesting some form of coordination may have taken place.Read: Stay and fix the ICC, African Union hopeful urges peersAlso read ICC's toughest trial: Africa versus 'Infamous Caucasian Court'
