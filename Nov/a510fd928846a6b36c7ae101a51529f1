Visiting Tanzanian President John Magufuli was yesterday caught in a traffic jam on Uhuru Highway.He was heading to State House to meet his host, President Uhuru Kenyatta.Magufuli, who is on his first tour of the country after his inauguration as Tanzania s fifth President, was caught unawares in the early morning traffic after leaving a hotel.A contingent of elite President s Escort police attached to him had to use sirens to clear the way.At State House, the two leaders discussed, among other issues, the candidature of Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed for the position of Africa Union Commission chairperson.It could not be established, however, whether traffic police manning the Haile Selassie Avenue roundabout had prior briefing on Magufuli s movement.The Tanzanian President had earlier walked from the Hotel Intercontinental, where he is staying, to the Jomo Kenyatta Mausoleum, in Parliament grounds, to lay a wreath.Known for his humble and simple demeanour, Magufuli seemed unperturbed as the traffic slowly eased. He was accompanied by a small motorcade, short of the usual extravagant cavalcades of other visiting heads of states.Yesterday, Magufuli was accorded full military honours, complete with a 21-gun salute, upon arrival at State House.Magufuli s visit gives the two neighbouring countries a chance to renew and deepen their partnership in a number of fields.
