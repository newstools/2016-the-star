Residents seeking services tomorrow will find deserted offices instead, if 13,000 county employees make good their threat to strike over unpaid Sh1.2 billion October salaries.The employees, under the umbrella of the Kenya County Government Workers Union, said City Hall gives unconvincing reasons for the delay. Despite this union s protests against this malpractice and unfair labour practice, the situation has only worsened. To date, our members salaries for the month of October 2016 have not been paid, secretary general Boniface Waweru said. The county has been telling us there are problems with Ifmis and that is why Central Bank has not released the money. But we find this not convincing, he said.Waweru said they will march outside City Hall from tomorrow until their salaries are paid. The information and excuses they give us are not helpful. If Ifmis is not working, they should go back to the manual system. We re sure the county has received money from the national government, he said.County secretary Robert Ayisi admitted the employees have not received their October pay, but blamed it on system failure. He said this has delayed the disbursement of the money by the Central Bank. Our team, led by Finance chief officer Luke Gatimu are at the Central Bank, as we speak, trying to solve the problem, Ayisi told the Star on the phone yesterday. They will be paid as soon as this matter is resolved. The city relies entirely on money allocated by the national government for remunerations.Governor Evans Kidero has on many occasions said Nairobi has a bloated wage bill. He said more than 80 per cent of the allocation from the national government is used to pay employees.
