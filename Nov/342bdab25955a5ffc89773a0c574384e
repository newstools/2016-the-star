Celebrated singers The Longombas left the country over 9 years ago to seek out greener pastures in the US of A. Since then, the duo - made up of siblings, Christian and Lovy - has released a few singles like Queen and What You Like.Christian continues to pursue his music and you will soon be seeing some of his releases. This comes after his miraculous recovery from brain surgery to remove a tumour. This was one and a half years ago.Now, I have just come across some videos of Lovy who seems to have taken a completely different career path. That of a preacher, healer and prophet.Lovy is the lead pastor at the Revelation Church Of Jesus Christ based in California. The church has a young following drawn from different races, based on photos on the church&#39;s Instagram page.&nbsp;The church posted three videos of Lovy Longomba praying for an elderly woman who claims she had eyesight problems and at the end of the prayers, she gets healed.The woman, identified as Lucy Zavala said, &quot;They told me there was no cure. No cure at all. Any my eyes has been going less and less but now I can see more. What can I say? I don&#39;t even know what I can say. All I can say is, wonderful, wonderful! And everybody should believe because I do. I believe.&quot; Check out the videos of the prayer session that led to the healing of Lucy Zavala.&nbsp;&nbsp;RCJC TESTIMONY: BLIND EYES HEALED IN JESUS NAME: Part 1 . &quot;Say to those who are fearful-hearted, &ldquo;Be strong, do not fear!
