Raila Odinga is hoodwinking Kenyans on corruption in an effort to derail the government&rsquo;s development agenda, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. Uhuru said&nbsp;the opposition leader has no clear agenda for the country and has championed propaganda throughout his political career. He referred back to 2007 in saying economic growth reached&nbsp;seven per cent, but that Raila spread politics of hatred, ultimately ruining the prosperity that was being witnessed. &ldquo;The problem in this country is bad politics. We are focusing on negative and divisive politics. Recently, when we allocated money to put up a referral hospital in Nanyuki, to ease pressure for Nyeri Hospital, the same person said money had been stolen,&rdquo; he said. He spoke in&nbsp;Naromoru, Nyeri county, on Monday when he launched the construction of Narumoru-Ngaring&rsquo;iru-Ngobit road.

Uhuru said the newly commissioned road will ease the movement of people and goods, and access to markets for farm produce. &ldquo;This is historical. For the first time, we are launching the construction of a tarmac road in Laikipia County,&rdquo; said President Kenyatta. The President also announced that the government has set aside Sh80 million for the modernisation of Naromoru hospital. Uhuru noted that residents travel long distances to Nyeri town for services that could be provided once the hospital upgrade is completed. &ldquo;The millions we are allocating to this hospital are for putting up a modern theatre, ex-ray machines and other modern equipment,&rdquo; he said. The President also commissioned&nbsp;the construction of a modern market at Chaka trading center, a model which he said will be replicated across the country. Uhuru said the&nbsp;market will be a one-stop-shop for all activities as it will serve wholesalers, retailers and value addition industries. &ldquo;This market, in addition to serving farmers will also have banking services and all that is required by shoppers,&quot; he said.
