Ushuru inched a step closer to retaining their top flight status as they battled to a goalless draw at already relegated Nairobi City Stars in a Sportpesa Premeir League clash played in Ruaraka yesterday.The point improved Ushuru&rsquo;s tally to 26 points four better than Sofapaka who face Mathare United this afternoon.Even though the chips are firmly down for Ushuru they failed to close the deal on their survival as their winless run stretched to 13 matches against a side that had already relinquished their place in the top tier league.The football was vastly improved from previous weeks with Nelson Marosowe stricking a free kick narrowly wide for the tax men after just eight minutes.Ken Kenyatta&rsquo;s men played on the front foot for much of the encounter and Dennis Wafula should have done better than to feebly shoot at Ronny Kagunzi when an opportunity was fashioned for him by a combination of Barrack Odhiambo and Kennedy Oduor.It took City Stars a while to get going but it is them who could have opened the scoring only for Jimmy Bageya&rsquo;s effort to canon off the crossbar.Both sides made changes after the break with Ushuru bringing on Maurice Odipo and Tony Nyangor while Ezekiel Odera came on for City Stars. Oscar Mbugua headed over from a promising position when he was picked out by Marosowe but clear cut chances failed to materialise until Nyangor dragged his shot wide with fifteen minutes elft to play as the tieended in stalemate.Today resurgent Sofapaka face a vulnerable Mathare United side that recorded their eighth loss of the season last weekend against defending champions Gor Mahia. Sofapaka will come into this match buoyed by their surprise 3-2 win over AFC Leopards last weekend.Free kick specialist Noah Abich, now at Sofapaka, will be facing his former employers and is likely to create all sorts of problems for them.The slum boys, who have fizzled out after so much promise, will miss Edwin Seda and Roy Syamba who are nursing long term injuries.Meanwhile the Champions League enters it&rsquo;s crucial stage this weekend.The two losing teams at the semi final stage will square it out in order to get the second runners up in the entire league.Melta Kabiria who represented the West Conference will lock horns with hard fighting Shauri Moyo Blue Stars from East Conference.The winner will walk away with Sh100,000.
