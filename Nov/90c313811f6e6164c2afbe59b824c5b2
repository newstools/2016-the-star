He will then lead a political rally at the Homa Bay County Stadium, where local politicians are expected to use the platform to sell their agenda. Speaking on Wednesday in Waondo during a public baraza, Farrah said it is illegal for politicians to use the event to engage in premature campaigns, adding it could be a recipe for violence. Kajwang s memorial service is aimed at uniting Kenyans to remember his achievements. We don t expect anybody to campaign during the occasion. Whoever does so will be arrested, he said.Farrah said politicians who start early campaigns will be disqualified from running in next year s election. He said they will be monitoring very keenly what politicians say during the event. We ll consider writing to the IEBC those who incite people against their opponents so they are prevented from running, Farrah said.The administrator warned politicians and the youth against causing violence. Everybody needs to respect the opinions of other speakers to avoid any form of political bickering, Farrah said.He said adequate security personnel will be deployed to ensure it is conducted peacefully.Farrah added his office has deployed registration officials so residents can apply for national identity cards. I urge all youths aged 18 years and above to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire ID cards, he said.
