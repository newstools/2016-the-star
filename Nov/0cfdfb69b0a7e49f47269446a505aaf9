Health CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri today will face senators over the Sh5.3 billion Mafya House alleged misappropriation. According to an internal audit report, the money could not be accounted for. The committee chaired by Migori Senator Wilfred Machage gave the ministry two weeks to prepare a response after Mailu asked for more time to scrutinise the report. Machage has urged Kenyans to be patient and let investigating agencies conclude their work. The Senate cannot comment on this matter based on media reports. We need to get the facts right. So far, the only thing we can say is the CS will appear before us on Tuesday, he said. Cord has threatened to mobilise one million Kenyans to the streets of Nairobi today over the issue.
