National exams body KNEC has come under scrutiny after it emerged that one of the ongoing KCSE examination papers had glaring mistakes.Kiswahili Paper Two had to be delayed after students across the country identified three questions had anomalies, forcing their invigilators to seek directives from the council.According to a senior education officer, who declined to be named, said they were forced to call KNEC officials after the anomalies were noted."In one of the questions, the students were to refer to a statement that was supposed to be underlined but on checking there was nothing of the sort," the source said.In another question, according to the official, there were glaring spelling mistakes that confused the students.It also emerged that there were some questions that did not have enough space for writing answers."Officials from KNEC were informed and advised the students to use foolscaps," the education official said.There was confusion when the students were later advised against using foreign materials in the exam.The examination body issued another directive that the students transfer all the material back to available spaces on the examination paper."The students were given only five minutes to transfer their answers, which most of them termed as very unfair following the short time," the official said.A teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they don't expect any good results in the Kiswahili paper.The teacher said that the questions and directives from KNEC further confused students."There were conflicting directives from the ministry and mainly the examination body. This affected the confidence of some candidates," the teacher said.A student told the Star that they were not given ample time to answer the three questions which had anomalies.The student noted that they were caught by surprise by the directive that they answer some of the questions on the foolscaps.Read: KNEC allays fears of KCSE Mathematics, Chemistry exam leakAlso read: Principal arrested in Kitale over alleged bribery of KCSE supervisors
