National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale yesterday defended the Jubilee Party s request that the IEBC fund its party primaries.The Constitution allows taxpayers to fund political parties, as parties are not private entities but people-owned, he said in Parliament chambers.Duale defended President Uhuru Kenyatta s previous comments that they will look for money to fund the nominations. The President is the head of the Executive and when he said they would look for money to fund the primaries he was talking about the National Treasury, he said.The electoral agency was invited to handle party nominations to end past cases of corruption and even violence experienced during primaries and to promote democracy, Duale said. Democracy is expensive and must be funded by the taxpayers ... thus Kenyans should be ready to serve and work for it, he said.Duale added that any other party that wishes to have the IEBC handle its nominations should follow suit since it is a constitutional provision.Nomination Budgetary DebateLast week, Duale said that in two weeks the National Assembly will debate the budget allocations that will fund the nomination process.The debate comes after Jubilee Secretariat chairman Raphael Tuju dispatched a letter requesting the IEBC to get into negotiations on funds for the party nominations as agreed by the National Delegates Conference two months ago.If this proposal is to be enacted, the IEBC is expected to adjust its current budget of Sh45.4 billion meant for the 2017 general election.Previously, ODM leader Raila Odinga protested against the IEBC conducting nominations, terming it micro-management of political parties.
