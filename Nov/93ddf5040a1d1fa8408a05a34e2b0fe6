It was dry over much of the area, including the Athi River basin. In the distance, a rolling cloud of dust moved. Then looking again with binoculars, we saw them. The entire cloud was caused by hundreds of wildebeest (gnus) as they moved in the valley, driven by thirst to return.We drove down to the river road and stopped to watch as the wildebeest crossed the road and went past us. What a fantastic sight to witness, an event that does not happen very often.There hadn't been this many of them since September 2007, when more than 1,000 wildebeest migrated during the extended drought, when so many cattle also died. The wildebeest that come into the park are the eastern white-bearded wildebeest. This is a rare sub-species of gnu, which consists of less than 5,000 individuals east of the Rift Valley.Wildebeest are known by their nature to migrate over vast distances. In the past, the park often had thousands of them searching for pasture. Naturally, the lions also enjoyed this. Sadly, due to the Nairobi mega-city growing rapidly, the traditional migration routes are being throttled by fences and construction projects. The park is becoming a green island in a sea of construction . It will be a very sad occasion when the wildebeest no longer return.We hope many of the wildebeest will stay in the park this year, instead of trying to migrate through the throttling route , and give birth to many calves. Only time will tell if they continue with this behaviour and no longer migrate south due to human developments en-route.
