There will be as much supervision and strictness in the marking of exams as was witnessed during supervision, Education CS Fred Matiang i has said.He said the sacrifices made by principals and supervisors during the administration of exams will not be undone at the marking stage.Matiang i spoke in Bungoma town yesterday. I am warning those marking exams not to drop the ball. We will not let the sacrifices made go to waste, he said.Matiang i said principals had raised concerns their efforts to manage exams could be undone. We will use the most strict methods to conduct the marking of exams and this will bring confidence to our new system of managing exams, he said.Matiang i said no examinations had been leaked this year.He urged school administrators to get out of their comfort zones and work hard to ensure they deliver good results.Matiang i said schools should teach students the values of hard work and not try to get grades through dubious means. We should encourage our children to work hard. Don t let them value grades they have not worked for. It s not business as usual in exams in Kenya, he said.Matiang i said the coordination between the Education and Interior ministries has ensured the success in the management of exams.He said the cooperation will continue to ensure the smooth management of exams.In March, the Education ministry cancelled the KCSE results of 5,101 students and reported a 70 per cent rise in the number of cases of irregularities. About 2,975 cases of cheating were recorded in 2014. We had an unprecedented rise in exam irregularities in 2015. I apologise to the public for them. I will ensure it will not happen again. Let us all be responsible, Matiang i said.
