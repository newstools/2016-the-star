West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo has hit out at Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, saying he was a poor Pokot child who was helped by former President Daniel Moi to acquire education.He said if not for Moi s help, Kamama would not be holding any leadership position, adding he could be a poor man in the village.Kamama was quoted on Saturday saying his three terms as MP were not enough to transform the Pokot community that had been abandoned by preceding governments, especially under Kanu. He is seeking reelection.But speaking to the Star on Tuesday, Lonyangapuo said besides paying Kamama s school fees, Moi went ahead to appoint him to serve in government as a District Officer. After this, Kamama gained popularity that enabled him to get to be where he is today, he said. He should be grateful to the retired President and stop abusing the former Kanu regime that it did nothing to uplift the economy of the Pokot community, while he is a living beneficiary of the Independence party, Lonyangapuo said.He said Kamama is one of many people in the Jubilee administration, whose academic, social, economic and political successes are solely attributed to Moi. Some leaders have forgotten where they came from and are now talking ill of Mzee Moi and his Kanu regime. They could not have managed through life without him, Lonyangapuo said.He said the Pokots love Moi because of the good work he did for them, hence, Kamama should prepare to go home after the 2017 election for deviating from their course. We ll replace him with a vibrant Kanu candidate, he said, adding Kanu has countrywide support.
