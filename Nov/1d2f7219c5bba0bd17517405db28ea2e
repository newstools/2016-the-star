City Hall is saving more than Sh600 million every month after removing 2,000 ghost workers from the payroll and sending back another 800 to the national government.This brings the county s monthly wage bill to Sh1.6 billion, down from Sh1.8 billion.Public Service executive Mercy Kamau yesterday told the Star the ghost workers were revealed during three audits conducted since 2013. When we started the audit, we had almost 15,000 workers but today, we are about 13,000, she said.Kamau said employees were scaled down to 11,000, but the county recruited another 2,000 workers. The county inherited an unmotivated and divided workforce, with no structures for promotion, remuneration and training. Some staff had stuck in one job group for more than 10 years, while others lacked the necessary skills for the sectors they were deployed to work in, she said. We had a massive strike, which nearly paralysed service delivery. Kamau said the county launched a culture change programme to phase out the old kanjo mentality .There is now a well-structured corporate culture, which is service oriented, she said.Kamau said the county will continue to shrink its workforce by phasing out employees who have reached retirement age.She also said ICT will help cut down the workforce. The county aims to have a workforce of 8,000 people.About 60 per cent of the workforce is above 50 years. Almost 500 workers retire every year. We want the relationship between Nairobians and our workers to be positive. No hate, no suspicion, no pain, no brutality, Kamau said. We want to make Nairobi a place where you can walk in the streets and feel safe. A place you can see a city askari and run towards him, not away from him.
