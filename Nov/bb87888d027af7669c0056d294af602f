The Nairobi assembly Committee on Trade and Tourism yesterday petitioned Governor Evans Kidero to sack Trade executive Anna Othoro.Chairman Wilfred Odalo told the press that Othoro should be dismissed for incompetence and failing to adequately address the hawkers menace."We want as a committee to tell the governor that he should act. The elections are fast approaching and as a committee we will not sit back and allow a few people to derail service delivery in the county. Othoro has even usurped the powers of her chief officer by overstepping her mandate and haphazardly transferring staff to other departments," he said.Odalo added that Othoro has employed a foreigner to run the affairs of her docket."I know it will be said we are malicious. But the truth is that as a committee, we feel let down by the executive and action has to be taken. If Kidero does not take action, we will go to court," he said.This is not the first time the committee is calling for Othoro's sacking.The MCAs have occasionally accused Othoro of doing little to improve service delivery.But Othoro has always defended herself and asked the MCAs not to drag her into battles not her own.
