Two Health ministry chiefs yesterday were hard pressed to explain why one year after procurement 100 container clinics in the Slum Upgrading Programme are gathering dust.The National Assembly Health Committee questioned CS Cleopa Mailu and PS Nicholas Muraguri over the delayed distribution of 100 clinics costing Sh10 million each. The clinics have been lying at the National Youth Service centre in Mombasa. &ldquo;I thought the ministry prepared the ground and identified the destination of the clinics before purchase,&rdquo; Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu said. &ldquo;This committee should be told the amount used to prepare the ground and whether there was value for money.&rdquo;He accused committee chairperson Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South MP) of stalling and shielding Mailu and Muraguri by telling them to respond after the committee inspects the clinics. The MPs are to inspect clinics today. Muraguri said, &ldquo;The cost of preparing the ground differs. Some places have good ground and a container can easily be placed, while others don&rsquo;t.
