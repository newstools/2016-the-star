The Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority has settled about 0.19 per cent of the about Sh5.97 billion surrendered by firms by mid last month, underlining the challenge of reuniting the cash with owners or beneficiaries.The statutory body charged with location and recovery of idle cash said it has paid out Sh11.56 million to 149 claimants out of the total claims worth Sh76.78 million in 1,949 claims. There were 235 verified claims awaiting board's approval as at October 19, chief executive Kellen Kariuki said. Out of that, 27 claims had been cleared and were awaiting payments. We are investing a lot in education and awareness to deepen compliance on one hand and reunification on the other, Kariuki said via an email.The Unclaimed Financial Assets Act, 2011 obligates banks, insurers, brokerage firms, pension funds and utilities including mobile money service providers to surrender unclaimed cash to the authority by November 1 of every year. This include cash in accounts that have been dormant for years and whose owners cannot be traced as at end of June, every year.The authority, however, started working fully in January 2015 after Kariuki and other senior managers were hired, while regulations to facilitate payments were approved earlier this year by the National Assembly under the Statutory Instruments Act, 2013.The authority said the cash in the Unclaimed Assets Trust Fund account at the Central Bank of Kenya was Sh5.97 billion on October 19, almost double from about Sh3 billion during the same period last year.A further 114.62 million shares worth $3.3 million (Sh335.02 million) have also been reported, UFAA said.Commercial banks accounted for the lion's share of the assets at Sh3.81 billion or 63.87 per cent of the total value, followed by companies trading their shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange had surrendered Sh1.16 billion or 19.45 per cent of the total.Insurance firms, mobile money firms, retirement schemes and Saccos had Sh638.32 million, Sh314.88 million, Sh22.44 million and Sh14.12 million. The remainder Sh6.63 million was submitted by other firms including distributors and law firms, the authority said.UFAA has entered into memorandum of understandings with Capital Markets Authority, Insurance Regulatory Authority, Retirement Benefits Authority and the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority to ensure firms comply.Kariuki said the authority has further inked another MoU with the Interior ministry, giving it access to the Integrated Population Registration Database system to verify identification documents presented by claimants for faster reunification of the assets. These MoUs provide for co-operation between the authority in various aspects key to the enforcement of the Act, including the exchange of regulatory information, the taking of enforcement measures, and the sharing of regulatory standards amongst other areas of cooperation, she said.
