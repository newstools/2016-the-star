Mouth-watering battle set for Nakuru Athletic ClubKenya Cup champions Kabras face Nakuru in a highly anticipated Kenya Cup clash at the Nakuru Athletic club today.The hosts got a rude shock last week when they were hammered 33-3 by KCB at the Lions Den in Ruaraka.Despite a promising start with two wins over Mwamba (26-11) and Mean Machine (41-7), the Wanyore have looked shaky at best and will have to be at their best to subdue the sugarmillersCoach Enos Otieno knows this could be a defining game of the season for his charges. &ldquo;We were outplayed by KCB last week. We have looked at the mistakes we made and are looking at playing better against Kabras,&rdquo; added Otieno.Otieno will want to see his side being competitive at the setpiece and win the collisions at the gainline against a robust Kabras outfit who have won their three opening matches beating Mean Machine (14-13) , Western Bulls (17-8) and Mwamba (20-11). &ldquo;It will be a tough battle upfront especially in the forwards.
