A team has been set up to study how Kenya can position itself as the most preferable destination for conference tourism.The convention bureau was tasked with finding ways to increase the number of events, conferences and meetings among other roles.Among those to be gazetted as part of the team is President Uhuru Kenyatta's niece Nana Gecaga.Tourism CS Najib Balala said the team will be facilitated with Sh100 million to conduct the study within 60 days. The group will be chaired by J S Vohra; Charles Campbell, Anne Murungi, Jeffers Miruka, Mohammed Abdullahi, Vicky Muyanga and Mohmud Jammohamed will serve as members.This follows the many international conferences that were hosted in Kenya, attracting thousands of delegates.Balala said the ministry is keen on turning around the sector in order to increase the number of visitors to the country."In the last two years, we have been holding very high profile business meetings which have been very fruitful in creating business opportunities," Balala said."This is a sign of Kenya being a popular destination and is giving a sense of confidence in the economy," he said at his office on Wednesday.Balala said that while leisure tourism in the country has been impacted by current global perceptions of security situations, the industry is turning to the travel business segment."This is to make up the shortfall with emphasis being meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE)," Balala said.The CS said that according to World Travel and Tourism Council, leisure spending generated 62.5 per cent of direct travel and tourism GDP in 2014.Balala said that business spending has however been growing as it generated 37.5 per cent of direct GDP in 2014, up from 34.6 per cent in 2013. He said the segment is anticipated to increase by a further 5.4 per cent, to reach Sh150.9 billion in 2015."The World Travel and Tourism Council forecasts project growth of 5.3 per cent until 2025, reaching Sh252 billion," he said.Leisure spending is expected to grow by just 2.8 per cent in 2015 totaling Sh245.3 billion by the end of the year."I have instructed KICC to start planning on expansion of a place required because we need another Tsavo within the ground floor," he said.At the same time, the ministry formed the tourism protection unit tasked to strategise on how security within the sector will be enhanced.The protection unit is headed by conservationist Ali Kaka and is tasked to present their report in 60 days.The agency has representatives from the police, NYS, Utalii college, KWS among others.Read: Kenya s tourist arrivals increase by 14 per centAlso read: Tourism television station launched locally to promote the industry
