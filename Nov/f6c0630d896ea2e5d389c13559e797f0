Some Laikipia leaders have demanded the removal of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery over the spate of attacks in the county.They are Laikipia East MP Anthony Mutahi, nominated legislator Sarah Lekorere and Jubilee Party interim chairperson Christopher Maitho. There has been a conflict between farmers and armed Samburu herders. The leaders said the CS has failed in his mandate of protecting lives and property.Nkaissery is partisan in discharging his duties and does not deserve to be in the security docket, the leaders said on Sunday. Mutahi and Maitho said while local leaders are busy restoring sanity, Nkaissery is engaging criminals in sideshows.Lekorere said the three-month wave of insecurity in Laikipia is a creation of leaders, who are the owners of thousands of cattle grazing on private farms, and the communities are just being used as scapegoats to hide the truth.
