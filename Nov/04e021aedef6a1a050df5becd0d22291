The Embu Council of Elders has disclosed it will choose an aspirant for Senate seat to replace incumbent Lenny Kivuti, who will run for governor.Nyangi Ndiiriri Council of Elders of the Embu community on Thursday said it will partner with the Ngome Council of Elders.They said they will &ldquo;go to Nairobi to bring a young man from the Mbeere community who has suitable leadership qualities for the post&rdquo;.The elders, led by chairman Andrew Ireri, spoke in the Majengo Mosque Hall, where they said they will make a choice because Kivuti violated a memorandum of understanding between the Mbeere and Embu elders before the 2013 general election.Ireri said the MoU stipulated that the position of governor should go to the Embu community because they are the majority. He said this was meant to ensure equitable sharing of power and resources. Ireri said they will not immediately disclose the name of their pick. Kivuti faces other aspirants from the Embu community.The elders urged residents to elect the young man they have chosen because he has all the necessary qualities to become senator. They said they have scrutinised him and they would never mislead the voters.The elders said they have appointed five people from among them to talk to each of the the five governor hopefuls on how to conduct peaceful campaigns.Those who have declared interest in wresting seat from incumbent Martin Wambora are Kivuti, management consultant Ktihinji Kiragu, former PS Cyrus Njiru and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire.The five chosen elders will report back to the council and update members on their talks with the hopefuls.
