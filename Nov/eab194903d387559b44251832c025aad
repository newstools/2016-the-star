Mandera has teamed up with World Bank to vaccinate 700,000 livestock against foot-and-mouth and pneumonia. The diseases are usually spread during the dry season due to movement of animals from one region to another. The region is experiencing a dry spell that has lasted well over six months. Teams of eight peoplewill be recruited to vaccinate at least 3,000 animals per day in each subcounty. The animals will be vaccinated especially along major livestock corridors to reduce deaths and losses faced during the dry, Governor Ali Roba said. The project was launched last year in Wajir, Marsabit and Turkana counties. Fifteen counties in arid and semi-arid areas have vaccination regimes. The ASALs are home to about 10 million Kenyans who own approximately 80 per cent of the country s livestock population.
