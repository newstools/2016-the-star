Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama yesterday skipped a Wiper meeting where it was announced that Kalonzo Musyoka will be endorsed as its presidential candidate on December 10.The party made the announcement after a National Executive Committee meeting, where members downplayed a tiff between Kalonzo and Muthama.&ldquo;There is no fallout within the party or between any of our leaders or members. What you say is a crisis has been manufactured, even probably by Jubilee, by blowing things out of proportion,&rdquo; Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said. He is the Wiper party&rsquo;s secretary general.Omar went on to blame the media for creating a storm in a teacup and avoided talk on Muthama&rsquo;s absence. &ldquo;He is addressing another presser ... We realised the movement at the Wiper and Cord levels must move froward,&rdquo; he said.Cord&rsquo;s more importantKalonzo gave Muthama a public dressing-down at the weekend at Sultan Hamud, accusing him of causing political divisions in the region. Kalonzo said Muthama was working secretly to deny him the Cord presidential ticket in favour of ODM leader Raila Odinga. Muthama skipped the NEC meeting held mid-morning and chose to address a Cord press conference alongside Siaya Senator James Orengo. He said the Cord press conference was more important than Wiper&rsquo;s meeting.&ldquo;I was not at the Wiper meeting because what is happening here is more important than what they are discussing there,&rdquo; the senator told journalists at Capitol Hill. He was with Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Eseli Simiyu. Muthama and Orengo had called the press conference to give Cord&rsquo;s position on the IEBC and its preparations for next year&rsquo;s elections.The Wiper leader has insisted he should be the Cord flagbearer in 2017 after playing second fiddle to Raila in 2013, as his running-mate.Even as Omar insisted that all is well between Kalonzo and Muthama, unconfirmed reports indicate that the Machakos senator may be headed to ODM.
