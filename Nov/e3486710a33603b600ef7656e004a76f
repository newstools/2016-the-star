Armed thugs on Wednesday attacked a family in Matungu and killed a domestic worker. House owner Leonida Kusa and her nine-year-old daughter Saida were seriously injured.Mumias DCIO Robert Mureithi said the thugs sneaked into the home during day and hid in one of the rooms before they attacked the family at 7.30pm. They held the domestic worker and the young girl hostage, as they waited for the woman, who operates a retail and M-Pesa shop, at Matungu shopping centre to return, he said. They attacked the woman with sharp objects inflicting serious injuries on her. Mureithi said the young girl was seriously injured on the head. The young girl had blood oozing from the ears. Police went to the kitchen, where they found the body of the young man lying in a pool of blood. He was tied with a rope, he said.Mureithi said police recovered a metal bar covered in blood near the fence. They suspect it was used in the attack.Mureithi said the thugs took three mobile phones and Sh5,000 from Kusa. We suspect the gangsters were neighbours known to the houseboy and their motive was to steal from the family, he saidNeighbour Erina Susan said the path to the main road passes next to Kusa s house. Our visitor, who was passing by, heard cries from the house and ran back to alert us. We rushed to the house and found Kusa and her daughter in a pool of blood and writhing in pain, she said.
