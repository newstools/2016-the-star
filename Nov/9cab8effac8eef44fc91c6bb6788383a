"It is a decision that has safeguarded the much admired reputation of our defence forces, built over many years of dedicated and professional service to humanity both at home and abroad," the statement dispatched on Friday said. "The dismissal of Lt. Gen Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki, former Force Commander of United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) is not an individual matter. It touches on the fundamentals of our participation in the UNMISS as a country," the ministry said. "Kenya, as a good standing member of the International community was approached, in the light of its long history and experience, to provide leadership to this mission. The Government also believes that the dismissal was calculated to mask the functional and structural failures of the UNMISS," the statement said.Kenya ordered an immediate withdrawal of Kenyan troops last week, following the Ondieki's ouster.Ondieki was dismissed by UN chief Ban Ki-Moon as the head of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan after serving for six months.While his sacking is unclear, a document highlighted Ban's expressed displeasure at how the UN missions in South Sudan handled the violence in Juba."It is regrettable that the Cord leadership, in its characteristic fashion has elected to politicise a decision touching on a Kenyan and Kenya," the ministry said."The decision should ordinarily be supported by all patriotic Kenyans. As the Commander in Chief of the Defence Forces of the Republic of Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta recognised his obligation, as enshrined in his oath of office, to protect this republic and its citizens," the ministry said.
