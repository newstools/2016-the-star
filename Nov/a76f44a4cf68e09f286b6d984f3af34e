A Nairobi court has allowed the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit to continue holding two madrassa teachers with suspected Al Qaeda links for five more days to complete investigations.ATPU says Shabir Otieno and Abdallah Tumbo, both from Nakuru, have undergone intensive training in Iraq. The two are on the international watch list of Al Qaeda operatives and investigators believe they have been radicalising youths in their institutions.Yesterday Cyrus Ikade, an investigator attached to the ATPU, told the court Otieno and Tumbo have also been in communication with known al Shabaab suspects serving sentences at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. We have since found out that the two suspects are on an international watch list as al Qaeda operatives, Ikade told magistrate Hellen Onkwani when he sought more time.Otieno and Tumbo were arrested on October 30 at the Namanga border on their way back from Tanzania. He said the suspects have travelled to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.Among documents in their possessios were pictures and documents police believe they have been using to radicalise youths in Nakuru. Phone exploitation and analysis of the two have been done and found to obtain al Shabaab literature and articles that may be used to instigate and to commit terrorism, the officer said.The suspects first appeared in court on October 31, but were not required to plead to any charges.Police said releasing them will hurt investigation.
