Two Kanu politicians have praised Raila Odinga's Cord coalition for putting the government on its toes in the fight to ensure public funds are not embezzled.West Pokot Senator John Loyangapuo and Civil Aviation Authority chairman Samuel Poghisio said the opposition coalition has helped save taxpayer funds.They asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to cooperate with Raila and others in the opposition for it to be able to carry out its mandate.&ldquo;The government should allow cord to perform its duties. In every country there must be an opposition that acts as the watchdog,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said in Kaibos on Saturday.His remarks came after Uhuru accused Raila of peddling propaganda and lying to the public about development projects to demean his administration.The two have traded accusations as more corruption scandals continue to arise under Jubilee's rule.The President once told the Cord chief to let him enjoy "feasting on meat" as his goals are clear, and said he was confused.[VIDEO] Get your house in order, let Jubilee feast on 'meat', Uhuru tells RailaAlso read: Angry Uhuru turns Jubilee meet into Raila attack arenaLoyangapuo assured residents that Kanu will support Jubilee but said it will not merge with Jubilee Party.&ldquo;Kanu doesn&rsquo;t have a presidential candidate," he noted, but added that the party was not ready to lose its identity.Poghisio said their party was not the Jubilee administration's enemy as portrayed by other leaders in the county.&ldquo;We are fighting to see that Kanu remains strong in this county and nation at large. We are not moving to join Jubilee but we shall support Uhuru," he said.The two leaders also noted that their party holds Kenya's history and that Jubilee lacks structures proper enough to carry the weight of such a reputation.Lonyangapuo, who is gunning for governor, and Poghisio, who has set his sights on the senator post, asked leaders from other counties to drum up support for JP and respect elected leaders.&ldquo;We are not barring anybody from visiting this county but when they come they should not insult elected leaders,&rdquo; said Poghisio.Lonyangapuo said all parties were free to hold meetings at all locations and asked opponents not to disrupt them by hiring goons&ldquo;We need peaceful campaigns and elections free from violence,&rdquo; he said.Read: Poghisio to run for W Pokot senator on Kanu ticket
