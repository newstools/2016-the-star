Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma (pictured) yesterday said he is sure of reelection after a poll placed him at the top. Ranguma said his track record speaks volumes. He told those spreading propaganda against him to engage in issue-based politics. Last month, a poll by Millesta Communication and Research placed Ranguma in the lead at 51 per cent, while Senator Anyang Nyong o was second with 11 per cent.
