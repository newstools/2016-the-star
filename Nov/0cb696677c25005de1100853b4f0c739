Taxi-hailing firm Uber yesterday said new rides have doubled following price cuts in Nairobi in July.The US-owned firm said the 35 per cent price reduction has helped driver partners recruit new customers, leading to more trips recording more than 100,000 site visits per month. We are continuously watching and reviewing the effects of the price cut and we are thrilled that the results show that the price cut is working, Uber Kenya general manager Nate Anderson said.The increase in requested rides, Uber says, has increased driver partner productivity while reducing hours spent on the road by the driver partners. Uber has partnered with other companies to offer them extra benefits for their small businesses.The firm introduced its vehicle solutions programme through Sidian Bank that provides loans valued at Sh10 billion ($100 million), offering qualifying driver-partners up to 100 percent finance deals on vehicles priced between Sh1 million and Sh1.5 million.Drivers in partnership with Total Petrol Station receive Sh3.50 off every litre of petrol every time they fuel at the stations.
