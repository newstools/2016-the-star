The prosecution will provide "graphic and chilling details" of the murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others, a court heard on Thursday.The team said this as the trial of five people accused of killing Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri began.Four of the suspects in the case are AP officers Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Mwangi, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku, who have all denied the charges.The fifth suspect - Peter Kamau alias Brown - is believed to have driven the taxi that the three used before they were abducted, tortured and killed.The prosecution is expected to provide evidence that the suspects took part in the murder of the three people.The team said in its opening remarks that it will provide that it will detail how the plan was executed.The scheme, it said, was orchestrated by six suspects, one who is still at large. The court heard that the plan was hatched on June 22 at a hotel in MlolongoThe prosecution further said it had "direct and overwhelming" circumstantial evidence that will prove the five suspects killed the three men and dumped their bodies in the river, in a desperate attempt to cover-up their heinous acts.Among the pieces of evidence is a tissue paper note believed to have been written by one of the three men while they were under captivity.Justice Luka Kimaru ruled in August that the three men were abducted and illegally held at a container at the Syokimau APs camp before they were killed.He said a witness who rode by the camp heard someone make a distress call and that the person threw out a tissue paper message for his family to be called. It is believed KImani wrote the note a few hours before he was killed at a plantation owned by Delmonte.The note written in Kiswahili reads: "Tafadhali piga hii number mwambie Rose Willie na Mwenda wameshikwa na wako Syokimau, na wako hatarini."This translates to: "Call this number and tell Rose that Willie and Mwenda are being held in Syokimau and are in danger."More on this: Protesters burn Syokimau AP camp where murdered lawyer was heldKimani, 32, and the two others went missing on June 23 after attending a session at Mavoko law courts.
