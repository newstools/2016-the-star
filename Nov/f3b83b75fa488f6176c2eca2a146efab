Murang a Senator Kembi Gitura has dismissed allegations that he presented a fake document to the Senate Public Accounts and Investments committee in a bid to malign Governor Mwangi Wairia.On Thursday last week, Kembi presented a land valuation document indicating 34 acres the county bought at Sh340 million was valued at only Sh194 million by a private valuer paid by the county assembly.On Friday, Murang a MCAs, led by majority leader Peter Kihungi, accused Kembi of presenting a forged document to the committee and lying that it originated from the assembly.The senator said he received the document from the county assembly and the land issue was one of the 29 grounds MCAs listed in the motion to impeach Wairia in 2015. The Senate rejected the impeachment.Kembi, who is also the Senate deputy speaker, expressed disappointment with MCAs accusing him of forgery. He questioned why they have denounced a report they themselves prepared.The MCAs said they did not procure the services of a private valuer for the land and their issue was the procurement process the county used to buy the land. While addressing journalists in Murang a town on Monday, Kembi said he will not relent and will ensure the governor answers questions on why the land was overvalued and who pocketed the extra money. I want to tell Wairia and the MCAs that they will regret the statement they issued to the media saying I had forged a document, he said.Kembi said he will not sue for defamation because it would divert attention from the issue of irregular use of funds. But if they truly believe the document I presented was fake, then let them take me to court, he added.Kembi proposed formation of a panel of independent valuers to establish the value of the land.He also questioned why an industrial park has not been put up on the property bought for that purpose.The senator urged the anti-graft commission to conduct thorough investigations into the matter and ensure anyone incriminated in the land deal is prosecuted.
