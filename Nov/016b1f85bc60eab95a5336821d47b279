The Court of Appeal yesterday consolidated the extradition cases against journalist Walter Barasa who is supposed to be charged at the International Criminal Court.The case before judges GBM Kariuki, Alnashir Visram and Kantai ole Sankale will now be heard for two hours next year on a date to be fixed. Since the record of appeal is not properly arranged, the case is taken out and the appellant is ordered to correct the pagination before it is heard by the same Bench, Sankale said. Barasa is wanted by the ICC on charges of interfering with witnesses in the case against Deputy President William Ruto and Joshua arap Sang. He is accused by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda of offering Sh1.4 million to Witness No 536 if she agreed to withdraw as prosecution witness. Bensouda in September last year requested the help of the state for Barasa s extradition after obtaining an arrest warrant from ICC judges.The cases against Ruto and Sang have been terminated. The ICC ruled in April this year that they had no case to answer as there was no incriminating evidence to sustain the cases against them. Ruto and Sang faced charges of crimes against humanity over the 2007-8 post-election violence that left about 1,333 people dead and more than 600,000 others displaced. High Court judge Richard Mwongo said he was satisfied with the reasons given by the Interior CS for the arrest and that there were no reasons to decline the request by Bensouda, hence he issued an arrest warrant. But Barasa went to the Appeal Court and it suspended his arrest, pending conclusion of the appeal.
