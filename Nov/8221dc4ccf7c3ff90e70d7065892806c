The Makueni woman representative has dismissed claims she is eyeing the county&rsquo;s top seat. Rose Mumo (pictured) yesterday told the Star on the phone she is still focusing on women&rsquo;s issues and will defend her seat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comfortable with my position. I will be in the race to secure back my woman representative position on the Wiper ticket,&rdquo; She said. Mumo said she will support Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana&rsquo;s reelection.
