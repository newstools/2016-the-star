The Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya yesterday said 43 cases on devolution are pending in the courts.He urged Chief Justice David Maraga to hasten the cases, as they have slowed down services in some counties. The Meru governor spoke after paying a courtesy call on the CJ at the Supreme Court. He said the high number of cases is a concern for governors. The cases have been in the courts for a long time and need to be cleared, Munya said. He said some land matters and new legislation passed by the counties were challenged in court and needed expeditious conclusion. Maraga promised Munya, who was accompanied by five governors, the cases will be cleared soon, as 31 judges are about to be hired. He said 19 judges have been interviewed to be posted to the Environment division and another eight to fill vacancies in the 34 High Courts. The Environment division deals with land matters. We will give the cases priority, as the pillars of the Constitution aim to see devolution become a success, Maraga said.The other governors were Mwangi wa Iria (Murang a), Jack Ranguma (Kisumu), John Mruttu (Taita Taveta), Julius Malombe (Kitui), James Ongwae (Kisii) and Martin Wambora (Embu).
