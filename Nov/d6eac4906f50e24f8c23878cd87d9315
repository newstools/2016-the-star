The government will soon implement the Kenya Ethiopia cross-border treaties to end perennial conflicts, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has said. This will be done when the two countries adopt the resolutions reached during a commissioners meeting in Mombasa. Delegates are in Mombasa for a three-day meeting. Officials from the departments of foreign affairs, internal security and immigration will review economic and social cooperation. Addressing commissioners yesterday, Nkaissery said it has been hard to address cross-border conflicts, leading to finger-pointing. There are areas we have to re look at when implementing the treaties so it can suit every country in terms of trade and social economic interests, he said.One of the pacts to be reviewed is a Sh20 billion deal signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn to end conflict and encourage development.
