The county government is becoming extravagant in its spending of limited resources by engaging in activities like bringing foreign musicians who add no value to the county, he said.

We have every right as taxpayers to be told how the funds were spent and what each trip achieved so that it does not look like senior officials were just on joyride at the expense of other projects, he said.
