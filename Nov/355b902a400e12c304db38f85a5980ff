The National Super Alliance will not trounce Jubilee in the 2017 general election, a CS and governor have said. Energy CS Charles Keter urged Jubilee supporters not to be shaken by opposition alliances. He dismissed the opposition's claims that the Jubilee administration has failed, saying the government has improved infrastructure, electrification, education, security and agriculture. Keter said the Jubilee Party was formed to unite all communities and avoid tribalism in leadership. The CS spoke at AIPCA Kanjuku Church in Gatundu North on Sunday. He was with Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and area MP Kigo Njenga. Keter said that during the campaigns consultations, they met with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and Kabogo and agreed that Uhuru would become the President. “We decided Uhuru will rule for 10 years and later we support Ruto in 2022. We are looking forward to arrive there no matter what the opposition will try to do,” the CS said. Kabogo said the impact of the Jubilee administration's projects has made it gain support countrywide. “The Jubilee government is strong. It has served this country regardless of who voted for it and who didn’t vote for it and this is why it has gained support from all corners,” he said. Kabogo urged church leaders to pray for peace as campaigns start. Njenga urged leaders to support each other to ensure residents are not incited to cause hatred and violence. He urged them to coax residents into electing Uhuru and Ruto go back to power. “We must respect each other to ensure peace and coexistence prevail. I believe we have supporters to send back Uhuru to State House,” Njenga said.
