The government has immediately withdrawn Kenyan troops currently deployed in South Sudan following the sacking of Lt-General Johnson Ondieki.Ondieki was dismissed by UN chief Ban Ki Moon as the head of the peacekeeping force in South Sudan after serving for six months.While his sacking is unclear, a document highlighted Ban's expressed displeasure at how the UN missions in South Sudan handled the violence in Juba.More on this: Ban Ki Moon sacks Kenyan Lt-General as head of UN mission in South SudanIn a statement on Wednesday, the Foreign Affairs ministry said they have rejected the UN's decision and will disengage from South Sudan's peace process."Instead of addressing these shortcomings directly, the United Nations has instead opted to unfairly attribute them to a single individual, in the name of the Lt. General Ondieki," the ministry said.Read: Kerry seeks 'momentum' in sending extra UN troops to South SudanThe ministry raised doubts in the manner the UN handled the matter, adding that Ondieki's dismissal "does not offer a sustainable solution to the recurring violence in South Sudan"."It is apparent to the government of Kenya that the continued deployment of its troops in South Sudan is no longer tenable and is inimical to their safety and well-being," the statement reads.The ministry said it will also discontinue its contributions to the Regional Protection Force."What is clear is that UNMISS suffers from fundamental structural and systemic days functionality, which has severed its ability to discharge its mandate since its inception."Ban's decision to dismiss Ondieki is attributed to a Special Investigation that indicated that the UN mission in South Sudan failed to adequately respond to violence during recent fighting in Juba.The report indicated there were conflicting orders among troops and control arrangements were inadequate, "while peacekeepers maintained risk-averse posture".It is said that Ban was "deeply distressed" by the findings and was outraged by the continued "betrayal of the people of South Sudan by too many of its leaders".
