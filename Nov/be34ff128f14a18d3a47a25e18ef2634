Hong Kong newly appointed captain Barbar Hayat is confident as their national team prepare to play Kenya in the ICC World Cricket League Championship matches at Nairobi Gymkhana this weekend.Hayat, 24, who was appointed to lead the 14-men squad to Nairobi, exuded confidence as they prepare play on the Kenyan soil for the first time since 1994. The boys are feeling good following our 2-1 series win over hosts Papua New Guinea last week. We are looking forward to play Kenya and I expect the two matches to be tough as the results will determine our progress to the next level, Hayat, who scored 82 in the third game at PNG said.Hong Kong are placed fourth with nine points from six matches, three points ahead of Kenya, who have also played same number of matches. We both have experienced players and fresh talent on board. All we need is to focus and I am sure we can make it to the top as a team, he said.Hayat, whose first major overseas Test will be against Kenya, said the victory over PNG will boost their confidence against the strong Kenyans. We are very happy with a 2-1 series victory it s a nice result although 3-0 would have been much more pleasing considering we only lost 20 overs out of the three games we played. We just had a bad period in that second ODI, said Hayat The team s attitude has been fantastic ever since we got back from the World T20. We sat down and had an honest chat as a group about where we wanted to go as a team, on and off the field. I am very happy with how the guys have responded."
