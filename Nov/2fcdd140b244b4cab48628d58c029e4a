The county has spent more than Sh1 billion on water since devolution came into started three years ago.He was feted in a ceremony in Nairobi on Saturday. Deputy President William Ruto, who presided over the function, praised Abdullahi and pledged more national government support.He said Abdullahi deserves all the accolades for allocating a huge chunk of the county s budget towards providing communities with water.The county government has sunk 136 boreholes throughout Wajir. Before that, only 93 had been sunk by the national government since Independence.

The event was organised by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and the Water Service Trust Fund. No more conflictsAbdullahi said acute water shortage is the norm up north, but his administration is on a mission to change that. Our efforts to improve water services will continue, he said after receiving his award.Abdullahi said boreholes have been sunk and residents no longer have to trek many kilometres in search of water. We can now say that as a county we have managed to significantly reduce the perennial water shortage and our people can get water from the nearest centre, he said.Abdullahi said the boreholes have helped reduce conflicts among communities. A lot of conflicts arose due to fights for the little water that was available for both animals and residents. The county s intention was to quench the thirst of suffering residents moving far and wide in search of water, he said.
