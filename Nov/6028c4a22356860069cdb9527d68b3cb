Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying he was ill-advised to withdraw KDF soldiers from South Sudan.He said Uhuru s move is regrettable , because it threatens diplomatic relations that Kenya has with the international community through the United Nations.Raila questioned if Uhuru was acting on UN Security Council advise or solely through anger . We see the President who has been displaying strange acts of rage and anger locally, taking this to the global stage, making decisions based on anger and emotion to the possible grave damage to Kenya, he said. The government announced the withdrawal of the soldiers after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sacked Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki early this month for failing to respond to an attack on a Juba hotel during the July attack.The first batch of 100 soldiers of the UN peacekeeping mission returned this week from Juba in what the government termed mishandling of Kenya by sacking Ondieki. Another batch of 100 soldiers jetted back to the country yesterday. The unilateral decision by the President to withdraw troops and further announcing that Kenya will discontinue its contribution of troops to the proposed regional protection force go against our established policy of engaging with the world, Raila said.
