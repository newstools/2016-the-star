Parliamentary Health Committee vice chairman Robert Pukose has alleged a plot to scuttle the Afya House probe.The Endebes MP defended embattled chairperson Rachel Nyamai in the face of allegations that the executive is using her to block investigations into the Sh5.3 billion alleged scandal.A section of members have launched a scathing attack against Nyamai, who is Kitui West MP, saying she has been "suppressing and silencing the right direction of questioning".Twenty of the 29 members have signed a petition seeking Nyamai's removal from the influential position.They have accused her of protecting Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu and Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri from accounting for the money.But the ministry has denied any money was lost during the tendering project. Mailu said only Sh3.2 billion was in question and that it was probably spent.Read: State points out gaps in Health audit reportBut Pukose told the Star in an interview on Friday that there is nothing like that. Those are mere allegations by outside forces keen on making sure the committee does not get into the bottom of the scandal."He added: Those peddling the allegations are part of a scheme by forces outside Parliament to divert attention in a wider cover-up plot. The committee wants Pukose removed from his vice chairman post, as he has allegedly been working with Nyamai to protest the ministry's top officials.Matungulu MP Makau Mule, who is one of those who have signed the petition, said the committee wants fresh leadership. The current leadership cannot allow certain questions. Whenever you raise them, they argue you are interfering with the orderly conduct of business," Mule told the Star on Friday."That is meant to shield suspects but we will not allow it."Read: MPs want chairmen out for hindering Afya House probe
