The ODM party has replaced Nairobi assembly chief whip David Mberia (Karen MCA) with Jaffer Kassam (Parklands).In a letter dated Monday, ODM executive director Oduor Ong wen said, The party has received recommendations from its leadership in the Nairobi county assembly regarding the changes desired therein to make its leadership responsive and effective. Mberia and majority leader Elias Otieno have been at loggerheads for a long time. Last month, Mberia was kicked out of his office by the county Public Service Board.This was after he clashed with Otieno over a motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero.Mberia had accused Otieno of failing to provide leadership in the majority side, leading to an ODM member, Samuel Nyang'wara (Viwandani), sponsoring the impeachment motion.Otieno, on the other hand, accused Mberia of belittling and disobeying him. Mberia, however, moved to court and obtained an order asking the board open the office.Mberia has denied receiving any information from the party, informing him of the replacement. My friend, these people are not serious... They are daydreaming, he said. Otieno was unavailable for comment.
