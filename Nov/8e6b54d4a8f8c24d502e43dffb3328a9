The Kenya Wildlife Service has warned Lamu residents against invading wildlife habitats as it leads to increased conflict.It says the problem has resulted in an overflow of wildlife into human residential areas, as they have nowhere to hide and live after their habitats were cleared for human settlement.Speaking in his office, county KWS commander Jacob Orale said the ever growing human-wildlife conflict is mainly because of invasion of wildlife habitats. He accused residents of Pandanguo, Bargoni, Kililana, Mashunduani, Kwasasi and Lake Amu in Mpeketoni of destroying forests and forcing wild animals to stray into human zones.Orale said the high influx of livestock from the neighbouring Tana River, Wajir and Garissa counties has led to the drying up of major sources of water for the wildlife. He said his office had written to conservancies to help sink boreholes and put up water pans for wildlife. The biggest challenge is the destruction of the environment, especially forests. Many herders have migrated to Lamu and that s a very big problem for us and the wildlife. People literally stay in homes belonging to these animals. That s why the animals roam, Orale said.
