Forums to educate Kenyan communities on the need to stop female genital mutilation have helped stop the practice in many areas, Anti-FGM board chairperson Lina Kilimo has said.Residents have been educated on the need to abandon it and instead focus on educating girls, she said yesterday. Kilimo spoke in Bomet during a training for 60 women on how to fight FGM.She said the reduction in the prevalence rate from 27 per cent to 20 per cent is a sign Kenya is winning the war on the female cut.Girls who have completed their KCPE exams are vulnerable and the board is working to discourage parents from making them undergo FGM, Kilimo said. After the cut, most girls are married off. The girls are better off educated than married off, Kilimo said. Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s wife Esther Rutto said they have mapped out hotspots in the county where FGM is common and they will hold educative forums in the areas.
