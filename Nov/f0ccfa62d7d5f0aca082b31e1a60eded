A historian has uncovered information indicating that US President-elect Donald Trump's father had been banished from Germany in 1905.Friedrich Trump, a German citizen, was banished from the country for failing to undertake military service.He was ordered to leave the kingdom of Bavaria after failing to inform authorities of his emigration to the United States in 1885."He failed to de-register from his homeland and had not carried out his military service, which is why the authorities rejected his attempt at repatriation, historian Roland Paul said on Monday.The decree orders the American citizen and pensioner Friedrich Trump to leave the area at the very latest on 1 May ... or else expect to be deported .Friedrich was born in Kallstadt, now in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in 1869.At the age of 16, the senior Trump emigrated to the United States to escape from poverty and also because of the gold rush.Initially, he joined the gold rush in Alaska then went on to run brothels for gold hunters in the area.He then started sending gold nuggets to his sisters who has already settled in New York and were trading in property.Friedrich briefly returned to Germany in 1901 where he fell in love with and married Elizabeth Christ and returned with her to the US.When she grew homesick and sought to go back to Germany, authorities blocked Freidrich's attempts to settle.Friedrich sent an appeal to Prince Regent Luitpold on February 27, 2905 but this was rejected, forcing the Trumps to return to the US where they settled in New York.Residents of Kallstadt now joke that the blame for Donald becoming the president-elect lies with German authorities who kicked his grandfather out.
