The High Court on Wednesday denied an application seeking to halt the prosecution of former NYS deputy director general Adan Harakhe and former chairman of the Ministerial tender committee Hassan Noor.Judge George Odunga said he was not in a position to issue any orders since the matter is supposed to be handled by the newly-established anti-corruption court. I will certify this case as urgent but I will not issue any orders because it is not before the correct division, he said.Odunga directed the registry to transmit the files before the anti-corruption division for further direction on Thursday morning.Harakhe and Noor had filed an application seeking to bar the DPP from authorising or preferring criminal charges against them in relation to the loss of Sh1.6 billion at the National Youth Service.Read: NYS scandal mars Hassan Noor endorsement for Mandera governorThrough their lawyer Roger Sagana, the two asked for temporary orders, saying they were apprehensive that the DPP was going to order they take plea on Thursday.Sagana also said the accused have already been summoned and are scheduled to appear before the EACC on Thursday to record statements.EACC has summoned Harakhe and Noor over procurement irregularities in the award of a tender for the supply and delivery of training materials worth Sh47.6 million."The decision requiring them to take plea is without justifiable reason and has been made in bad faith," Sagana said.But Odunga maintained that the two should appear before the anti-corruption court on Thursday at 9am.In his letter to the EACC, the DPP said there is sufficient evidence to charge Harakhe with abuse of office for issuing a local purchase order and authorising a payment to a company listed as Blue Star Enterprises.More on this: Harakhe job was part of plan to loot NYS Ouko reportThe specialised plant equipment and machinery for training material by the NYS were approved allegedly by the valuation tendering committeeIn their suits, Harakhe and Noor say the intended prosecution is a witch-hunt mission against them as the DPP and the EACC seeks to appease their masters. The intended charges against me are frivolous and vexatious and the intention is only to harass and embarrass me," Harakhe said. Noor said the decision to purchase the equipments was based on evaluation report submitted by the tendering evaluating committee.He said he was not involved in any manner whatsoever whether directly or indirectly in the evaluation committee. I discharged my duties in the ministry in good faith and in accordance with the constitution and public procurement disposal act, he added.Also read: I saved millions of shillings at the National Youth Service Harakhe
