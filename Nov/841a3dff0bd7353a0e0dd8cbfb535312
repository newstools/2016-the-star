The Sports Dispute Tribunal has urged Football Kenya Federation and Kenya Premier League to seek mediation over the composition in numbers of the local premiership.KPL has petitioned at the Tribunal over FKF&rsquo;s intent to promote four teams from the second tier league to the top flight stage. Whereas FKF wants the premier league to comprise of 18 teams, KPL who run the league insist on maintaining the 16-team format.SDT chairman John Ohaga asked the two parties to consider mediation as an avenue of charting the way forward for the Premier League.&ldquo;Would you consider mediation since both of you (the parties) come from the same background and you are pushing for the same agenda of football,&rdquo; said Ohaga.Both FKF and KPL agreed to seek mediation in the dispute. Geoffrey Obura, lawyer representing KPL said they were considering to settle the matter out of court.&ldquo;We had considered the same and I was surprised that I was scheduled for hearing today (Tuesday afternoon). I had talked to FKF&rsquo;s counsel about the same and agreed on mediation,&rdquo; intimated Obura. Ohaga also mentioned to the two parties that they can approach the Tribunal for mediation, as it is one of the functions of SDT. The appeal will be heard on November 22.
