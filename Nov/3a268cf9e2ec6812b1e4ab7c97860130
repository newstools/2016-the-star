Musalia Mudavadi has asked all opposition party leaders to finalise talks and form the National Super Alliance ahead of the 2017 general election.The Amani leader made the call on Friday to leaders including Cord co-principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya).He said all those opposed to President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee administration should embrace dialogue, unite and form the alliance as it is the only way to take over power.Mudavadi also said everyone against Jubilee, including teachers, cooperative societies and youths, should join the super coalition to ensure victory next year. We want to cooperate so as to remove Jubilee from power," he emphasised on Friday during a tour of Faza island in Lamu East.He said the ruling coalition has messed the country, following many cases of corruption since Uhuru and DP William Ruto took over in 2013.Mudavadi further said Jubilee cannot be trusted with leading the nation for another five years.He said former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru's grilling by the PAC, over the Sh1,6 billion NYS scandal, clearly showed corruption had stretched far and wide as she mentioned the office of the DP.More on this: Agitated Waiguru attacks Kabura, calls her puppet in Sh1.6b NYS fraudThe Amani National Congress leader further claimed Sh5.3 billion was stolen from the Health ministry yet the funds could have helped improve health standards.He further claimed the free maternity health scheme introduced by the national government was a scheme to steal Sh 6 billion annually as nothing was going on in public hospitals. 1.2 million children are born annually. As per the government calculation they spend Sh5,000 per delivery meaning each year they spend Sh6 billion. That goes to people s pockets, he said.He added that the national government was against devolution and wants everything controlled from Nairobi.But county governments have received Sh898 million for the free maternity programme for the first quarter of the 2016-17 financial year. This is the first time they have received the money in advance.More on this: Counties get Sh898m free maternity cashAlso read: Nation Media denies owning firm linked to Sh5.3 billion Mafya House scamMudavadi, who will conclude his tour today, was with Lamu Governor Issa Timamy, MPs Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), deputy party leader Kassim Tandaza from Kwale and area MCA Mohammed Abasi.Timamy said they were in full support of the Amanu manifesto which is under review.He said he chose to stick with Mudavadi because he stood by him when he was arrested after Mpeketoni attacks. I rejected Jubilee's offer for ANC and Mudavadi. He did not get many votes in Lamu but we want locals to vote overwhelmingly for him this time," he said.Agoi said they told Mudavadi to form the super alliance with other opposition leaders in order to get Uhuru out of office.He added: "A lot of money is being stolen. We want a super alliance that will bring together all opposition parties including ANC, ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya and Kanu."Bunyasi said: The super alliance is the only one which will defeat jubilee, and ANC should be in the forefront.Read: Uhuru allies anxious over Super AllianceAlso read: Amani gives Mudavadi green light for super alliance to defeat Uhuru
