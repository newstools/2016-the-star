The Tharaka Nithi government spent Sh8.8 million of the Emergency Fund budget to buy drugs for a private hospital without the county assembly s approval. Governor Samuel Ragwa yesterday told the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee that the county had to buy the medicine and some equipment for a mission hospital so it can treat patients, as nurses in public hospitals were on strike. He said the Sh14 million Emergency Fund Bill had been discussed in the county assembly but had not been printed and signed. The committee had questioned him on why the county spent money from the kitty to buy drugs and equipment for St Orsola Catholic Mission Hospital in 2013-14, a private facility, instead of Chuka District Hospital, a public health facility. According to the Auditor General Edward Ouko s report, Sh8,806,716 had been spent and Sh4.4 million committed in the vote book.
