With the penultimate weekend of the SportPesa Premier League approaching, very little has been settled in the key battles in the top flight league with the relegation of Nairobi City Stars the only certainty.The battle for the championship has been reduced to a two-horse race with Tusker still favourites to clinch the title as they only need to win in their remaining two matches. Brewers face the country s second most successful club, AFC Leopards this weekend before battling Gor Mahia on the final day of the season.Tusker came away unscathed in their tricky trip to Awendo, where many expected them to drop points with goalkeeper David Okello the hero, saving a first minute penalty from Amos Asembeka to set their brewers up on their way to a 1-0 victory, courtesy of a side-footed effort by Noah Wafula.The brewers have 55 points four better than Gor Mahia, whose next match is against a Muhoroni Youth side who pipped them to the KPL Top 8 trophy and would love to end Kogallos three-year reign as Kings of Kenya football.Ze Maria s side made sure that the fight for their crown will have to be extended for at least another seven days as they edged Mathare United 2-1. Chemelil Sugar (44 points), Western stima (43), Ulinzi Stars (42) and Mathare (42) in third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, have been assured of a place in the same tournament next year as they are certain to finish in the top half of the 16-team league.Not so for Kakamega Homeboyz, who produced a stunning performance to consign City Stars to the second tier league for next season with their 3-1 win. Homeboyz have 40 points, one more than Posta Rangers, who close up the top 8 but they all can be pipped at the finishing line by either of Sony (36), Muhoroni (35) and Bandari (34)On Friday, City Stars will play a key role to determine which team follows them out of the top division as they face free falling Ushuru, who are just three points above Sofapaka in the battle to beat the drop.
