Popular Malian musician Fatoumata Diawara has had her beautiful dreadlocks for over a decade now.The Bissa hit singer, who since kicking off her music career in the early 2000s has extensively toured the world, says that there has never been a better feeling than showcasing her 'Africanism'.She terms it "strange" how a lot of African women are turning to unorthodox methods to lighten up their skins, otherwise known as "bleaching"."I am very proud of my skin... and my hair. My locks are a sign that I am a true African," she says.Fatoumata adds that African women should not be running after synthetic hairs and sticking them on their heads for cosmetic beauty purposes."In my home country of Mali, we have many women and young ladies sticking all these "unnatural" hairs on their heads."There's one particular type called Brazilian. It's very popular."We have others who are obsessed with lightening up their skin. It's becoming a very strange trend now."My advice to them is to be natural. To be proud of their skin colour; and their kinky hair as well."It's so beautiful being African out there," she says.The 34-year-old songstress is visiting Kenya for the first time.Fatoumata is set to perform at the Safaricom Jazz Lounge alongside Cuba's Grammy nominee Roberto Fonseca and prolific Kenyan Afro-jazz band Shamsi Music.The show is slated for Saturday, November 5, 2016, at Uhuru Gardens along Lang'ata Road in Nairobi.
