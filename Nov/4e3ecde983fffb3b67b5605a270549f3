Farmers in Soi North ward, Elgeyo Marakwet county, are counting losses after marauding jumbos destroyed crops worth millions of shillings.The eight elephants from the Rimoi National Reserve destroyed watermelons worth more than Sh3 million in a week.Farmer Gilbert Serem on Sunday said the animals have destroyed watermelons worth Sh810,000 on his 2.5 acres. I have lost almost all my melons. I invested so much money and was expecting good returns, only for my produce to be destroyed by elephants, he said.Serem accused Kenya Wildlife Service officials of laxity in containing the jumbos and delays in responding to distress calls when the animals move out of the reserve.He said KWS rangers who visited farms on Sunday did nothing. We were left confused when the KWS officers blamed their seniors for the problems we are facing instead of offering solutions, Serem said. He urged the KWS to compensate farmers. County senior warden Dominic Kilonzo said the jumbos were migrating following heavy rains in Rimoi and Kapnorok game reserves. He said the jumbos left the reserve through the unfenced Kapnorok section.Kilonzo said the KWS will assess the damage and decide how much to pay farmers.
