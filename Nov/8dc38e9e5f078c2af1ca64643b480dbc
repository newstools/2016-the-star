Four youths affiliated to Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wairia and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau were charged with incitement yesterday in a Murang a court.The four were arrested following confrontations at the weekend over the county government offloading 10 tonnes of manure at Mumbi Grounds to allegedly deter Kamau from launching his manifesto this Saturday.The four were charged that on November 17 and 18, they organised residents to fight each other based on who they support.Nicholas Kirweru, Haron Shayo, Nicholas Kimani and Laban Kimunu were arraigned before principal magistrate Anthony Mwichigi.Shayo faced a second count of carrying a machete on the same day at the same venue and endangering the lives of residents.Their lawyers asked that they be released on bond, while the prosecution asked the court to release the suspects on punitive terms as the country is entering into the campaign period.The four were released on Sh20,000 bond, while Shayo was asked for a further Sh50,000 bond for the second count.The hearing is scheduled for January 16.
