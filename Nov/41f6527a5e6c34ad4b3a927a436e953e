Entrenched Corruption among politicians, tribalism, lack of transparency and accountability among responsible agencies have been cited as the major hindrances to free and fair elections in Kenya.According to a report by the National Crime Research Centre(NCRC) titled 'Election Crimes and Offences in Kenya' released yesterday, entrenched corruption among politicians ranked the highest at 33.8 per cent among challenges facing control of election crimes and offences followed by lack of transparency and accountability among responsible agencies at 21.4 per cent. Cash handouts at 13.8 per cent were also listed among the hindrances.NCRC has recommended the conducting civil education on voters, rights and good leadership , strict maintenance of law and order and stiff penalties on those who violate electoral laws and promotion of patriotism and national unity as the possible solutions to hindrances.The report also says that there is need to improve the investigative capacity of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission, National Cohesion and Integration Commission, and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission in emerging reported and unreported crimes and offences related to elections.NCRC also wants the prosecution and sentencing of electoral crimes and offences to be strengthened at the point of arrest, gathering of evidence, prosecution and sentencing with the Director of Public Prosecution and judiciary playing a role.Hate speech and hate crime jurisprudence requires more development through administrative policies, legislations and court precedents to address the poor record of convictions.NCRC also recommends that IEBC should profile election offenders irrespective of their roles and status in society and enforce zero tolerance policy on election related corruption.The use of election campaign money should also be regulated and enforced by IEBC to deter electoral malpractices like voter bribery.Justice Jessie Lessit who was representing the Chief Justice David Maraga said that the judiciary is prepared for the 2016 elections with the Judiciary Committee on Elections established in 2012 already in place.She said the team has a monitoring and evaluating election petition to ensure that judiciary staff are trained on election petition and cases are attended to in the first six months."There will be special magistrates to hear election petitions within six months and cases have to be complete within one year. They will be prepared to hear hate speech, arson, campaign violence and offences against women," Justice Lessit said.Attorney General Githu Muigai said it is the duty of the Judiciary to ensure that the country has peaceful, free and fair and transparent election." It is our duty to ensure that this country gets free and fair, peaceful and transparent elections. Our job is not to wait for crimes to be committed but to disrupt crime," Githu said.
