Kwale residents have said they are ready for a by-election should Governor Salim Mvurya, who was expelled by ODM, lose his position. They have warned ODM to be ready for a rude shock, as they will reelect Mvurya.The more than 300 residents addressed journalists at the Culture Centre in Kwale town on Wednesday. Sheikh Kassim Zani, who led the delegation, said they are behind the embattled governor.Resident Binti Raso said, We re ready for a by-election because the votes belong to us, not ODM. ODM should know it doesn t have Kwale support anymore. Despite their position, the Constitution provides that the deputy governor takes over for the remainder of the term if a governor vacates office. Therefore, there will be no by-election in Kwale, as ODM did not expel Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani.
