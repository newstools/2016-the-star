Busia leaders say they will resort to witchcraft to expose police officers they accuse of killing two watchmen and a 14-year-old girl.On Monday they demanded that senior officers in Butula who shield the guilty cops must be transferred or they will use black magic to find out who has blood on their hands.Led by Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa, they demanded action.&ldquo;We shall call upon elders to do anything possible to bring the perpetrators to book. We will dump evil spirits [on them] until we know who killed our people,&rdquo; Wangalwa said. He addressed the press in his office.Wangalwa was referring to the murders of two elderly night guards and a 14-year-old girl last week. The guards were killed on Tuesday night. On Wednesday police officers followed the killers&rsquo; trail using a sniffer dog to the area&rsquo;s AP camp.They called off the probe, angering residents and sparking protests. Police shot to disperse the crowd, in the process killing the girl and injuring three people, admitted in hospital.&ldquo;Why was a sniffer dog following leads to the killers stopped from identifying perpetrators in the AP camp?&rdquo; Wangalwa asked. &ldquo;We demand all perpetrators be brought to book. Attempts to cover atrocities will be resisted.&rdquo;
