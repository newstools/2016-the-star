The Mombasa county assembly on Thursday voted that Kongowea MCA Jabez Oduor be investigated over forgery and land grabbing allegations.His case will be forwarded to the EACC if the Lands Committee finds him cupable. MCAs threatened to demonstrate if the case is not forwarded to the anti-graft agency.Oduor said he is ready to face the EACC. He said the assembly has a list containing the names of land grabbers, and he is not on the list.He said he is being attacked because he played a crucial role in identifying land grabbers in Mombasa. The lawmakers on Thursday were reacting to a scuffle on Sunday between county inspectorate officers and police over a disputed parcel in Nyali. Oduor says he is the owner.Governor Hassan Joho s former political adviser Idris Abdirahman was roughed up and arrested. A court order bars county officials from trespassing, digging andexcavting. On Thursday, all pro-county MCAs ganged up against Oduor. They compelled deputy speaker Rashid Mswaba to rule that documents for the parcel be scrutinised to determine their authenticity before the matter is forwarded to the EACC. Lands Committee chairman Suleiman Boma tabled the motion to act against Oduor. Most members said Oduor is out to tarnish the county s good .He dared lawmakers to forward a report tabled iat the assembly last year April bearing the list of land grabbers in Mombasa. Some of them, including people who they are protecting, are contained therein. This is why up to now they have refused to act on the report, he said.
