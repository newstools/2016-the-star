Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are wants the Registrar of Political Parties compelled to publish the names of all political parties that have complied with the Political Parties Act.Under a certificate of urgency, Mong&rsquo;are says the registrar has failed to publish in &ldquo;the Gazette and in one daily newspaper with a nationwide circulation&rdquo; declarations from all registered political parties as required the law.According to the court documents, the duties are provided under Section 34 of the Act. The senator fears that the country heads into electioneering, yet some parties have not complied. Through lawyer Mwambi Zachariah, Mong&rsquo;are says it is important to have the names of all political parties published so Kenyans can know the status of the parties. &ldquo;It has become apparent the registrar is either unwilling or has neglected her duty, thus her actions are of impunity and an abuse of powers of the office,&rdquo; he says.Mong&rsquo;are says his freedom of access to information continues to be violated by the registrar. The senator wants the registrar to appear in court and give reasons why penalties prescribed in the Act have not been meted out on non-complying parties.
