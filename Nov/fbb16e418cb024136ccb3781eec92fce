Devolution is working dismally and benefits are far below the expectations of wananchi, Nyandarua Senator Muriuki Karue said on Wednesday.He said Kenyans still have a lot of reservations about the system. Karue was addressing Nyandarua MCAs in Manunga Catholic Hall, Kipipiri. In my honest view, we have reached 33 per cent. We have a long way to go, he said.Karue said many factors undermine devolution and portend a bleak future if left unchecked. He said the Constitution has many areas, which are not clear on what is to be done. The vagueness adversely affects implementation, as it is exploited by self-seeking officers.Karue accused the national government of stifling devolution by trying to do the work of the county governments. The NYS scandal, he said, resulted from such tendencies. The national government has no business coming to do drainage in Nyandarua, for example. When you look at it, something is wrong, Karue said.The legislator accused national government officials of being uncommitted to the success of devolution. He said many of them would rather have the funds meant for counties retained in their offices, where they have access to it.Karue also accused constitutional commissions and the national Treasury of hindering devolution. He said governors complain about the delay in disbursing funds, but the Treasury never gives a tangible reason for delay.However, Karue also turned the heat up on county bosses, accusing them of being too haughty, to the detriment of devolution. He said their behaviour makes it difficult for the Senate to have reasonable discussions with them. They place themselves so high that sometimes they ignore everyone including you, the people, Karue said. Even the governors and the people must not be excused for this level of corruption. He said county officials are also responsible for failures of devolution. Karue cited Bungoma officials, saying they thought a Sh5,000 wheelbarrow can go for Sh105,000-109,000.
