Jubilee Party members in Nyanza should stop making demands on who should be appointed to party positions, Nominated Senator Joy Gwendo has said.She backed Raphael Tuju as the head of the JP secretariat. Gwendo spoke in Kisumu on Saturday.Last week, some JP members in Nyanza questioned why former TNA secretary General Onyango Oloo was not named in the secretariat and demanded that he be included.Gwendo said she has no problem with Oloo, but the choice of Tuju is the best for the new party.She said members should not hold party owners to ransom on who should be appointed to lead the party. As the Luo community we should be happy because Tuju has been given a high position in the party, she said.
