It was easy to forget, when former CS Anne Waiguru sat before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, to answer to some extremely humiliating accusations, that this was the woman once referred to in whispers as &ldquo;The Prime Minister&rdquo;.As was noted during the proceedings, the docket she ran as the Cabinet Secretary for Devolution and Planning, was roughly equivalent to seven independent ministries under the Grand Coalition Government of 2008 to early 2013.And yet there she was, effectively being accused of having been the mastermind of a spectacular theft of funds within her ministry. And having to answer to the kind of &ldquo;ordinary MP&rdquo; who, in her heyday, would have been kept waiting outside her office.Could there be a clearer demonstration of a fall from grace?And is not the fate of Anne Waiguru &ndash; whether she is eventually found guilty or innocent &ndash; a warning to those who might allow the power they wield to go to their heads?
