A conservancy in Laikipia has cancelled a $6 million (Sh600 million) investment due to the current farm invasions and violence.This will result in the loss of 250 jobs and potential tax revenue of $1 million over the next two years."We have suspended the investment pending proper resolution of this crisis and until the elections are completed. (We see the two as inextricably linked)," said the conservancy's CEO, who did not want the property identified. Other farms and conservancies, the largest employers in Laikipia and also the largest taxpayers, are also suspending investments due to the ongoing invasions.The latest farm to be invaded in Laikipia is Jennings, outside Rumuruti on the way to Kifuku, opposite the farm of Senator GG Kariuki.Armed herdsmen on Sunday invaded the farm of Will Jennings, a mixed race Kenyan, even though the Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) was nearby.A security meeting in Rumuruti on November 9 was chaired by Francis ole Kaparo, chairman of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, and around 400 RDU were deployed afterwards.However, this number is probably inadequate when there are thousands of armed outsiders invading Laikipia.More on this: Laikipia farm invasions continueAlso read: Laikipia clashes persist as MPs, cops, barons blamed
