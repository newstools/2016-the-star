The East Africa Legislative Assembly has condemned the increasing cases of corruption and insecurity in partner states.Members have also expressed concern over civil war in South Sudan and Burundi.Addressing a press conference at Parliament Buildings, Nairobi, EALA speaker Fred Kidega yesterday urged member states to obey the treaty on good governance, accountability, transparency and to uphold civil rights. We appeal to the elected government of South Sudan to lead the way in peace building. We will use the framework in the treaty to try and mediate for peace in the youngest African country, he said.On the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from South Sudan, Kidega was diplomatic.He said, The reason for the withdrawal of troops is beyond my sphere of understanding and the matter should be left to generals to deal with. Kidega urged all heads of state to help solve the South Sudan crisis. The EALA has developed the Whistleblowers Bill which seeks to make it easy to report corruption.Kidega raised concerns some member states are not committed to integration. He cited situations where students are still referred to as foreigners when they seek admission at neighbouring universities.On the Common Market Protocol, Kidega said some countries are apprehensive about its implementation.The Common Market Protocol provides for free movement of goods, services, labour capital and rights to establishment and settlement. We encourage partner states to fight fears and suspicion to enable the region to attain free movement and the full operationalisation of the protocol, Kidega said.
