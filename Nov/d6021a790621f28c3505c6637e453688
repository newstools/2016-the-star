Kwale county bosses Salim Mvurya and Fatuma Achani have criticised ODM leaders in the area who have accused them of corruption and poor performance.Mvurya, who is Governor, said anyone with concerns about county expenditure should follow the right channels in addressing them, and not engage in political wars.&ldquo;All projects are implemented after public participation... Locals are asking for more ECDEs. Those accusing us over such projects do not know their responsibilities and the geography of the county," he said.Regarding claims of failing to address water issues raised by speaker Sammy Ruwa, Mvurya said several projects were underway.He also refuted claims that he became a land broker after joining Jubilee Party, which has been accused of grabbing land in the coastal region.The government has repeatedly denied the claims, citing the issuance of title deeds to residents of counties including Kwale and Taita Taveta.Read: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODMAlso read: I am ready to take over from ODM rebel Mvurya, says Kwale Deputy GovernorAchani, who is Deputy Governor, described Senator Juma Boy as a failure undeserving of his position.She said it was unfortunate that he went round claiming Sh16 billion of funds given by the national government since 2013 has not been used and yet he raised the issue with the Senate.&ldquo;The senate has not questioned Mvurya about Boy's allegations that the amount is missing, or on how it has been used. That means Boy has failed Kwale people,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;He should have been the first person to raise the issue with the Senate for Mvurya to be grilled but that has not happened."Achani further told the Star by phone on Sunday that Boy should raise the matter of funds misuse on the proper platform, not through political rallies, which hardly lead to solutions."If the Senator does not know we have wards, which are different in terms of needs, and that jobs are distributed using such criteria, then we have the wrong person in the Senate,&rdquo; she added.The Deputy Governor also dismissed the land grabbing allegations against Jubilee, saying individuals, not the party, were committing the crime.&ldquo;Instead of giving the people solutions, he is asking them questions because he has not done anything after being elected, meaning he has failed,&rdquo; she reiterated.Boy, Ruwa and Kwale governor aspirant Gereza Dena claimed Mvurya's administration was corrupt and that he had failed to address key issues after joining JP. failed to address water issues as well as turning to be a land broker after joining Jubilee party.Speaker Ruwa claimed that Mvurya has continued building ECDEs and issuing unhelpful bursary equivalent to those issued by CDF in the area.Senator Boy claimed Mvurya has not done anything with Sg16 billion &lsquo;he has brought to the county&rsquo; since 2013 in terms of jobs and development projects in the ward level.Read: Kwale assembly on the spot over Sh34.9 million foreign trips
