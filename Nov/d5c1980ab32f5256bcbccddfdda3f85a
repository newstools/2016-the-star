ICT CS Joe Mucheru has torn into Nation Media Group over its reportage of the Sh5.3 billion HealthGate affair, saying a company it owns received Sh2.3 million.Mucheru, in a complaint letter to Media Council of Kenya, said the leaked 'internal audit report' that the media house used for its expose mentioned the company known as Gazeti Limited.He said Nation purposely failed to quote the company in the expose carried by the Business Daily. If Business Daily, and by extension NMG, believes the payment made to Gazeti Limited, which was also listed in the report, was proper and done within the course of doing regular business, why would they accuse everyone else listed in the same report as having engaged in theft or fraud? he asked.Mucheru further said it was wrong for the newspaper to carry the story based on a leaked interim audit report. Interim audits are documents that raise queries for management to respond to or clarify and its only a final report that can be quoted for reference purposes, he stated.The Cabinet Secretary lodged a formal complaint against Nation Media Group for allegedly publishing defamatory content.Mucheru asked the Media Council to play its role and push the media house to provide materials proving Health ministry officials stole the amount.He said in a letter addressed to Council chairman Charles Kerich that he wants NMG to apologise for alleging health officials were linked to the theft. We call on MCK to play its role as arbiter and regulator and compel Nation media outlets Business Daily and NTV to provide proof of theft by government officers as contained in their newspaper report," he said.The CS said the news story carried by Business Daily was slanderous and contrary to media ethics.He added that NTV carried the same story a day later but with more graphics, labeling government officers as 'Majambazi (thugs)'. Business Daily and NTV must be compelled to show where, in the interim report, it is stated that Health ministry officials stole more than Sh5.3 billion... We hope they will table any proof they have," he said.Kerich said the letter will be forwarded to the newly formed Media Council complaints committee.Read: Muraguri apologises for threatening journalist after Sh5bn exposeAlso read: Only 20 Kenyans turn up for Health scam protestLast Friday, Health PS Nicholas Muraguri apologised for threatening the Business Daily journalist who reported the alleged theft.The newspaper had reported that Sh5 billion was allegedly stolen by the ministry's officials through manipulation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System.Business Daily claimed Muraguri came to the ministry's defence saying the government can get into newsrooms systems and see what they write before it is published."Someone can be reading your story while seated here.
