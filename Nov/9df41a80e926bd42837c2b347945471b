The number of mobile money agents have more than doubled to 22,000 this month from 10,000 in May, Airtel has said. Chief executive Adil El Youssefi has attributed the increase to 25 distribution partnerships it has signed countrywide, following a massive recruitment campaign in April. The second largest mobile network operator said it picked the 25 distributors from 80 it shortlisted from 140 applicants. This strategy helped Airtel to localise agent acquisition and expand faster in regions outside Nairobi, Youssefi said. The firm has simplified the process of on boarding new agents from two weeks to one hour to attract more agents. It hopes to eat into the market share dominated by Safaricom s M-Pesa, which controlled 24.8 million customers in September.
