Migori County Contractors&rsquo; Association has filed a petition to compel the county government to pay them all their dues for the last three financial years.The association wants the county stopped from launching any other project until members are paid. Chairman Sam Otieno and secretary general Godness Oucho sent the petition to the county assembly, Senate Public Accounts Committee and Migori secretary Christopher Rusana.Speaking to the press in Migori town on Monday, the officials said the local assembly, led by Clerk Tom Opere, is yet to respond to the petition dated October 28&ldquo;We request the assembly to take the petition seriously to help us get paid before the due date,&rdquo; Oucho said.&ldquo;We have constantly been told all contracts have been paid by the county government, yet our members still seek payment for completed projects. Some have fallen into depression over the stalemate.&rdquo; Some members complained of piecemeal payments. They want clear communication between the association and accounting office.&ldquo;Accounting officers from each department should be empowered to deal with contractors directly, instead of having one person pay us,&rdquo; Oucho said.Migori Governor aspirant Anne Omodho Anyanga yesterday urged the county to pay contractors, as money had been allocated for them.&ldquo;The projects were budgeted for and the money allocated. If the funds were diverted to personal projects, we demand payment be made before any further project is undertaken,&rdquo; she said.Last month, 12 MCAs, led by South Sakwa&rsquo;s Jared Osawa and North Kamagambo&rsquo;s Richard Solo, called on the executive to clear debts owed to suppliers and contractors. They said most suppliers wallow in poverty, yet their money is withheld.
