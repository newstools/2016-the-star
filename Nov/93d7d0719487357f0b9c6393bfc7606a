Coach terms Sofapaka&rsquo;s SPL survival &lsquo;a miracle&rsquo;Legendary Sofapaka player turned coach John Baraza who steed his team to survival by the skin of their teeth has termed that feat a miracle.Baraza oversaw Sofapaka&rsquo;s last day dramatic escape with an 5-1 demolition of Thika United at the expense of Ushuru. Baraza speaking on the KPL official portal said that while he was praying and hoping for a favourable turn of events, he had on many occasions considered his team&rsquo;s survival as being unattainable.&ldquo;Okay, I wanted so much for us to survive, but I couldn&rsquo;t be very sure because it depended on so many factors. Matters were not in our hands. First we had to win the game, and then we needed Ushuru to lose otherwise our efforts would have been in vain.That was a lot of pressure and I just didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. I just focused on that last game and when I found out that we had actually survived I was very happy,&rdquo; said the retired goal poacher and the clubs all time leading scorer.&ldquo;I am yet to get over the excitement. In fact, I can&rsquo;t explain how we did it but we managed to survive and that is very exciting. This was a miracle,&rdquo; the Batoto ba Mungu coach said.Sofapaka had limped all season in their worst performance since joining the top flight in 2009.They occupied the bottom section of the league table throughout the season, only to pull clear above the relegation zone on the final match day, thanks to their 5-1 thumping of Thika.Their downward trend was attributed mainly to the absence of chairman Elly Kalekwa, who returned to the club in June after a one year hiatus.In his absence, Sofapaka plunged into deep financial problems which saw key players making an exit together with the club&rsquo;s Ugandan coach Sam Timbe.In the last four matches of the league however, Sofapaka, the 2009 Kenyan champions, showed character, drawing once with fancied Mathare United before collecting maximum points against Muhoroni Youth, AFC Leopards and Thika.All this time Ushuru were inexplicably dropping points freely, drawing against Muhoroni Youth and Nairobi City Stars and losing to Thika United.Going into the final day of competition, Ushuru needed just a draw to survive relegation at the expense of Sofapaka, but it was not to be.
