Kenya is monitoring the withdrawal from the ICC with keen interest, Political and Diplomatic secretary Tom Amolo has told the UN General Assembly yesterday.Last month, Burundi, Gambia and South Africa kicked off their withdrawal from the court by taking various actions leading to the one-year process. Senegal, Nigeria and Tanzania support the court.Kenya is still concerned that the court is not accommodating Africa s views, even as the UN General Assembly pledged support for the ICC, Amolo said.However, many states called for talks to address the concerns raised by African countries, with Amolo asking the court to unshackle itself from the influence of a group of powerful member states. Something is deeply wrong at the International Criminal Court. With only one new accession during the reporting period, it is clear that this court only continues to enjoy membership and support from a small segment of countries in the world, he said. The ICC s dismal output of tangible results is disheartening and simply confounding. Kenya rallied the African Union to a mass withdrawal from the court just before the cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto collapsed. The government is now under pressure to actualise this threat despite having decided to take the reform route.
