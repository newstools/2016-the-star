The hue and cry raised by Mumias residents and leaders in the face of the police reaction to the theft of seven assault rifles and 180 bullets from a police post should attract more attention than it is getting.On Wednesday at 4am, thugs invaded the Booker police post, within the Mumias Sugar Factory, attacking the lone officer on duty before breaking into the armoury, where they stole the G3 rifles and ammunition.As poor planning goes, leaving a solitary cop guarding an armoury is criminally negligent.What has followed is equally slow-witted and counterproductive: The hunt for the guns and the ammo has resulted in two deaths and many injuries. Instead of using DCI intelligence and the informer network, there is random collective punishment of motorists and motorcyclists on the Mumias-Bungoma road.The massacre in Kasese, only five hours away inside Uganda, has Kenyans maximum attention. But we need to focus on the incipient atrocity in Mumias too.
