Three Indian investors have applied to set up tanning factories at the at the proposed Leather Industrial Park in Machakos County, the Ministry of Industrialisation has said. Principal secretary Julius Korir described this is as a major win for the government which has spent the better part of this year scouting for investors to occupy the 500 acres of land that was hived in Kinanie, Athi River. Investor roadshows have mainly focused on the US, India, China, Malaysia, Dubai, Singapore and Europe. “We now have 11 eleven applications in total since nine local investors had applied in August,” he said on Friday during a trade and investment meeting with the Indian investors in Nairobi. The plan by the government is to establish a competitive leather sector that can compete with Ethiopia. The park alone is expected to create an additional 35,000 jobs. The park will be funded fully by the private sector at an estimated cost of Sh17 billion with government providing land and necessary infrastructure. However, its not yet clear how much investment the 11 investors have pledged to put in. Korir said the groundbreaking for infrastructure development will happen in December. This will pave way for the construction of a global standard waste treatment plant and an integrated leather and byproducts production facilities. Tanneries will then be put up, each with a daily production capacity of 10 tonnes of hides and skins and 10,000 pairs of shoes, handbags, leather garments and industrial gloves. The park will also house a training centre, chemical storage and distribution units and business centres. “The park will play a huge role in increasing competitiveness and modernisation of the leather industry,” the PS said.
