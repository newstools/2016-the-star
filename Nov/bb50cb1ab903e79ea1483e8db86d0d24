One positive element in the IEBC's preparations for the next general election is the detailed workplan it made public a year ago. If it is implemented it will ensure a smooth poll in 2017.The workplan identifies every step to be taken, with a timeframe for each activity.It is now time for procurement of ballot papers and, as is usual in Kenya, the losers of the printing tender have rushed to demand that the process be halted.ODM also questioned the award of the Sh2.5 billion tender to the Dubai-based Al Ghurair printing firm, insisting the procurement be done only after voter registration.Election-related contracts are time-bound and any delay could jeopardise the planning and conduct of the polls.If there is evidence the Dubai company was involved in wrongdoing, the tender should be reviewed. But if Al Ghurair won fair and square, gave the best price for the best quality, there is no need to delay the process.
