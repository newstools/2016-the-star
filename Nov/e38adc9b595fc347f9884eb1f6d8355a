Many politicians were caught flat foot when Kihika, who is seen as inexperienced in politics, was bestowed with the humongous task in the vast Rift Valley region on Friday.Kihika was named among other Jubilee campaign leaders across the country during the party's national governing council meeting at Bomas of Kenya.Read: UhuRuto name 16 interim Jubilee Party officialsAlso read: Raphael Tuju named Jubilee Party Secretariat boss It came as a surprise to Nakuru's political heavyweights such as Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri who were expected to be appointed to the campaign team. However, several MPs and MCA's welcomed Kihika's appointment and pledged to support her ahead of 2017 general election.David Gikaria (Nakuru Town East), Jacob Macharia (Molo), Nelson Ngaichuhie (Subukia), Samwel Arama (Nakuru Town West), Joseph Kiuna (Njoro) Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati) and Samuel Ndiritu (Gilgil) supported the appointment.The MPs said in Nakuru on Saturday that they were ready to work with the county speaker to deliver votes for the Jubilee Party.Ngunjiri, a political nemesis of Kihika, commended President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto for the team selected to spearhead the vote hunt.Analysts say that the decision will permanently solve the disquiet at the county level as politicians position themselves for the 2017 poll.Last month, chaos erupted at a meeting convened by a Naivasha politician James Karimi at the defunct TNA offices in Nakuru.Karimi was accused of organising the meeting to impose a county Jubilee Party chairperson."She has a perfect opportunity to unite all the leaders in the county under Jubilee ," Noor said.On her part, Kihika said she was excited about her new responsibility.She said that her first assignment, as the president's campaigner in the region, is to unite all the leaders under Jubilee Party."I am determined to ensure that the presidential campaign in the region runs smoothly and everyone is on board," Kihika told the Star, adding that she is equal to the task.Some analysts say that Kihika's appointment will secure her an automatic Jubilee ticket in the Nakuru senator seat primaries.
