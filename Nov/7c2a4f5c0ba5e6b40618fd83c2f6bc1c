The Kerio Valley Development Authority will go ahead with its Sh50 billion dam projects in Elgeyo Marakwet, despite opposition from a group of residents. KVDA will implement three projects — the Arror Hydroelectric Power Plant, Kimwarer and Embobut dams. Residents have expressed concerns about being displaced without compensation. CEO David Kimosop on Thursday said displaced families will be compensated. “We urge the community to support us because we can not implement projects that we know are harmful to our people,” he said. The projects will generate 125MW of electricity, irrigate 20,000 acres and supply water to more than 80,000 households. Residents held protests on Wednesday saying they were not involved. Kimosop said all concerns, including the environmental impact, have been addressed. Water PS Fred Segor said the projects were approved procedurally and will not destroy the environment. He said the Sh36 billion Itare Dam Water Supply project in Nakuru will proceed as planned, despite calls by opposition chief Raila Odinga for it to be stopped. Raila says the project would cause water shortage in Bomet, Nyamira and Kisumu counties.
