Cotu has castigated MPs from sugar growing areas for failing to push for a state ban on sugar importation.Deputy secretary general Benson Okwaro said resulting trade imbalances have adversely affected trade in sugar milled locally.Okwaro accused the MPs whom he did not name of remaining silent instead of saving the gailing Mumias Sugar Company.He said the group has concentrated its energies on non-issues "yet the collapse of Mumias Sugar will severely impoverish" Western residents."The influx of imported sugar is affecting the sale of local sugar leading to losses for companies," he said in a statement on Tuesday."Unless the government comes out forcefully to stop illegal sugar imports from flooding our local market, the collapse of the sugar industry, which is imminent, will result in massive job losses in the sector."Okwaro accused government officials of protecting sugar barons responsible for the troubles in the sector."Cotu challenges these MPs to petition the Jubilee government to save Mumias and other sugar firms from further losses," he said.He added that the legislators must rein in cartels operating within the Jubilee government.Mumias Sugar on Monday reported a net loss of Sh4.73 billion for the year ended June. This was attributed to an acute shortage of quality cane", particularly in the fourth quarter."This is an increase from a loss of Sh4.64 billion posted in 2015," the company said in its audited financial statement.Following the loss, the firm's directors did not recommend payment of dividends.But the miller reported that revenues grew by 13.6 per cent to Sh6.28 billion from Sh5.53 billion in 2015.Read: Mumias records Sh4.7 billion loss as Kenya s sugar production dropsThe company has been implementing a turnaround strategy, which includes debt restructuring, following the Sh2.1 billion bailout by the government.
