ODM leader Raila Odinga has come under fire over his appeal to MPs to overturn President Uhuru Kenyatta's memorandum on Petroleum Bill.Jubilee MPs led by Johnson Sakaja said Raila had not credibility when it came to the discussion of oil and petroleum matters in Kenyan.Sakaja said Raila's criticisms are a combination of interests he has in his oil and petroleum businesses, which he intends to keep safe ahead of the 2017 general elections.More on this: Raila opens his wallet and starts 2017 spendingThey said Kenyans should remember that Raila was closely associated with a firm called Triton International, which unlawfully acquired large quantitied of petroleum and then sold them, which cost the country Sh7.6 billion."That is why we are unable to take seriously his criticisms of the proposed amendments to the Petroleum Bill," they MPs said.They said to this day the Triton scandal has been unresolved and Raila was a person of interest in it."Kenyans will also recall that during his tenure as Energy minister, Raila apparently acquired a number of unusual business suspects," Tetu MP Ndung'u Githinji said."It has been reliably reported that a firm by the name Energem is a shareholder in Raila's Spectre International, and that some of the directors of Energem are directly connected to an investor accused of acquiring a substantial proportion of Guinea's mineral resources by corrupt means," Githinji added.Githinji said Raila's associations "look like an attempt to steal a country's mineral resources", adding "it is unclear why anyone would believe Raila's claims about Africa or Kenya's mineral wealth".Githiji and Sakaja were accompanied by nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi, Nairobi woman rep Rachel Shebesh and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire.Read: I am not involved in KQ cargo collapse - RailaAlso read: Raila, tell us more about Kisumu molasses plant
