Rescue operations at the collapsed building in Kisii town have been halted for a while as rescuers wait KDF to bring special equipment from Nairobi to access the lower floors. Deputy director National Disaster Management Unit Pius Masai said on Friday that the special vehicle has left Nairobi, which is about 300km away. Six bodies have so far been retrieved, while eight people are believed to be trapped in the rubble of the 10-storey building. Twenty-six survivors are admitted to the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, two are in critical condition. "We know there are several others still trapped inside. We need them to be safely rescued," a resident said. The building was last year condemned by the National Construction Authority. Reports indicate the approved plan was for a three-storey building, but the developer went ahead and added seven more floors. NCA South Nyanza regional coordinator Lucas Adwera said it will prepare a report which will be presented to the press soon. One of the survivors, Lilian Akinyi, said she felt the building shake and scampered for safety. She said many of her workmates on the second floor are still trapped. “I fear for the lives of my colleagues. I survived because I was on the ground floor,” Akinyi said. Another surviver Robert Omwenga said, “Some floors sank before it collapsed. Some of the people injured were on the road.” David Ombogo said his sister Kerubo, who owned a shop in the building, was among those trapped in the rubble. “I was informed Kerubo is still trapped inside. I have tried to call her but she is not answering my calls,” he said. More on this read: 6 dead, 34 injured after condemned 10-storey Kisii building collapses
