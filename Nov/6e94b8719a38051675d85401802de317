A pesticide that is used heavily on GM crops has been found in foods sold in the US including cereals and snacks.Products such as Cheerios, Kellogg&rsquo;s Corn Flakes, Doritos crisps and Ritz crackers were found to have traces of glyphosate &ndash; identified by the World Health Organisation as a &lsquo;probable human carcinogen&rsquo;.Glyphosate is the weedkiller used most heavily on commercially grown GM crops.GM corn and soya have been genetically modified to withstand spraying with glyphosate, so they can be doused with the chemical without being damaged &ndash; meaning it is more likely to be found in the resulting food.The findings were uncovered by GM critics at the campaigning groups Food Democracy Now and The Detox Project.Dave Murphy, of Food Democracy Now, said that their findings were "alarming".Kellogg&rsquo;s said breakfast cereals sold in Britain were made here. The firm said it has found no evidence of glyphosate residue in the grains it uses. Cheerios, Doritos and Ritz sold in the UK are not imported from the US.
