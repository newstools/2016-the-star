The High Court has prohibited Nairobi governor aspirant Miguna Miguna from making any further defamatory statements against rival Esther Passaris. Justice Joseph Sergon said Miguna shall not defame Passaris by word or through her images on various media platforms, including social, print and electronic media.Passaris filed an application in court, claiming Miguna maliciously and without any lawful or legal cause published on Twitter defamatory words . the tweet read, Kenyans in their millions should watch @KoinangeJeff Live on KTN on November 16 at 10PM as I expose thieves and drug dealers. Next to these words was a picture of Miguna and below it the words VS THE CARTELS. Passaris says next to the words THE CARTELS were images of some of the people who have expressed their interest in the Nairobi governor seat, including her.Passaris argues that the contents of Miguna s tweets were defamatory and were actuated by malice. She says in addition, they have caused her and her family much distress as she was depicted as a scoundrel, a member of a cartel, a thief, a looter and a drug pusher.Passaris said this is contrary to the reputation she has worked hard to cultivate over a long period of time. She said she is a caring mother, a hardworking entrepreneur and an aspirant for Nairobi governor.
