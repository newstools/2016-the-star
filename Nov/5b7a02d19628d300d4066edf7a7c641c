Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero on Wednesday condemned the impunity of matatus plying the Rongai route, saying they are to blame for lawlessness. He was speaking when he met officials of eight saccos from Rongai at the Park Place Hotel. Rongai matatus are the most indisciplined vehicles in the country.They are driven with impunity, don t respect traffic rules and above all, they destroy Kidero grass, the governor said. He said the behaviour has made him consider banning the matatus from the CBD. He said they could reach Bangladesh Bridge , then another vehicle takes passengers to town.
