A Muslim lobby group wants thorough investigations into the circumstances under which a man was shot dead outside the US Embassy in Nairobi last Thursday.The Kenya Muslim Caucus said there are compelling reasons to believe that 24-year old Abdimahat Ibrahim was a victim of a trigger-happy GSU officer. Although the man was quickly labeled a member of al Shabaab or ISIS, we have reason to believe there could be more than meets the eye, said group chairman Issa Ahmed.He said available information, including statements from family members and photographs from the scene, strongly suggest the officer may have been too quick to kill Ibrahim.In a press statement on Wednesday, Ahmed called on the embassy to release CCTV footage of the incident. He said this will help explain what happened before the shooting. Without doing so, it would be difficult not to conclude that there was a possible cover-up in the killing, he said. We call on Kenyan and US authorities to expedite independent investigations into the matter and release findings as soon as possible."Reports indicated Ibrahim went to the embassy armed with a knife and was shot twice by a GSU officer he had stabbed in the head and chest.Gigiri OCPD Vitalis Otieno said the man had grabbed the officer manning the entrance gate to the visa section.Otieno said a confrontation resulted, during which the man took out a knife he had hidden in his trousers and attacked the policeman.More on this: [VIDEO] Man shot dead outside US embassy in NairobiPolice said investigations were launched to establish the motive for the attack.

We demand independent investigations into the unfortunate incident in order to conclusively put the matter to rest, he said. This issue remains a thorn in the flesh of many Kenyans and is creating unnecessary resentment and distrust of the government."He condemned acts of terrorism but asked the government to avoid extrajudicial measures in combating it.
