They demonstrated and sent home IEBC chair Issack Hassan," Duale said."Jubilee is not worried even if the IEBC chair is his brother Oburu Oginga. We will win with 70 per cent plus," he said.He said that Jubilee has fulfilled most of the promises it made to Kenyans on health, water, security and roads.Duale further told off the Cord management team over IEBC remarks saying they cannot manage the poll body."IEBC, under article 249 (2) (b) is an independent institution that cannot be directed by anyone, party, individual or institutions," the Garissa Township MP said.He added that the constitution is very clear on who is supposed to serve as IEBC chair, commissioners and at the secretariat."The outgoing commissioners will leave once new team is sworn in," he said.Duale added that the 2017 general election will be between those who believe in development and those who believe in disunity, chaos, demonstrations and incitement.Governor Salim Mvurya said that Kwale people have completely joined Jubilee and promised to unite them.Kwale woman representative Zainab Chizuga, Kinango MP Gonzi Rai and LungaLunga MP Khatib Mwashetani reaffirmed their support for Jubilee.Also read: The hidden hand behind Nasa and why it will never launch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
