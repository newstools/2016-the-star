Five suspected M-Pesa fraudsters were arrested in Maralal town, Samburu, on Saturday morning after police officers raided a bar they were in.The four men and one woman were arrested by CID officers after failing in their attempt to escape using a Toyota Axion registration number KCG 429N.Samburu county police commander Francis Kumut told reporters they had been conning M-Pesa operators for two months. He said they were alerted by the operators."We are the ones who led police officers to 3D Lounge where we found them having fun. I jumped on one of them when he tried to escape," said businessman Vileta Khaleed.Kumut said police believed the five were part of a syndicate from Nakuru, whose members pretend to be Safaricom customer care agents."They have stolen from more than 15 M-Pesa shops in Maralal. Yesterday they robbed an agent of Sh 52,000," he said, adding more than Sh500,000 had been lost."They pretend to have made deposits to wrong numbers and then make calls to friends posing as customer care agents."He said they were taken to Maralal police station and will be charged once police complete investigations.Some M-Pesa operators claimed an Administration Police officer showed the gang around."An AP officer has been driving that vehicle. He has even been bringing them to our shops. We are calling upon police to investigate him," said Elizabeth Wanjiru.Kumut denied the claim that an officer based at the Maralal station helped the gang but said investigations will reveal the truth.He said agents who have been victims of the gang's tricks recorded statements and that police were pursuing its leader, who is believed to receive all the money.More than 20 operators camped at the station threatening to lynch the suspects"If police release them to us, we can teach them a lesson," said Aisha Akiru who lost Sh70,000.The operators asked telecommunications company Safaricom to train agents on security measures and money laundering to prevent theft.
