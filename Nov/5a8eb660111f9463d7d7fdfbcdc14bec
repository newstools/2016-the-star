The IEBC has pushed to next week the deadline for suppliers to bid for multi-million tenders for the supply of election materials.Bids for materials, including unbreakable and fire-resistant ballot boxes, were to be submitted by Wednesday morning, as indicated in an earlier advertisement.The electoral body said in a notice on Tuesday that the new deadline is November 17 at 11am.Among the materials the IEBC is seeking to buy are 106,000 transparent ballot boxes for additional polling stations and to replace faulty and broken ones.In specifications for the ballot boxes, the commission said they "shall not show any splitting, permanent distortion or other signs of failure".The boxes should also be manufactured from suitable plastic material that withstands exposure to ultra-violet radiations.They should further be fire-resistant and not trap ballot papers when being emptied.The body of the ballot boxes shall be smooth with no sharp edges and free from flashes, the IEBC said in tender documents.Other electoral materials for which bids have been invited include security seals, tamper proof envelopes marked 'IEBC Confidential Material' and indelible marker pens.Others are rubber stamps, branded notebooks, election forms, lamps, reflective jackets, hacksaw blades and sisal twines.The IEBC has laid out an elaborate strategy for the 2017 polls; its 2016-2022 Strategic Plan lays emphasis on early preparations. These include deployment and testing of new technology long before the general election, accurate voter registers, intensive training of poll officials and prior testing of the results transmission system. During the last election, the commission was unable to deal with technical hitches that hit it on Election Day. On many occasions, electronic devices deployed in the field malfunctioned, or IEBC staff had no idea how to use them.
