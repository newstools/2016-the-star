Flooding in Nairobi is nowadays a given when heavy downpour is experienced accompanied with long hours of traffic snarl ups.Earlier in the year during the heavy rains and floods saw motorists abandon their submerged vehicles.The floods were largely attributed to poor drainage infrastructure, as daily litter from motorists and pedestrians clogged the system.Steven Omolo, an entrepreneur, observed that motorists in traffic opted to throw litter from their vehicles, as opposed to disposing it in the appropriate place, which worsened the situation.[VIDEO] Nairobi flooded, cars swept by raging watersFrom that, Omolo thought of a solution: coming up with car waste bags.The bags are made of a little bit of fabric and more of rexine leather on the inside to ensure there is no leakage.In regards to durability, the waste bags can be used up to three years and in the event of a tear it can be recycled.Omolo says the uptake of the bags have been very encouraging, with the ones for personal vehicles going for Sh500 while the bigger ones, for public service vehicles going for Sh800 each.A sample of the car waste bag designed by Steven Omolo for personal vehicles. /VICTOR IMBOTO&quot;I initially started the initiative as a hobby making the bags for my friends and colleagues. With time I decided to direct the venture towards the business direction as corporate companies became interested,&quot; he says.Corporate companies also have the option of branding the bags with their logos, while public service vehicles can use theirs in a similar way to advertise for others.Steven Omolo with a sample of a car waste bag for use in a public service vehicle. /VICTOR IMBOTOIn raising awareness, Omolo says the venture seeks to curb the negative tendency among Kenyans to litter.He said that he&#39;s trying to go through agencies such as the National Environment Management Authority and National Transport and Safety Authority to garner support.Omolo, CEO of Shanels Group of Companies Limited, said the previous trash bins used in PSVs were not sustainable.A sample of the car waste bags designed by Steven Omolo. /COURTESYHe says they tend to start smelling, which makes them unbearable to use for long periods of time.He says with the car waste bags, everything is contained inside therefore eradicating the issue of stench.After arriving home one can dispose the trash in the appropriate place and just clean it using water.A sample of the car waste bags designed by Steven Omolo. /COURTESYThe main challenge is having people seeing the value of a new concept and embracing it.
