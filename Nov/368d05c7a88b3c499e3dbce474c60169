Catalyst Principal Partners has sold its controlling stake in Goodlife Pharmacy barely a month after acquiring a major stake Tanzania's leading pharmaceutical Zenufa Laboratories.The East African-focused private equity said it has sold off its stake in Kenya's leading retail drug store to Mauritius-headquartered LeapFrog Investments, a private equity, for Sh2.2 billion. This is arguably the largest direct investment deal in the pharmaceutical industry in the five-nation East African-community market.Catalyst, along with strategic partners Africa Chemist and Beauty Care of Mauritius, acquired a controlling stake in Goodlife then known as Mimosa Pharmacy in September 2014.In barely three years, Goodlife has grown to be the largest pharmaceutical retail chain across Eastern Africa consolidating health, personal care and beauty care in its products and service offering. The pharmaceutical retailer grew its footprint from six stores primarily located in Nairobi and Mombasa, to 19 convenient locations that extend into emerging urban centres in Kenya and Uganda. Catalyst invested in a well-positioned local pharmacy chain that was benefiting from the rapidly growing healthcare, retail and consumer sectors, Catalyst managing director Biniam Yohannes said yesterday in a press briefing.LeapFrog's global co-lead for Asia and Africa Michael Fernandes said they want to upgrade Goodlife from a pharmacy to a place where consumers can access clinicians through telemedicine. This is a model that markets like East Africa are ripe for, particularly as we see a dramatic increase in chronic lifestyle diseases, he said.In 2015, Goodlife Pharmacy received financing from the International Finance Corporation to accelerate its expansion plans. IFC s head of health and education practice Biju Mohandas said: "IFC has been part of Goodlife s growth story alongside Catalyst, and looks forward to working closely with the new investor, management and other shareholders in their continuing endeavor to provide good quality, affordable pharmaceutical products to the East African consumer."LeapFrog, a leading specialist investor in emerging markets, says the diversification of its investments into pharmaceuticals will help to build a platform that combines both payers and providers, to improve access to affordable and quality healthcare.It says its approach is aimed at partnering with companies in Asia and Africa that are addressing the healthcare challenge.LeapFrog also has an investment of Sh18.7 billion in health insurer Resolution Insurance that was executed in 2014.
