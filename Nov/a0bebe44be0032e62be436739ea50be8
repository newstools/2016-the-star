Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka (pictured) wants the Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission to lease the Biometric Voter Registration machines instead of buying.Kalonzo said this will be much cheaper. &ldquo;We can make elections very cheap if we lease these machines instead of engaging in the long process of procurement,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo said leasing will give Kenyans hope for a free and fair election because &ldquo;rigging has always started during the procurement of the registration machines.&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that the IEBC understands Kenyans are not ready to take another stolen election anymore,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo spoke during a meet-the-people tour in Machakos and Makueni counties yesterday.He made stopovers at Malili, Salama, Sultan Amud, Emali, Makindu and Kambu. Kalonzo was accompanied by Kajiondo Governor David Nkedianye, Makueni Senetor Mutula Kilonzo Junior and several MPs.Kalonzo said he is prepared to crisscross the country to woo supporters for his presidential bid.&ldquo;This time round we are not backing down. We are not going to allow anyone to play around with the destiny of this country anymore,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo said he will prove to Cord co-principals that he is the best suited to be the coalition&rsquo;s flagbearer.&ldquo;I will have no problem with my brothers Raila and Wetang&rsquo;ula if any of them proves to me that they are the best suited to face Uhuru, but as for now, every Kenyan understands that I am the best man to send Jubilee home,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo warned leaders to avoid divisive politics by taking hard line party positions.In apparent response to Senator Johnson Muthama, who had said Wiper will not tolerate the Muungano Party led by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, Kalonzo said the only enemy in Ukambani should be Jubilee Party.&ldquo;You cannot compare Muungano Party of Kivutha with Maendeleo Chap Chap of Governor Mutua because unlike Chap Chap, Muungano is not affiliated to Jubilee. Let&rsquo;s not continue to create more division locally because our enemy number one should be Jubilee,&rdquo;he said.Wiper national chairman David Musila assured all the hopefuls the party will ensure free and fair nominations.
