Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to reconsider his decision to withdraw Kenyan troops deployed in South Sudan.Abe said Kenya's presence and participation in UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) was critical to the long term peace process in the region.He spoke when he held bilateral talks with Kenyan delegation in Japan led by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday.Muturi was accompanied by Majority Leader Aden Duale, Defence and Foreign Affairs committee chairman Ndungu Gethenji, MPs Cecily Mbarire (Runyenjes) and Rachel Ameso (Kakamega).Japan has sent a Special Advisor to UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon over the sacking of Lt Gen Johnson Ondieki of South Sudan.Ban sacked Ondieki as head of UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan on grounds that he was not happy with how UNMISS handled an attack on aid workers in Juba.It is still unclear if this was the only reason for Ondieki's sacking. Kenya ordered an immediate withdrawal of its troops deployed in South Sudan after general was dismissed.Read: Ban Ki Moon sacks Kenyan Lt-General as head of UN mission in South SudanJapan sits in the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member, but it is not clear whether Ban communicated to the UN body before the decision was reached.Muturi reiterated that sacking Ondieki without due process was a violation of international norms and practices. He urged Ban to ensure UN follows the norms that it preaches, and that he would convey Abe's request to President Uhuru Kenyatta.Speaker Muturi thanked Japan for giving Kenya the opportunity to host the TICAD VI conference in August. The meeting was held at KICC. Last week, Uhuru said Kenya&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from UNMISS was a protest against the violation of the dignity of Kenya&rsquo;s soldiers.Read: Furious Kenya pulls troops from South SudanThe President said the United Nations acted in an undignified manner when it replaced the Kenyan officer who was heading the peacekeeping mission in South Sudan.
