The electoral commission has objected to a case presented by a company demanding the review of the Sh2.5 billion ballot papers tender to a Dubai-based firm.IEBC wants the firm South African based Paarl Media to deposit Sh20 million before the hearing begins today.The Public Procurement Disposal Act says, An applicant seeking review of a tender award should provide, together with his request for review, a refundable deposit as may be prescribed in the regulations and such deposit shall not be less than 10 per cent of the cost of the contract. The provision is meant to discourage the filing of frivolous applications before the board, especially where the sole intention is to delay or scuttle the procurement process.Paarl moved to the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board seeking review of the award to Al Ghurair printing company.In response to the application, the IEBC said the company had violated the Public Procurement and Disposal Act after it failed to raise its concern within 14 days as stipulated by the law. The applicant s request was filed on November 7 and is therefore time barred by effect of Section 167 of the Public Procurement Administrative Act, having filed it 18 days out of time, the agency says.IEBC said the application by the aggrieved should comply with the law regarding filing of procurement reviews.Failure by the applicant to comply, including depositing some money, renders the application null and void.The electoral agency says it adhered to high standards of procurement of the highly sensitive ballot papers by involving the Kenya Bureau of Standards in development of the specifications. The procuring entity did not issue any amendment modifying the bid document and could not therefore extend the closing date, the commission says.Last week, ODM demanded that the tender be cancelled to await the new commissioners to take office before procurement begins.CEO Ezra Chiloba said stopping the process would lead to problems similar to those experienced in the 2013 poll.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale told the Star yesterday that ODM s concerns over the tender should have been raised earlier. In June, Cord was busy pushing for the removal of IEBC commissioners. Why has it taken them this long to protest the tendering process? he said.
