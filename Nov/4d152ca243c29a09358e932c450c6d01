The Makueni county assembly has unanimously passed a bill that would devolve funds to the wards. According to the County Equitable Development Bill, 60 per cent of funds set aside for development will be shared equally among the wards.It was sponsored by Kasikeu MCA Paul Malinda. The bill proposes the establishment of Ward Project Development Committees to manage the devolved cash. It ensures residents have a say on projects, Malinda said on Thursday last week during debate.
