Zain, Kuwait's No.1 telecom operator by subscribers, on Thursday said it will pay $129 million to Bharti Airtel over a settlement related to the sale of Zain's Africa operations to the Indian firm in 2010.The payment will have no future financial impact on Zain as it set aside provisions to cover potential payments related to the transaction at the time of the sale, said a spokesman for Zain.Zain operates in eight countries in the Middle East and Africa.The company completed the $9 billion sale of its Africa business, including operations across 15 countries, in 2010. Zain still operates in South Sudan and Sudan, according to its website.Thursday's statement did not disclose what the settlement related to. In the company's third-quarter financial statement, Zain said it was liable for "taxation claims and amounts that may be due for unprovided litigation claims" after the sale of Zain Africa.The company last month reported a better then expected 12 per cent rise in third-quarter results.
