Has Kiambu County Doubled its Revenue to Sh4.7 billion?Or is this just an exaggeration as local leaders claim?Several articles, including this one published in the Star have reported claims made by the Kiambu Governor, William Kabogo, that the county has increased it&rsquo;s revenue collection to Sh4.7 billion.This increase, he further claims, has been due to the county&rsquo;s transition to automated systems for revenue collection including the ability for residents to use mobile money and credit cards to make payments to the county.However, a Member of the County Assembly (MCA) from Kiambu county, went to Twitter to state that these claims were false.The MCA insisted that the county has only managed to raise Sh2.2 billion through local revenues, a figure that is far below the revenue collections made by the now defunct Kiambu town council prior to 2013 when devolution was implemented.So, we ask: Is Governor Kabogo&rsquo;s claim of increased revenues due to automation true and is the MCA justified in calling him out for making a false claim?PesaCheck has researched the issue, with input from the International Budget Partnership in Kenya, and finds that the claim made by Governor Kabogo is FALSE.According to the annual county government implementation review reports prepared by the controller of budget, between 2013 and 2016, Kiambu County collected revenues amounting to KSh1.2 billion, KSh 2.11 billion and KSh2.46 billion respectively from local sources.While this indicates a year-on-year increase in revenue collection, Governor Kabogo&rsquo;s claim that the county&rsquo;s revenue collections have increased to KSh4.7 billion is FALSE.The highest amount of local revenues collected was in the last financial year when the county received KSh2.47 billion, which is KSh2.2 billion short of Governor Kabogo&rsquo;s claim of KSh4.7 billion.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

It seeks to help the public separate fact from fiction in public pronouncements about the numbers that shape our world, with a special emphasis on pronouncements about public finances that shape government&rsquo;s delivery of so-called &lsquo;Sustainable Development Goals&rsquo; or SDG public services, such as healthcare, rural development and access to water / sanitation.
