A man who injured nine people, one critically, in a rampage on Monday morning at Ohio State University was of Somali descent, say US officials.Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, rammed his car into a group of pedestrians on campus then got out and began stabbing people before police shot him dead.Police Chief Kim Jacobs said they were investigating whether it was a terrorist attack.The FBI joined the police response at the 60,000-student campus in Columbus. Somali-born Artan was living in the US as a legal permanent resident, unnamed officials told AP news agency.Law enforcement officials quoted by NBC News said the attacker had left Somalia with his family in 2007, and lived in Pakistan before resettling two years ago in the US.Asked at a news conference whether it could have been a terrorist act, Police Chief Jacobs said: "I think we have to consider that it is."He added: "Obviously with the purposeful intent that was noticed - driving on the sidewalk - we're going look at it from the potential that it was planned."The Ohio State incident began at 10:00 local time on Monday when a vehicle jumped the kerb at the campus, striking pedestrians near Watts Hall, the science and engineering building.Ohio State Police Chief Craig Stone said the driver got out of the vehicle and began stabbing bystanders with a "butcher's knife".A police officer who was nearby because of a gas leak shot the driver in less than a minute.Student Martin Schneider said he heard the car's engine revving."I thought it was an accident initially until I saw the guy come out with a knife," he said.
