Nyanza Jubilee Party members have protested against the exclusion of former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo from the secretariat to be headed by former Rarieda MP Raphael Tuju.The members, mainly former TNA officials from Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay and Migori counties, said on Monday the decision should be reconsidered.Interim JP Kisumu county coordinator Juma Midigo said Oloo was instrumental in marketing TNA in the region and his efforts cannot be wished away.He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to bring Oloo into the committee, saying his sacrifices for the party should not go unrewarded. Addressing a press conference in Kisumu, Midigo said they demand to know why he was overlooked.&ldquo;We demand to know from the President what Oloo did wrong that led to his exclusion from the vital committee, which he was part of at the last election,&rdquo; he said. Midigo said it was through Oloo&rsquo;s efforts that Jubilee&rsquo;s presence was felt in the region.Former Kisumu TNA chairman Titus Achar said the region got a raw deal in the formation of the committee to spearhead the campaigns of the party in 2017. He said other regions got the lion&rsquo;s share, while Luo Nyanza was only given the position held by Tuju.The members demanded more Luos be appointed. &ldquo;We want to know why we got a raw deal,&rdquo; Achar said. He said the issue must be resolved because like others, they, too, are party members.Uhuru appointed Tuju as the head of the Jubilee Party secretariat. He said the team&rsquo;s task is to plan and organise meetings and rallies to promote the Jubilee agenda.This, leaves Oloo&rsquo;s future undecided. He has been promoting the party&rsquo;s ideology in Nyanza, despite failing to get on the campaign team.
