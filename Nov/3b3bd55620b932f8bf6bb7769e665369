Americans living in Kenya must be now be sick and tired of the jokes about how, apparently, the US is also capable of explosions of "post-election violence" when voters feel that the just concluded presidential election did not yield the result they had expected.But this is one joke which cannot possibly be funny to Kenyans who lost property or loved ones, ten years ago, in what were some of the darkest hours in our national history.The anti-Trump demonstrators in the US may be utterly furious at the election outcome, and determined to make their anger known.But they are not pulling innocent people out of their cars and assaulting them with machetes.Nor is it likely that there will be a widespread displacement of targeted communities as we saw happen here ten years ago.We will have an election here in Kenya less than 12 months from now.The biggest lesson we can learn from the US presidential election and the unexpected victory of Donald Trump, is that accepting the victory of candidate you deeply despise, is what makes democracy possible.
