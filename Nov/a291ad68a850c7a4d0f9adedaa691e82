Murang&rsquo;a county is yet again in the middle of a bitter rivalry between supporters of Governor Mwangi Wairia and his rival Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau.The spat was sparked by the county government&rsquo;s decision to offload 10 tonnes of manure in Mumbi Grounds, where Kamau, who is vying for governor, will launch his manifesto on Saturday.The MP said the county government is attempting to block the function. On Thursday morning, a group of youths started planting grass in the stadium, which is now said to be earmarked for rehabilitation.A fierce exchange of words started after Kamau&rsquo;s supporters confronted Wairia&rsquo;s, forcing officers from the Murang&rsquo;a police station to disperse them.This happened two days after Kamau said he got a permit to use the stadium on Saturday.County sources said work at the venue is part of a programme to rehabilitate all stadiums in the county. Police are guarding the stadium and have sealed it off from the public. Kamau, whose supporters have clashed with the governor&rsquo;s several times since he declared he will vie for the seat, said the county purports to plant grass in the stadium to frustrate his event. He urged his critics to attend the launch and decide whether he deserves their support.
