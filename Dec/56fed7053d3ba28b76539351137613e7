A parliamentary committee on Finance yesterday expressed concern that some programmes under the Devolution ministry are interfering with devolved functions.The National Assembly Finance committee, chaired by Subukia MP Nelson Gaichuhie, urged the ministry to leave some roles, including slum cleaning done by the NYS, to the counties. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big mess in the ministry. There&rsquo;s confusion and Kenyans don&rsquo;t understand what devolved functions are,&rdquo; Kisumu woman representative Rose Nyamunga said. Butere MP Andrew Toboso said programmes such as construction of dams should be left to the counties.The ministry requested millions of shillings for the programmes. The committee raised the matter during the hearing of the ministry&rsquo;s Sh52.16 billion budget proposal for the 2017-18 financial year.
