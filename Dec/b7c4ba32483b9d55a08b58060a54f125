Muslim clerics at the Coast have said they will not endorse any political party or candidate in 2017.Supkem officials from the national office including Hassan Nado, Bakari Chemaswet and regional coordinator Mohdhar Khitamy on Saturday said they will be neutral. They advised faithful to vote with their conscience.This is a shift from the tradition where they endorse parties and candidates, usually for political favours.Muslims at the Coast usually vote as a bloc.In 2012, a group of Muslims led by Mohamed Dor formed the Unity Party of Kenya through which he ran for Mvita MP.The party also declared support for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.Dor lost to Abdulswamad Nassir, but was appointed Kenya&rsquo;s ambassador in Oman.In Mombasa, Christians make up about 56 per cent of the population, while Muslims account for 40 per cent. Khitamy said taking political sides confuses faithful and &ldquo;is a recipe for chaos&rdquo;.&ldquo;Leaders should not shift goal posts. We must be impartial. Do not vote on the basis of religion,&rdquo; he said at Sonara Hall in Mombasa after their regional elections.Nado said, &ldquo;We have seen the telltale signs of trouble in 2017, and would not like to see a repeat of the 2007-08 post-election violence.&rdquo;The clerics said criminal gangs are being used to wreak havoc. In Mombasa, it is estimated that there are about 12 gangs.The clerics urged Supkem&rsquo;s new leadership to preach the message of peace to the youth and shun politics.&ldquo;Politicians are using foul language. They are mobilising communities ahead of the polls. We saw it happen in 2007,&rdquo; Nado said.Khitamy said clerics want peace to prevail in the Coast region., which he described as a traditional safe haven for the people of Kenya and foreigners.&ldquo;In 1982 during the coup, people sought refuge here in Coast. Let us go back to those times,&rdquo; he said.The two urged the new leadership of Supkem to ensure Islam is not abused by elements out to destroy its image.
