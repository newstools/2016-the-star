The ODM party has said Raila Odinga will not accept results of a rigged election and accused the electoral commission of scheming to steal the 2017 polls.The Orange party fired a salvo at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, saying any decisions made by the current commissioners are null and void because they are in office illegally. The party said the secretariat headed by chief executive Ezra Chiloba is irregularly rolling out a momentous programme with the illegal commissioners . We are seeing this as a set up being deliberately made, so that the new commissioners will be used as a rubber stamp to some decisions already made when they come into office, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said yesterday. We will not accept results of a rigged election next year. Junet, who is also the party s director of elections, said Raila is concerned the IEBC has gone ahead to release a schedule for a mass voter listing exercise for January and February next year, without a properly constituted commission.Siaya Senator James Orengo said Jubilee is behind far-reaching adjustments to the key electoral timeliness brokered by the select committee on IEBC reforms.The timelines are set in the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2016, a legislative enactment made after months of negotiations between Jubilee and Cord. Orengo, who was the co-chairman of the the committee, said Jubilee is frustrating the successful implementation of the timelines, and significant infrastructure in preparation and conduct of the next general election. I am afraid that the Jubilee administration has no respect for both the Constitution and the new legislative enactments, that have radically changed the manner in which the country will conduct elections in future, Orengo said.
