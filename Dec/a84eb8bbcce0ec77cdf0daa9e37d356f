Lamu nurses will be rewarded handsomely for not taking part in the nationwide strike. Health executive Mohamed Kombo did not, however, specify what kind of reward.&ldquo;We shall do everything to ensure they work comfortably and effectively,&rdquo; he said yesterday. &ldquo;Whatever will be decided in Nairobi, we shall do the same for our nurses. Not forgetting that we will reward them for the bold move of choosing to save lives [instead of going on strike].&rdquo;Kombo spoke at King Fahd Hospital, where he attended to patients. All hospitals and dispensaries are fully functional, even as some of the doctors have joined their counterparts in the strike. Lamu has more than 200 nurses and at least 10 doctors.
