Negotiations between the Ministry of Health and doctors to end the 2-week long strike hit a deadlock on Saturday.Doctors said they will continue with their strike "since the state is not committed to implement the CBA they signed in 2013".The talks between the parties were spearheaded by the Ministry of Labour.In a statement, KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga said that doctors want the document which was agreed upon and procedurally signed on June 27, 2013 implemented. "So far we have no proposal from the government on how to implement the CBA which they procedurally signed and have since acknowledged," he said.The doctor's union said that they had asked emergency services like M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&#279;res (MSF) to help those in need of medical services."Earlier before meeting with the government team, we had met MSF country director and other non-state health actors who registered urgent and serious concerns that the government is ignoring and hiding the plight of millions of Kenyans who have had all public hospitals functionally closed," the statement read.Read: Labour court declares doctors strike illegalAlso read: Medical school lecturers join doctors strike, civil servants union issue parallel threat The strike, which will enter its third week starting Monday, has adversely affected maternal and infant care.The doctors have urged the government to treat the issue with the urgency it deserves for the good of the public."It is very very unfortunate that 13 days into a national doctors strike, there is little commitment from government to help both doctors and members of the public who have remained victims of a dysfunctional health system," Oluga said.He said that they are willing to engage the government in as far as the CBA will be implemented.More on this: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreement
