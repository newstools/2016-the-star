Nakuru governor aspirant John Mututho has asked Kalenjins in the Rift Valley to stop fighting their "anointed" leader Deputy President William Ruto.Mututho said in Kuresoi South constituency on Saturday that Ruto was a reputable leader who had the whole country's backing.&ldquo;It is sad that some of you are fighting your own son who has backing from all corners of the country. [He is about to get power]. You should change because [you are painting] a bad picture&rdquo; he said.He said, while doing rounds to wish the underprivileged a Merry Christmas, that the DP will take over the top seat after President Uhuru Kenyatta.Mututho further assured residents that the Kikuyu community had confidence in Ruto and will "undoubtedly" vote for him after Uhuru's second term.&ldquo;Ruto is a good leader and has gone against all odds of life to reach where he is. His presidential aspiration is unstoppable," he said.The aspiring governor urged the electorate to give the Jubilee administration a chance to complete its projects.He said he was "almost sure" Jubilee will win the August 8, 2017 election, and likened supporting any losing party to milking a bull.Mututho reminded residents of how he defended Ruto in Parliament when he was accused of looting money meant for maize while he was the Minister for Agriculture.&ldquo;I am optimistic about winning the Nakuru governor seat and due to the good working relationship I have with Uhuru and Ruto, I will bring development down to the county,&rdquo; he said.Read: Long knives out for William Ruto in 2022 raceAlso read: Uhuru settled on Ruto as 2022 successor - State HouseMututho was with Mourine Chebet, a 26-year old orphan who will be his running mate.The former Naivasha MP earlier said he was not visiting the less fortunate to campaign.His visits to Kuresoi North and South came two days after he hosted hundreds of street families from across the county at his Lanet home, where he gave them food and clothes."I did not come to campaign but just to wish you merry Christmas," he said in Kiptagich, adding he to show humanity, the love for Christ and compassion. Mututho said leaders should love everyone regardless of their economic status and accused Governor Kinuthia Mbugua of unfairly distributing resources to the 11 subcounties."To ensure equal and effective representation, I have chosen this girl (Chebet) to ensure my government gets down to the needy," he said.He added that his performance under the previous posts he held showed he was well-placed to transform the county.Read: Governor Mbugua makes a good cop, not politician - MututhoAlso read: Mututho's plan B: Governor of NakuruMututho said he will campaign rigorously from February while Chebet said she will ensure neglected people are fully represented.
