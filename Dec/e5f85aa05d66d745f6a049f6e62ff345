CONTINGENTS of heavily armed police officers that barricaded all roads leading to Parliament Buildings were quickly withdrawn yesterday, moments after senators protested their presence.The security offices, drawn from regular police, the paramilitary Administration Police and the General Service Unit, were withdrawn even as Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro ordered the Committee on National Security and Foreign Relations to investigate under what circumstances the cops were deployed around Parliament Buildings.The police presence coincided with the special sitting of the Senate called to consider the controversial amendments to the Election Laws passed by the National Assembly last week.Ethuro told the furious senators that the deployment was done contrary to his directive to Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery not to deploy the police in and around the Houses of Parliament.&ldquo;We don't need a police presence; when I saw them I called Nkaissery [to say] that we did not need them and they were causing confusion. Police should facilitate Members&rsquo; access to Parliament and if any senator was prevented to come and perform his or her duties this is totally wrong," Ethuro said.&ldquo;For the police to create unnecessary attention is the last thing we needed; in this regard, I direct the committee to investigate and bring a report on why police came to Parliament. This is not a police state," the Speaker directed.Even after committee chairman and Garissa Senator Yusuf Hajji broke the news on the floor of the House that the security had been withdrawn, Ethuro insisted that the committee should proceed to investigate the matter.Making the ruling, Ethuro said that it was wrong for the police to be deployed within Parliament yet senators, unlike their counterparts in the National Assembly, have always conducted their business with decorum.&ldquo;We came here so that we don't fight but to debate and persuade each other, then vote. The Majority will have their way and Minority will have their say. I am therefore directing the police to withdraw because we do not need them here. We have not asked for any police assistance because we do not need them here,&rdquo; he said.He however overruled senators who had proposed that the House proceedings be adjourned until the officers withdrew.Ethuro&rsquo;s ruling came after the senators registered their frustrations at being dropped far from Parliament and forced to walk while those who drove themselves had to spend time looking for parking space in the CBD.Senators Boni Khalwale (Kakamega) and Janet Ong'era (nominated), rising on a point of order, kicked off the storm, after they demanded to know from the Speaker if he had directed that the police be deployed.&ldquo;I was denied access to this House, I took refuge at the KICC. Was it your order to have police? If it was not your order, would you confirm that this House has lost independence and has been held hostage by the Executive?&rdquo; Khalwale said.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri, who told the House that he travelled from his county at 5am yesterday, threatened to take legal action against whoever deployed the police.Siaya Senator James Orengo condemned the presence of the police officers, saying it was difficult for him to access the precincts of Parliament, adding that the move by the Executive was undermining the privileges given to senators under the standing orders.Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki and his Minority counterpart Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, senators Wilfred Machage (Migori), Stephen Sang (Nandi), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Markwet) also condemned the presence of police.Wetang&rsquo;ula said that the heavy presence of police officers portrayed Parliament as a police state, yet its business is to make laws.Kiraitu, who came to the defence of the police officers, said that they were doing so following what happened in the National Assembly, when Members engaged in fistfights during debate on amending the laws.Kindiki condemned the heavy presence of police, saying whoever ordered them deployed needed to not only be condemned but publicly ridiculed.Murkomen said while it is right to condemn the police, Members should also condemn themselves for previous misconduct.
