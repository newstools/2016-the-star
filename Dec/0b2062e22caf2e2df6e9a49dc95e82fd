Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi have told Senator Kipchumba Murkomen to carry his cross in the Sh1.6 billion NYS scandal.They said the senator should explain under what circumstances he received cash from the service. The two accused Murkomen of trying to &ldquo;divert&rdquo; attention from his involvement in the scam by creating political differences between Rift Valley leaders and Deputy President William Ruto.Keter and Sudi on Sunday said they have evidence showing Murkomen bought property in Eldoret town using proceeds from the NYS scam.But yesterday, Murkomen denied receiving NYS cash. He said Keter and Sudi have criminal cases pending in the courts. &ldquo;One has been linked to forgery of academic papers, and the other one tried to get trailers to pass through a weighbridge corruptly,&rdquo; he said. Murkomen said the two just two weeks ago apologised to Ruto for being rebellious, but are still &ldquo;blundering&rdquo; when they are supposed to be undergoing &ldquo;political rehabilitation&rdquo;.&ldquo;I am the one who has been trying to help rehabilitate them, but my efforts have hit a brick wall and I now leave them to anyone else, or the world, to deal with them,&rdquo; he said.Murkomen told the MPs to present their evidence to the EACC or police. &ldquo;But they should be careful because their characters are known and they might remain at the police station or at the EACC,&rdquo; he said.Sudi and Keter said Murkomen is a liar. &ldquo;We want to ask Murkomen to stop equating himself to Ruto. We are all equal as leaders in the Rift Valley and he should stop creating divisions among our leaders and instead deal with the NYS scam,&rdquo; Sudi said.Keter said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us stories about PAC and Parliament. Carry your cross. Tell us where the money you got went to because Kenyans need it.&rdquo;
