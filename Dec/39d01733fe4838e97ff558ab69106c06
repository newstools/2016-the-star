There is no room for that,&rdquo; said Muthee, adding that they are embracing openness in everything they do for accountability purposes.&ldquo;Remember we are involving the IAAF in every step we make since this is their event. Hosting a successful event is the main focus of the Local Organising Committee and all the other local partners since this will be crucial for Kenya in hosting bigger events in the future.&rdquo;Muthee also revealed that funds for procuring equipment for Team Kenya have already been approved.&ldquo;I thought the equipment was delivered,&rdquo; he quipped. &ldquo;The approvals were done a long time ago and it is upon those concerned to ensure the equipment is purchased whether locally or through shipment.&rdquo;In addition, he said, schools/camps hosting athletes in preparation for the event will be facilitated in areas of accommodation, food, water and medical services while coaches and athletes will receive their allowances.
