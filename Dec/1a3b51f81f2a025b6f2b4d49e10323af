A multisectoral technical team is exploring the possibility of employing satellite technology as an alternative for transmission of election results from far-flung areas which do not have network access.The team, comprising ICT experts from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, the Communication Authority of Kenya and various independent institutions, will submit its report to Parliament on January 20.IEBC chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba told the Senate Standing Committee on Legal Affairs the report will offer guidance on the viability, turnaround time and cost of using satellite in relaying election results.&ldquo;We have a technical team working on the possibility. We have had a lot of consultations and more are going on before a report is prepared,&rdquo; Chiloba said when he appeared before the committee chaired by Busia Senator Amos Wako.The country is racing against time to adopt the best electoral infrastructure that will cover 22 per cent of the country that has no third generation ( 3G network) coverage ahead of the August 8 general election.The IEBC argues the 3G network is required to transmit election data. IT experts told the committee, which is collecting public views on the contentious election laws, reliable network coverage must be provided to ensure scanned copies of results from polling stations countrywide are relayed to the national tallying centre in Nairobi.&ldquo;After the results have been announced, all the forms from the 50,000 plus polling stations across the country must be transmitted through a reliable network to Nairobi,&rdquo; Chiloba said.Wako had asked the commission if it is working on the use of satellite for relaying election results from vulnerable regions after it emerged 2.5 million voters could be locked out of the election if network is not fixed. Chiloba told the committee the current law requires all returning officers from the 290 constituencies to physically deliver election declaration forms to the National Tallying Centre.
