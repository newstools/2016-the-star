UAP Old Mutual is banking on Christmas season to boost insurance sales among homeowners.The covers are also meant to protect against fires, riots, injuries and illness to staff employed in homesteads.The group's insurance managing director James Wambugu said homeowners usually take the covers around the festive season.&ldquo;Most people go on holiday around this period, leaving their houses empty which increases the likelihood of burglaries. Additionally homeowners face potential losses from leaked pipes and other accidents since they are not present to take immediate action when such disasters occur,&rdquo; he said.He said interest in travel insurance is also expected to pick up due to losses associated with misplaced luggage, cancelled trips and medical expenses.&ldquo;Marine and speciality insurance are other major areas that are eyeing,&rdquo; he said.
