More than 38 children on Friday benefitted from free ear surgical operations at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu.About 400 people were screened and some treated for minor infections. It was conducted by Operation Ear Drop and the Safaricom Foundation. It targeted hearing impairment that required surgery. It was a relief for many people. Usually, one has to have Sh20,000 for the surgery. Safaricom Foundation trustee Stephen Chege said this was part of an ongoing Sh3 million outreach programme that aims to reach eight counties, the others being Laikipia, Kisii, Kakamega, Nyeri, Machakos, Embu and Nakuru.He said on Friday the Foundation aims to transform patients lives. Hearing loss can have adverse effects on one s social and working life and lead to isolation and withdrawal, Chege said, adding they will adjust the funding in the next financial year based on the feedback they get. Operation Ear Drop chairperson Chemi Omamo said they will also focus on adults and surgeries in their middle ears.
