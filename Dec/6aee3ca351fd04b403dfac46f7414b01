Glitzy night ahead for SportPesa Premier League achieversAnother glitzy night beckons for Sportpesa Premier League players, coaches and officials as the 2016 Sportpesa Football of the Year is crowned at a Nairobi hotel.This season there was no particularly outstanding individual to make the best player award a foregone conclusion. Any of the five nominees &ndash; Tusker&rsquo;s title winning duo of midfielder Humphrey Mieno and goalkeeper David Okello, golden boot winner John Makwata of Ulinzi Stars, the young duo of buccaneering Gor Mahia left back Eric Ouma and promising Western Stima forward Kenneth Muguna &ndash; wil all be confident of bagging the coveted individual award.Makwata though wll start as a slight favourite having been a picture of consistency throughout the campaign. He leads the scoring charts with 15 goals. That achievement saw the Ulinzi side finish third.Mieno and Okello were regulars in a Tusker team that led from start to finish to end Gor&rsquo;s three year reign.For that alone the duo will feel hard done by should either of them not emerge triumphant by the end of today.The brewers are certain to take home a sizeable part of the awards on offer. One they most certainly should win &ndash; is the coach of the year award.Paul Nkata the affable Ugandan tactician continued to show that he has the innate ability of transforming the sides he leads. He is odds on favourite to claim the award ahead of his peer Henry Omino of Western Stima or Gor&rsquo;s Ze Maria.Noah Abich overlooked for the award last season despite being the top goal scoring defender while at Mathare United will hope to go one better and claim the defender of the year gong.His goals and assist were crucial in helping Sofapaka escape relegation by the skin of their teeth.However stiff competition is expected from Gor youngster Ouma.The 2016 Kenyan Premier League Footballer of the Year nominees:Most Valuable Player - Humphrey Mieno (Tusker FC), Erick Ouma (Gor Mahia), David Okello (Tusker), Kenneth Muguna (Western Stima), John Makwatta (Ulinzi Stars).Midfielder of the Year - Humphrey Mieno (Tusker), Kenneth Muguna (Western Stima), Whyvonne Isuza (Mathare United), Hillary Echesa (Chemelil Sugar), Francis Kahata (Gor Mahia).Defender of the Year - Musa Mohammed (Gor Mahia), Noah Abich (Sofapaka), George Owino (Mathare United), James Situma (Tusker), Erick Ouma (Gor Mahia).Goalkeeper of the Year - Patrick Matasi (Posta Rangers), Boniface Oluoch (Gor Mahia), James Saruni (Ulinzi Stars), David Okello (Tusker FC), Michalel Wanyika (Kakamega Homeboyz).New Player of the Year - Erick Ouma (Gor Mahia), Kenneth Muguna (Western Stima), Calvin Odongo (Posta Rangers), Oliver Maloba (Nairobi City Stars), Brian Marita (WesternStima).Coach of the Year - Paul Nkata (Tusker), Zedekiah Otieno (Posta Rangers), Henry Omino (Western Stima), Francis Baraza (Chemelil Sugar) and Marcelo Ferreira (Gor Mahia).Fair Play Team of the Year - Sony Sugar, Mathare United, Gor Mahia, Kakamega Homeboyz, Western Stima.Fair Play Player of the Year - Jared Obwoge (Chemelil Sugar), Francis Kahata (Gor Mahia), Amos Asembeka (Sony Sugar), Ali Bhai (Kakamega Homeboyz).Team Manager of the Year - Moses Jobita (Western Stima), George Opondo (Tusker), Pascal Ochieng&rsquo; (Posta Rangers), David Mwangi (Ulinzi Stars), Hillary Ouma (Chemelil Sugar).Centre referee of the Year - Anthony Ogwayo, Davies Omweno, David Mulongo, Andrew Juma, Badir Yassin.Assistant referee of the Year - John Alando, Gilbert Cheruiyot, Steven Oduor, Peter Sabatia, Mary Njoroge.
