He wrote the email at 2300hours on Thursday night," the officer said.In the letter, Everett said: "The vessel has been approved by the US Coastguard and is available for inspection at your convenience for compliance with Kenya regulations,""Its for private use no more than 5NM from shore," the email reads in part.The amphibious vessel, registration number KCK 751J, has been cruising in the Indian Ocean and ferrying holidaymakers at the Jomo Kenyatta public beach.KMA acting director general Cosmas Cherop told the Star on phone that the law and procedures should be followed regardless of who owns the vehicle."Let us respect human and marine life. Officers are on the ground. Let then them finish their findings," Cherop said.The said vessel weighs about 1.5 tonnes and can cruise at 40 miles per hour on water; its wheels work as propellers when in water.The Star has been reliably informed that influential Mombasa businessmen and politicians have contacted Everett in a bid to buy the vessel estimated to cost $259,900 (Sh26,641,569).Read: [VIDEO] KMA sleuths look for owner of sailing car
