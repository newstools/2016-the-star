We want to introduce the game to them at a young age and this is our strategy to ensure thast rugby is introduced to all secondary schools.&rdquo;He further noted that Elimu Academy, Kisii, Rianyanchabera, Nyanchwa Adventist, Migori, Itare and Nyamasaria are some of the primary schools which have embraced rugby in Nyanza.Already, four boys and five girls have been awarded scholarships to study and play rugby at Menengai High School and Shimba Hills respectively, Bosire added.
