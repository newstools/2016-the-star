The High Court has temporarily stopped the decision of the NGO board to deregister IFES and ban its activities.Justice George Odunga gave the order on Friday after activist Okiya Omitatah argued that the International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) was not a Non-Governmental Organisation.Omtatah further told Odunga that NGOs board boss Fazul Mahamed was not competent enough to issue such a directive.He also accused Mahamed was using his position to disparage and destroy IFES as has allegedly been the case with other organisations.The activist said the matter was urgent given that general election is set for August 2017.&ldquo;The impugned actions of the respondents through Fazul Mahamed have a direct bearing on the conduct of the general election," he said.He added in papers fled in court that the respondents' actions violated the bill of rights and lacked basis.&ldquo;Unless the petition is heard and determined the petitioner and the people of Kenya will suffer great loss," he said.Mahamed outlawed operations of the IFES, stopping a Sh2 billion US-funded election education programme.But it emerged that IFES was legally registered and regulated under the Companies Act, thus falls under Attorney General's office.Read: Kenya cancels Sh2 billion US civic education fundIFES&rsquo; Kenya Electoral Assistance Program (KEAP), funded through a cooperative agreement from USAID, is aimed at supporting Kenya's efforts toward peaceful, credible and inclusive 2017 elections.The programme supports the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and key electoral institutions to promote participation of women, youth and persons with disabilities in the political process.It also helps encourage domestic observation activities and assist conflict mitigation efforts.
