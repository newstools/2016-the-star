The High Court in Kisii has ordered a lawyer who represented South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya (pictured) in a petition to pay him Sh3.3 million he was awarded by the court.Resident judge Winfridah Okwany ordered lawyer Omwanza Ombati to give Nyamweya the money together with interest starting from December 2010.Nyamweya was awarded the money after he successfully challenged the election of Omingo Magara as South Mugirango MP, but the lawyers did not pay him.&ldquo;The court awarded over Sh7.5 million after I successfully won the petition out of which I was supposed to take Sh3.3 million and the rest was for the lawyers,&rdquo; Nyamweya said.&ldquo;I decided to seek court redress because I have waited for long to receive the money after the commission paid it through the lawyer,&rdquo; he added.Ombati said he withheld the money because Nyamweya had not paid him in other cases he represented him in, in Nairobi. But judge Okwany said the cases had no relation with the election petition and therefore he should have given the MP the court award.Ombati&rsquo;s lawyer Edward Begi asked the court to give them a 30-day stay order as the defendant makes an appropriate application over the ruling. Nyamweya&rsquo;s lawyer Ogutu Mboya did not object.
