PRESIDENT Uhuru Kenyatta has for the umpteenth made a tour of the Luhya region in an effort to woo the vote bloc to his side of the divide.The President&rsquo;s sojourn is a continuation of the near-weekly ritual his deputy, William Ruto, has perfected through his fundraisers that have become his byword in the region.The Luhya region is critical for the major political players as the country heads to the 2017 general election.As the second most populous community, the Luhya have the numbers on whose back Raila Odinga support is anchored and which give the leader of the Opposition the political strength that he wields.Main story:NASA is a tribal outfit, says UhuruThe region is important for Jubilee because cutting away some of this support will significantly reduce Raila&rsquo;s political stock in national politics.Almost needless to say, Uhuru is eying the Luhya vote with the sole desire to ensure that he wins the 2017 Presidential race Round One.The region is important if Uhuru is to get the 50+1 per cent of the vote in the first round. In any case, Uhuru must win the next election convincingly to allay fears of his marginal win last time.Getting any sizeable part of the Luhya vote will definitely boost Uhuru&rsquo;s standing, while at the same time cutting into Raila&rsquo;s support base.This is important because the Luhya remain the only hope for Uhuru if he is to win the first round with a wider margin. Kisii, the Coast and the Maasai regions have tesolutely refused to play ball and are hostile to all Jubilee overtures, which leaves the Luhya as the only hope.The problem, though, is that Jubilee&rsquo;s approach towards the region is feeble and shaky. It is top-down, with little or no involvement of the local people.Ruto has tried with his never-ending fundraisers with little impact. He has raised funds and thrown jibes at local leaders, but his mission remains far from a success.The President is in Western often, but only to laugh at and to lecture the locals &ndash; too busy to listen to residents&rsquo; concerns.The President should find the time to listen to the locals, because clearly he has the wrong priorities for the region. And there lies Jubilee&rsquo;s greatest problem with this region.If Jubilee has to get to the region, it must design a strategy that works: Involve the people.
