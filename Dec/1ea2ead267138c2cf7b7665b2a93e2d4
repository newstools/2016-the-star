Lugari MP Ayub Savula presided over 100 fundraisers in four days to beat Wednesday's deadline, when the law banning politicians participation in harambees came into effect.Savula doled out Sh7 million in harambees for schools, women and welfare groups, churches and boda boda groups between Saturday and Tuesday.He said he had scheduled the fundraisers long before realising that most of them fell outside the IEBC fundraising deadline.The Elections Amendment Act passed on Tuesday last week bars politicians from participating directly or indirectly in fundraisers, eight months to the general election.Politicians found dishing out money in fundraisers risk being barred from running in the August 8 general election.The law also bars politicians from contributing money to the sick within the same period. &ldquo;We have now closed the chapter for harambees until August 10, 2017,&rdquo; Savula said.Savula, on Friday blamed Jubilee and ODM MPs for passing the anti-harambee law.
