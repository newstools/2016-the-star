Three Northeastern counties have sued the government for allegedly disseminating false population data with an aim of slashing revenue allocation.Garissa, Wajir and Mandera couties say the government used figures other than the enumerated census results of 2009, which meant reduction of the population by 39.7 per cent.They want the court to issue temporary orders blocking the usage of &lsquo;adjusted&rsquo; census results as a formula to determine shareable revenue.The suit papers indicate the population of the three counties, when census was done in 2009, was 2.3 million but in the &lsquo;adjusted&rsquo; census result it was reflected as 1.3 million.The census results were released on August 31, 2010.
