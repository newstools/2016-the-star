Kilifi county this week signed a Sh2.5 billion deal with Kenya Agribusiness and Agroindustry Alliance and JiangLian Heavy Industry Company of China for setting up of a fruit and vegetable food park. The deal targets farmers, input suppliers, processors, retailers, wholesalers, exporters and other business service providers. &ldquo;The Kilifi Agro-Food Park will transform the economy of the county through creating better integrated value chains which result in greater value addition to farm produce,&rdquo; governor Amason Kingi said. &ldquo;It will also boost income of farmers, lower post-harvest losses, reduced price volatility and increased exposure to more efficient and effective technology and practices.&rdquo; This is part of the Sh6 billion commitment the two firms made during the Kilifi International Investment Conference in October. The county said it had received commitments amounting to about Sh300 billion from different investors at the forum. &ldquo;This is the first phase of disbursement. The money is being channeled through the China Africa Bank,&rdquo; KAAA chief executive Lucy Muchoki said. &ldquo;Through the partnership, over 20,000 Kilifi farmers are set to receive farm inputs, training and extension services to ensure high yields which will be necessary to sustain the plant.&rdquo;Feasibility studies have shown Kilifi as the best strategic location because it is a rich production zone for fruits and vegetables and it is easily accessible by both road and sea providing logistical advantages for domestic and international trade. &ldquo;This park will be situated within our borders and we have also made it a mandatory provision in this agreement that 70 percent of the human labor will go directly to local,&rdquo; Kingi said.
