The government will conduct fresh recruitment for the Moi University vice chancellor after the interviews which were done in May were cancelled. Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has mandated the university council to readvertise the position. He on Friday extended the tenure of acting vice chancellor Laban Ayiro for another three months. In a letter to Ayiro, Matiang&rsquo;i said the move to extend the tenure is to provide management stability at the university and give the council time to recruit a substantive VC for the troubled university. Ayiro was appointed in an acting capacity in September, sparking off protests from political leaders in the North Rift led by Governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet.They argued that Prof Isaac Kosgey was the best suited to replace Richard Mibey. They stormed the university and demanded Kosgey be appointed.
