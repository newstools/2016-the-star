The Kiambu government has launched a campaign to ensure all adult residents have ID cards. The campaign will be at Witeithie AP Camp today starting at 8am. Witeithie administrator James Gichuru, area chief Muchui Muiruri and assistant chief James Nyoike have been going door-to-door urging all adults to come to the AP camp today to register for ID cards and replace lost ones. This will enable the applicants to get vote cards to participate in next yearâ€™s general election, Gichuru said. This is the second time ID registration has been held in the area in a month. Gichuru said similar exercises are ongoing around the county.
