Silt from the standard gauge railway construction site could be washed downhill and fill up Lake Magadi, experts have warned. They said adequate drainage should be put in place to save the lake.Already, poor drainage along the Mai Mahiu-Narok road has seen rich soil from parts of Narok washed into the lake, which is the mainstay of hundreds of residents.This came up during a stakeholder&rsquo;s consultation meeting on the multibillion-shilling railway at Satellite Naivasha. Construction of the Nairobi-Naivasha section of the railway will begin next year.TATA Magadi Company senior manager Francis Sakimpa said there are major fears of environmental degradation once the project begins.He told the meeting that poor workmanship has led to all the water from the main road diverted to the lake and this has affected the mining of soda ash.
