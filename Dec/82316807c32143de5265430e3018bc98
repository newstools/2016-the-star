The Jubilee administration is coercing opposition MPs to amend the election laws in Parliament, Cord leader Raila Odinga has said.He said the presence of GSU officers around Parliament Buildings is a form of intimidation aimed at scaring the legislators to succumb to what Jubilee wants changed in the laws.Opposition MPs will not allow any amendment proposed by the Jubilee side of Parliament, Raila said.&ldquo;No amount of intimidation will make us change our mind. Don&rsquo;t think sending security officers around Parliament will do anything,&rdquo; he added.The opposition chief said the Joint Select Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms, whose mandate was to oversee the making of the new laws, agreed and passed the laws without any amendments. He questioned why the amendments were being slotted in by Jubilee at the tail end.Raila said the move by Jubilee MPs to push for the amendments is a clear indication that the ruling party had sensed an early defeat in next year&rsquo;s polls.&ldquo;We were together when the select committee members formulated and unanimously agreed to pass the laws without putting a comma or full stop. Why is Jubilee making a sharp about-turn in the last minute if this does not mean it has sensed a defeat in the upcoming elections?&rdquo; he asked.Raila spoke on Tuesday to a group of Luo elders during the ongoing Luo Cultural Festival in Homa Bay town.He urged opposition MPs to soldier on in rejecting the proposed amendments.Turkana Governors Josephat Nanok said, &ldquo;All the noise you hear from the Jubilee side is the noise of somebody who has lost political ground.&rdquo;He urged opposition leaders to remain united to kick Jubilee out of power.
