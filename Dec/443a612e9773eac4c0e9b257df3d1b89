Under the agreement framework, the university will expand the range of specialised courses to those in the security management industry.&ldquo;The recently introduced MSc in Security Management and Forensics Studies will benefit from this arrangement,&rdquo; Kioni said.He said the partnership will contribute to national security through education, technology transfer and linkages to other institutions abroad.Some 348 students graduated during the event.Kioni said in September, the university launched BEd in engineering courses for the training of TVET trainers and technicians.This, he said, was possible through the AfDB scholarship which was granted to the university early this year. The capacity building for the TVET will create the required workforce to anchor existing and newly established institutions. Kioni said TVET will play a fundamental role towards the realisation of Vision 2030 in developing technical skills for a demand-driven economy.
