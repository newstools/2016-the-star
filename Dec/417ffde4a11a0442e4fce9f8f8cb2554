The four APs charged with the murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver will remain in custody until the case is determined.High Court judge Jessie Lesiit yesterday said despite bail being a constitutional right, the court cannot set the free owing to the gravity of the offence and the facts surrounding the abduction, torture and the heinous killings.The judge said the DPP had presented compelling reasons for Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Mwangi, Silvia Wanjiku and Stephen Chebulet to remain in custody. &ldquo;The likelihood of a repeat of a similar offence cannot be overruled. And since the accused person are many, their release is likely to send cold shivers down the spines of potential witnesses and victims of the affected families,&rdquo; the judge said.She said the court cannot consider only the rights of accused person, but it had a duty to protect the public interest.&ldquo;Given the fact that the deceased were coming from [Mavoko] law courts over a criminal case, when they were abducted and later killed, the scenario affects and stands to affect young lawyers handling such sensitive cases for their clients,&rdquo; the judge said.The mutilated bodies of Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were retrieved from the Oldonyo Sabuk River on June 30, stashed in gunny bags. They went missing shortly after appearing at the Mavoko law courts on June 23.
