Governor Evans Kidero on Thursday relaunched the tarmacking of the Mihango-Kayole road for Sh250 million. It is a key access road, however, work was stalled by a dispute between the county government and the military. KDF took over 5,000 acres through which the road passes. Embakasi Garrisson soldiers in October dug trenches across the road, guarded the place to keep away residents and chased away 500 quarry workers. It took the intervention of President Uhuru Kenyatta to end the stand off. The President ordered KDF to fence off the land and leave space for the road. Speaking during the relaunch, Kidero ordered the road completed within seven months. The contractor must finish this work before July next year, he said. Kidero said the land belongs to the county, which acquired it in the 1970s from the Kayole Residents Association. He took the matter to court, which ruled in residents favour.
