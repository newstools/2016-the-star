Striking doctors and nurses selfishly putting the country at risk are incurring God&rsquo;s wrath due to their love of material things, Muslim clerics in Mombasa have said.The clerics, members of the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya, yesterday said the industrial action by the health workers is unfounded. &ldquo;There is nowhere in the world that a dispute has been settled by any kind of war. The health workers should find an alternative way of resolving their dispute with the government,&rdquo; CIPK organising secretary Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa said.He said humanity should take precedence in every situation, not money. &ldquo;The knowledge they have is a blessing from God. They should not mock Him by denying their services to innocent patients,&rdquo; Khalifa said. &ldquo;The Health ministry officials will carry the sins of those who will suffer or die due to this strike. But the heaviest burden will be on the striking doctors and nurses.&rdquo;
