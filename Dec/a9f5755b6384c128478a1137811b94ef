Nyando MP Fred Outa on Sunday dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s call for politicians to tone down their rhetoric, saying he is hypocritical, as he and DP William Ruto constantly abuse Cord leader Raila Odinga.He said they are not cowards and will respond accordingly if they continue with mudslinging. Outa urged Raila to continue talking boldly about the wanton corruption bedeviling the country, citing the NYS scam, Eurobond and Health funds, as some of the mega scandals that undermine Kenya&rsquo;s progress.MP Oburu Oginga expressed similar views.
