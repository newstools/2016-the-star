An athlete and guide for Kenyan Paralympian Henry Wanyoike has gone to court seeking to bar two companies from using his image to promote their product &ldquo;Deep Heat&rdquo; on the social media platform.Joseph Kibunja has named Rohto Mentholatum Limited and Harleys Limited as the defendants in the case.Rohto Mentholatum is a subsidiary of the Rohto Group, a company that deals with Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG&rsquo;s).Harleys on the other hand is also subsidiary of the Rohto Group.Through Lawyer Julius Njoroge, Kibunja claims the defendants have been using his image on the social media platform particularly Facebook, to market Deep Heat East Africa without his consent. Kibunja says he has not been remunerated in any form by Rohto and Harleys for using his image on various advertising media like billboards, Facebook, promotional calendars, sponsorship events and fliers.&ldquo;They continue to profit from the usage of my image without any benefit to me,&rdquo; he says.Kibunja is a well reputed athlete who has featured and won several national and international athletic events. These include the 2003 Singapore Marathon where he was the first runners up, 2004 Hong Kong Half Marathon, 2005 Great City Run (United Kingdom), 2005 Nairobi Marathon (21Km) 2005 Bangkok Marathon and many others.He has also featured as a guide for Henry Wanyoike in several Paralympic events where he has greatly assisted the said Henry.He wants the court to declare the usage of his image by the defendants in the promotion of their product without his consent illegal.He also wants to be compensated for the usage of his image by the defendants for their own gain.According to the court documents, Kibunja says sometime in the year 2013, he realised his image was being used on a billboard to advertise and market a product by the name Deep Heat produced by Rohto and distributed by Harleys without his consent.He says later he discovered his image had also been used on several occasions to advertise and market the said product by the name Deep Heat in various media outlets among them being "The Asian Weekly" promotional calendar, circulated globally, promotional fliers and in corporate sponsorship materials such as banners, fliers and tee shirts.He says he raised the issues with Rohto but he was promised they would look into it by awarding a suitable compensation. His attempts to follow up with the defendants over the issue of remuneration were however, ignored.Rohto and Harleys also allege the reason they never sought Kibunja&rsquo;s consent was due to his previous involvement with the Henry Wanyoike Foundation, from which he resigned on January 13, 2015.Kibunja however avers that even as a member of a foundation, he was and remains a professional athlete and he still has an interest in his image. He claims anyone who wishes to use his image for commercial gain ought to seek and obtain his consent and remunerate him for the same.
