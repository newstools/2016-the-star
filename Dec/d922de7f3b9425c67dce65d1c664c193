Muslim clerics at the Coast have joined hands to preach peace ahead of the general election.The Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council on Wednesday announced it will join the peace campaign started by the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims 10 days ago.Kemnac senior adviser Sheikh Juma Abdulrazak said politics is about the policies of individual parties or politicians. &ldquo;We ask Coast politicians and their supporters not to allow themselves to fight each other on the basis of parties, tribe or religion,&rdquo; he said.Abdulrazak said politicians should sell their policies and allow the electorate to vote with their conscience.This is the same message Supkem&rsquo;s Sheikh Mudhar Khitamy preached on December 17.Khitamy and other national Supkem officials, including Hassan ole Nado and Bakari Chemaswet, said they will be neutral players and will not endorse any political party or individual.They said they want the faithful to vote with their conscience. Abdulrazak urged Coast politicians to speak with one voice.&ldquo;Let us forget the past and focus on the future,&rdquo; he said. Abdulrazak said people should not be fought because they are in certain political parties.Muslim clerics supported Jubilee at the 2013 geenral election, but their stand now could complicate President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection bid.It is expected that the head of state, who is in Mombasa, will schedule a meeting with Muslim leaders to galvanise their relatively small support base.Kemnac&rsquo;s message that Coast residents and politicians should choose their own political destiny will cause confusion among Muslim youth, who have traditionally relied on the clerics to guide them in political matters.Politicians will find it difficult to sway them without the influence of the clerics.
