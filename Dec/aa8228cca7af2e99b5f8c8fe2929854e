Police said they were holding him for a series of crimes.CASE THROWN OUT&ldquo;Kahiro was taken to Kikuyu law courts where he told the magistrate of his ordeal while in police custody. The case was thrown out,&rdquo; Wanyoike said.He said that after Kahiro disappeared, &ldquo;We went to the police station and the officers denied rearresting him.
