Saada Juma, 35, breaks down as she narrates her frustration and pain in searching for her husband who went missing in police custody.She said on February 2, 2014, she was watching on TV the police raid on the Masjid Musa, Mombasa, when she spotted her husband. &ldquo;I saw my husband Hemed Salim. Unlike other people who were being bundled into a police lorry, he was isolated and put in a police Land Rover,&rdquo; Saada told the Star yesterday.&ldquo;That was the last time I saw him. Our search in police stations and morgues has been unsuccessful and the pursuit of justice has been frustrating. It&rsquo;s traumatising and difficult to explain to our three children the whereabouts of their father. It is better to know a person is dead than missing,&rdquo; she said.Saada&rsquo;s family is among 81 families at the Coast who have suffered anxiety and pain living with memories of their relatives. They were executed or &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo; in police security operations, they say.Their stories are contained in the report &lsquo;What Do We Tell the Families?&rsquo; released yesterday at Laico Regency, Nairobi, by Haki Africa.It contains details of 81 cases of killings and disappearances at the Coast between 2012-2016. Haki Africa said it investigated extensively and obtained compelling evidence.The state always says individual officers are to blame, not the system.Its report includes 22 deaths caused by excessive use of force by police, four deaths in police custody, 31 extrajudicial executions and 24 enforced disappearances.Similar documentary reports have been made by the state Kenya Human Rights Commission and Human Rights Watch.Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said most victims were youths and all were Muslims, perceived as real or potential terrorists.&ldquo;We often asked why should people care about killings of people described as terror suspects,&rdquo; Khalid said. &ldquo;First, the label &lsquo;terror suspects&rsquo;, although frequently employed by security agencies, is increasingly nebulous and ill-defined.&rdquo;He said authorities and police are prejudiced against certain communities and cannot be objective.Khalid said failure to offer just and legal means of redress for victims and their families leaves them vulnerable to recruitment by terror groups, which are quick to offer solace to victims of perceived state excesses.&ldquo;Coastal communities are increasingly caught between two fires &mdash; the violence meted out indiscriminately by security agencies and the threat of extremists against those who don&rsquo;t share their views,&rdquo; he said.Independent Police Oversight Authority chairman Macharia Njerureceived the report and called the casesreal and serious.&ldquo;Police must become professional and increase community engagement. It&rsquo;s not enough to say lofty things on police transformation, while actions speak the contrary. The tone to stop extralegal means in dealing with insecurity should be set by top police command if we are to end this culture of collective punishment and violation of law,&rdquo; he said.However, commissioner Murshid Abdalla of the National Police Service, defended police, saying the cases were isolated, involving individuals.He said the cases were not rampant, systematic and sanctioned by top security officials, as alleged by rights human rights groups.Abdalla did not say, however, what specific measures have been put in place to investigate suspicious cases and hold to account criminal indiv iduals.&ldquo;If you want to go the route of a debating society, I wont be part of it,&rdquo; he said.In 2014, the Independent Medico-Legal Unit recorded 199 cases of extrajudicial killings, and 97 by October 2015, including 85 summary executions by police and Kenya Wildlife Service officers. KNHCR and Human Rights Watch have also released detailed reports on extrajudicial killings.
