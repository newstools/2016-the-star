The Senate is to be commended for debating the Elections Laws (Amendments) Act and other laws in a sober and dignified manner yesterday. This was in complete contrast to MPs&rsquo; misconduct when they passed the amendments on Thursday last week. The senators held their special sitting with maximum mutual respect in a spirit of give-and-take debate. They reasoned together and did so graciously, including with laughter and humour. The senators&rsquo; intent was to argue, persuade and convince. The political divide remained in place as intractably as ever, but everyone was civil and emerged with dignity intact. As Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro observed at one point in this eminently civilised special sitting, the senators did not convene in the Chamber to fight. He repeated the old bromide about the Minority having their say and the Majority their way.Calm, cool and collected debate is indeed possible in the Houses of Parliament. Someone please tell that to the rowdy MPs of the 11th Parliament.
