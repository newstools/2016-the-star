The Maasai community living along the Standard Gauge Railway have accused the Chinese workers at the site of being disrespectful to them.They revealed this as the reasons they beat 14 of the Chinese workers during a clash in August.Speaking last Thursday during a stormy public hearing at Mai Mahiu, the community said it was 'disrespectful for Chinese to invade their land speaking to them in a strange language'. "We have never been involved in the construction of the railway. We only found the dictatorial workers who invaded our piece of land without our knowledge," Elijah Ole Koilel from Duka Moja said.Koilel claimed that some of the Chinese workers have tendencies of slapping them, a move he said is 'culturally not allowed among the Maasai'.On August 2, 14 Chinese workers were attacked by angry youths at the Duka Moja railway construction site in Narok county.Read: SGR&rsquo;s Chinese workers attacked on site by Maasais Over 200 sword-wielding youth descended on the workers demanding a share of SGR construction jobs in the area at that time.The community, at the recent meeting, demanded that they be given jobs beyond the employment of two young men hired as a link between the Chinese workers and the Maasai.The community demanded hefty compensation for their traditional houses, popularly known as Manyattas, saying they are unique and not found anywhere."Our houses are very expensive unlike the ones that use stone and cement. This is because we use our own manpower to construct them," Koilel said.Read: Kajiado residents protest SGR route through Nairobi national parkThe community also wants their 'expensively constructed water pans' respected when the SGR line will pass through the area.Suswa ward MCA hopeful Murungaru Mututwa said some members of the community that has supplied the contractors with building materials have not been paid.Mututwa cautioned the contractors against blocking some of the access roads saying the move will be rejected by the community.Lack of participation by the local community, job discrimination, lack of a clear plan on compensation and language barrier are among the sticky issues that cropped up. Kenya Railways MD Atanas Maina, National Environment Management Authority director general Geoffrey Wahungu sat pensively as community tore into them.Others who attended the highly charged meeting, held under tight security, was Naivasha deputy county commissioner Isaac Masinde and Nakuru county commissioner Joshua Nkanata.Maina said that they will tour the area, together with National Land Commission, next month to see how to the issues raised at the meeting can be addressed. It emerged that most land owners in the area do not have title deeds for their parcels.
