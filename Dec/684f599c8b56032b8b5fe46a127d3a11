The High Court has terminated fraud charges against former senior managers of the Geothermal Development Corporation.They were accused of inflating rig moving costs. Justice George Odunga stopped the Director of Public Prosecutions from prosecuting or continuing with the trial of the suspects, saying there was nothing in court to justify the case.Nicholas Karume, Abraham Kipchirhir, Peter Ayodo, Godwin Mwagae , Caleb Indiatsi , Bruno Mugambi and Michael Maingi, who were members of the GDC tender committee, were charged with illegally awarding a Sh42.7 million tender for rig moving services to Bonfide Clearing and Forwarding Ltd.However, they moved to the High Court and sought to block their prosecution on grounds that the charges were preferred against them out of malice. Giving them a new lease of life, justice Odunga faulted the DPP&rsquo;s office and that of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for failing to adduce enough evidence to prove why the trial should proceed.&ldquo;While this is not the forum to determine the applicants&rsquo; innocence or culpability, the DPP owes this court a duty of placing material upon which this court can feel that he is justified in mounting the prosecution,&rdquo; he said.Odunga (pictured) said he found merit in the arguments by the former officials and was of the view that their trial was unreasonable. He said it would not be permissible to allow the seven to face charges simply because they will have an opportunity to defend themselves.
