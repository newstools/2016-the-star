A subclan from Senator Yussuf Haji&rsquo;s Abdallah clan has urged him to retire from active politics and hand the mantle to his younger brother.Haji, a powerful and respected elder and administrator, is 76 years old.Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, the elders, led by Yussuf Abdi from the Baha subclan, said they have endorsed Rtd Major General Bashir Yussuf for governor.Abdi said Haji should join his clan elders in charting the community&rsquo;s political way forward. He dismissed a committee, which he accused of &ldquo;masquerading&rdquo; in Nairobi and purportedly championing the Abdallah clan.Abdi Noor, speaking on behalf of the youth, said the senator is no longer active in politics due to his old age and should honourably retire. &ldquo;Although political seats should not be hereditary, we want his younger brother to vie for the governor&rsquo;s seat,&rdquo; he said. Haji, a long-time career administrator, rose from a DO to PC during President Daniel Moi&rsquo;s administration. He served as nominated MP for one term, elected twice as Ijara MP and now serves as Garissa senator.Haji has hinted at defending his seat in the elections.Political analyst Abdi Mohamed said the Senate seat is Haji&rsquo;s and it would be difficult to defeat him.Haji is a respected elder and a long-serving provincial administrator. He was also a minister in President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s government, a respected figure in Garissa and he commands respect from the clans and subclans.Observers say the seat might not have attracted candidates because it is perceived to be Haji&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Defeating Haji is one huge task that nobody can do at the moment. As long as he vies, he will easily win it, thanks to the respect he commands across all communities living in Garissa,&rdquo; one observer said.
