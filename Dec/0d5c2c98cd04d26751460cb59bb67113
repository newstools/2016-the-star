Kenyans have expressed mixed feelings about opposition leader Raila Odinga in a poll conducted by the Star that ranks Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i as Person of the Year.Raila was ranked most controversial personality, most trusted person and the person with the most negative impact on respondents&rsquo; lives.The poll shows that Raila is Most Trusted Person at 23 per cent, followed by President Uhuru Kenyatta at 18 per cent and Matiang&rsquo;i at 14 per cent.Interestingly, when respondents are asked about Least Trusted Person, they rank Raila at second place (21 per cent) behind Deputy President William Ruto at 23 per cent.For Person With the Most Negative Impact, Raila leads at 23 per cent, followed by Ruto at 17 per cent and Uhuru at 15 per cent.In the Most Controversial category, Raila leads at 18 per cent, followed by Ruto at 17 per cent and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria at 15 per cent.Throughout 2016, Raila has been on Uhuru's case as the lead opposition leader, sometimes times attracting the President&rsquo;s wrath.Raila has painted Uhuru and Ruto as failed leaders who lead a corrupt government and he made many claims of impropriety.One of the most controversial moments in 2016 was during the burial of former Minister William Ntimama, when Raila refused to stand up as the President returned from the lectern to his chair on the podium, following a dressing down by Uhuru. The rest of the gathering remained standing until the President resumed his seat.Raila has also recently pitted Uhuru and Ruto supporters against him, with claims that two dams &ndash; one in Murang&rsquo;a and the other in the Mau &ndash; are corrupt schemes aimed at benefitting top Jubilee politicians.Matiang&rsquo;i, who has been widely praised for reforms in the education sector, tops the list of Personality of the Year with 24 per cent and is Best Performing Cabinet Secretary at 90 per cent.In August, the opposition called for Matiang&rsquo;i&rsquo;s resignation as a wave of arson incidents swept various schools across the country.At the time, Matiang'i had just kicked off various reforms in the education sector that were widely opposed, mainly by teachers.The changes included an overhaul of the Kenya National Examinations Council, which he said was controlled by cartels that made exam cheating easy.After the release of the KCPE results at the beginning of December, Matiang'i received much praise for the lack of cheating.A similar reaction has met the release of the KCSE results this week, where no exams were cancelled and the reforms appeared to pay off as no cheating was reported.The number of top students who score straight As drastically declined from over 2,000 to just 141, with the number of those with low grades rising dramatically.Uhuru comes in second as Personality of the Year (16 per cent), followed by Raila at 14 per cent.Matiang&rsquo;i is also ranked as Role Model of the Year (15 per cent), followed by Uhuru (12 per cent) while First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Raila and Ruto follow at three per cent each.The second best performing CS, according to the poll, is Foreign CS Amina Mohamed at five per cent, followed by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery at two per cent.Despite having resigned from the Cabinet in 2015, former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru is ranked as Worst Performing Minister for 2016 at 17 per cent.Waiguru resigned at the height of the NYS scandal, as calls for her to take responsibility for the massive theft heightened in December 2015.She said that her doctors had asked her to move away from the pressure and urged the President to grant her &ldquo;lighter duties.&rdquo;When no lighter duties were forthcoming, Waiguru plunged herself into politics and declared that she will seek the Jubilee Party ticket to run for Kirinyaga Governor.Health CS Cleopa Mailu and his Sports counterpart Hassan Wario are ranked as the second worst ministers at 15 per cent.Mailu has barely been at the Health ministry for a year, but was at the centre of attention as Afya House was alleged to have misappropriated billions of shillings.Wario has been on the spot over the mishandling of the Kenyan team to the Rio Olympic Games.At least 16 per cent of respondents say Uhuru is Best-dressed Male Personality, followed by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho (12 per cent) and US President Barack Obama (5 per cent).First Lady Margaret Kenyatta leads the list of best-dressed females of 2016, at 33 per cent, with 15 per cent of respondents saying their wives come in second.In the list of Top Blunders of the Year, the NYS scandal tops at 15.7 per cent followed by 'rampant corruption' (12 per cent) and the Naivasha Accident (8.3 per cent).The Uber taxi service is ranked Best Innovation of 2016, followed by the government's eCitizen system and Equity Bank's Equitel.David Rudisha (23 per cent) is Best Sportsman of the Year and Vivian Cheruiyot (28 per cent) is Best Sportswoman of the Year.Classic 105's morning show host Maina Kageni is ranked Best Radio Presenter while Citizen TV's Hussein Mohammed is Best TV Personality.
