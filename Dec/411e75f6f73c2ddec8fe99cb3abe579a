Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has described President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jamhuri Day speech as 'boring recitation of Jubilee failures'.In a statement on Monday, Mudavadi said the President confirmed he believes in the deceitful 'we have set aside' Jubilee development philosophy that is used by his government to hide incompetence and dupe Kenyans."I listened to the president&rsquo;s speech with shock...where figures in billions of shillings were mentioned...poor Kenyans don&rsquo;t see or feel what these billions do, but know they go into feeding the ogre of corruption," Mudavadi said.Read: President Uhuru Kenyatta's speech during 53rd Jamhuri Day celebrationsMudavadi said the President ignored corruption issues, among them the NYS scandal, during his speech. "I expected the president to personally disavow corruption. But true to character of having washed his hands off the fight against corruption, he virtually avoided its mention. Not strangely, he said the theft at NYS was a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; that has instead helped NYS achievements."The former Vice President also questioned why the President failed to mention two jubilee flagship projects, the 'flopped free laptops (vaguely called digital devices now) and stuttering SGR. "His evasion was a clear indication we will soon be saddled with a white elephant SGR railway, incomplete, inviable and uneconomical," Mudavadi said.
