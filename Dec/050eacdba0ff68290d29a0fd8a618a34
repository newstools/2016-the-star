Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop the culture of stealing elections in the country.Kalonzo said the efforts being made by Jubilee to amend the election laws are an indication that they intend to rig the 2017 elections. "I did wrong to join Kibaki (President Mwai Kibaki) in 2007 and the same team repeated the stealing in 2013 after my good friend Raila Amollo Odinga won," said Kalonzo.Kalonzo said leaders who interfere with the electoral process end up serving personal interests. "We should stop thinking on tribal lines to help a few people looting our economy. Someone who steals an election will also steal your taxes," he said.The CORD co principal said the issues affecting Kenyans are the same irrespective of tribe, class and gender since all citizens shared the facilities and equally paid taxes to the national government.&ldquo;Elections are stolen because a few people don&rsquo;t accept the will of the people. The more they steal,the more we will see our resources swindled by those in power,&rdquo; Kalonzo stated.Read: Jubilee plans to rig 2017 polls - RailaHe added that the government should respect the will of Kenyans so that the country can effectively grow.&ldquo;When we take over the government we will make sure people stop politics of deceit," said Kalonzo.Kalonzo dismissed the Ipsos poll saying it was created to set the Jubilee propaganda towards the next elections.&ldquo;I really wonder if the person who was conducting the research understood what Kenyans are going through and even interviewed any Kenyan,&rdquo; said Kalonzo.He added Uhuru was in a position to ensure free and fair elections in the country to stop tribalism and bad governance.&ldquo;I have been in politics for a long time and I know those people who are honest and those who are not honest. Uhuru and Ruto are not honest with Kenyans. They are not supposed to lead this country,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.Read: Uhuru most popular Presidential aspirant, half of Kenyans will vote for him - IPSOSKalonzo was speaking at a Nairobi hotel after he launched his memoir-Against all Odds.Speaking at the same event Cord Co Principal Moses Wetangula said the Senate had contacted the Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) who stated the digital process of voting is achievable."We were told that with the satellite phones its achievable.
