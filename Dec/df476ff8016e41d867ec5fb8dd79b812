The Garissa government has rejected projects proposed by the Equalisation Fund board. It said they are duplications of projects already in the County Integrated Development Plan.County secretary Mohamud Mursal said the administration was not consulted about the proposed projects and how funds allocated will be spent. He spoke on Thursday during a public participation meeting on how to spend Sh764 million from the fund&ldquo;We know where the pain is. Some of these projects are not a priority to our people. We are not in agreement with these proposals because they are not in line with our integrated development plan,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Until we sit down and consult the board and the leadership in the National Assembly, we cannot allow the proposed projects to go ahead.&rdquo;Dadaab MP Mohamed Dahiye said the funds should be allocated through the national government&rsquo;s line ministries.&ldquo;We believe that if this money comes through the national government, we shall get value for money. That will be more efficient, faster and they will be able to deliver quality work,&rdquo; he said. Dahiye said area MPs have come up with proposals that allocate the funds to water, road, health and energy. He said all the constituencies will benefit from the money.
