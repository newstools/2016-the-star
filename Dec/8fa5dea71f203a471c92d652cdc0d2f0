Album: 4 Your Eyez OnlyArtiste: J ColeGenre: Hip hopRelease: December 3, 2016J Cole has done it yet again with the release of his 10-track album "4 Your Eyez Only". The album is deep on Cole's experiences, which he carefully narrates through the effort. The album comprises significant tracks, such as Immortal, Ville Mentality, Change, Neighbours and 4 Your Eyez Only. Again, just like his previous album, "2014 Forest Hills Drive," the album has zero features. Cole continues to demonstrate his lyrical worth and expertise. This effort is definitely one of his best efforts.Star Rating: 4 out of 5
