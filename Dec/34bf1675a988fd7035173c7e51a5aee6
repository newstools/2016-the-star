DP William Ruto was yet again dragged into Jacob Juma s murder after a suspect claiming to be his employee yesterday sensationally linked his office to the assassination.The police obtained court orders to continue holding Douglas Nyakundi for four days so they can investigate the latest twist in murder of the anti-government and anti-Ruto whistleblower.The suspect, according to an affidavit filed in court yesterday, is said to have delivered to rights activist Boniface Mwangi a letter containing a confession on how Juma s murder was planned and executed. The man, claiming to be a spy and a messenger in the office of the DP, told Mwangi he had been sent by his boss, identified only as Mr Rono, to deliver the sensational letter to him.The letter titled Self confession , the court heard, contains names of the people believed to have had a hand in the May 5 assassination. Juma s body was found in his car outside outside Lenana School. Nyakundi appeared before senior principal magistrate Teresa Nyangena. He was arrested on November 30 and will remain in custody at the Kilimani police station at police request. Investigators told the court Nyakundi demanded the activist deposit an unspecified sum in his bank account so his boss Rono could reveal more details. He would also provide adossier to assist Mwangi in the defamation case filed against him by the DP, the court was told.Nyakundi also said Rono has credible information Mwangi could be murdered in a stage-managed traffic accident.DCI officer Philip Mwangi requested 14 more day to determine the veracity of the letter and if indeed the two men work at the DP s office.The officer said Mwangi recorded his conversation with Nyakundi.
