Has the Jubilee presidential campaign team from a county in the Nyanza region run into headwinds amid accusations of involvement in beauty pageants? We are told that the team put together to spearhead President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s (pictured) reelection strategy in the expansive region has found itself in uncharted waters. With the highly dynamic political landscape of the area and the community, the team may have shot itself in the foot. A youth wing which was to be recruited is comprised of non-starters. Word has it that some of the young people in the team were offered huge sums of money to join the Jubilee campaign while others were involved in &lsquo;bedroom consultations&rsquo; to secure their places. Corridors is aware that some of the officials have placed their mistresses into the crucial role, a fact that may jeopardise the team&rsquo;s integrity and technical capacity to deliver results, eight months to the polls in an Opposition epicentre. ************A governor from the Coast is a man under siege. Reason? His opponents are giving him sleepless nights and he has been forced to roll out a whirlwind programme of rallies across the county, almost on a daily basis, defending his &lsquo;poor&rsquo; track record under a barrage of criticism. While the residents have questioned the governor&rsquo;s source of funding for the high-flying political events that have become the hallmark of the region&rsquo;s campaigning, his opponents have fired a salvo at the county boss and accused him of misuse of public money to finance the rallies. &ldquo;We are wondering if the governor does go to his office. He is busy in political rallies from Sunday through Saturday. Isn&rsquo;t he using public funds to fund these rallies?&rdquo; One of the MPs from the region, who is seeking to unseat the flamboyant county boss, was overheard complaining at Parliament Buildings last week.************ A senior ODM operative from Nyanza, who sits in the party&rsquo;s National Executive Council, has been shamelessly collecting hundreds of thousands from vulnerable aspirants from the region with a promise that he will secure them party tickets at the 2017 general election. What the senior Orange party official doesn&rsquo;t know is that opponents who have gotten wind of the behind-the-scenes manoeuvres have petitioned party leader Raila Odinga to stop the scheme. The disgruntled aspirants want Raila to rein in the Orange House officials to avert bungled nominations that will kill his campaign momentum in the epic Presidential duel. The official was initially collecting millions from aspirants as &ldquo;appearance fees&rdquo; during political rallies, harambees or funerals to shape voters&rsquo; opinions regarding the hopefuls.
