This year, all indications are that the thorny issue of cheating in primary and secondary school national exams has been addressed.And, as a bonus, the results are expected early.To give credit where it is due, Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i walked the talk and personally oversaw the measures that were implemented to curb cheating at the exam sitting stage, as well as at the marking stage.Thus Kenyans should therefore listen when Dr Matiang&rsquo;i proposes that county commissioners should chair County Education Boards.The support the ministry got from the county commissioners and police helped make this year's exams a success. An inter-agency team from the ministries of Education, ICT and Interior and Coordination of National Government worked seamlessly to deliver enviable results.It is worth relooking at the aspects of the Constitution that transferred the responsibility of school management to the devolved units.The outcomes before this year were far from successful. The momentum of reforms in the education sector must be maintained.
