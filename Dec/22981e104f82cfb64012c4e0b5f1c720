A lawyer has petitioned Chief Justice David Maraga following orders that all corruption cases be heard at a centralised court in Nairobi.Former LSK CEO Apollo Mboya wants Maraga to "be found guilty of misconduct and misbehaviour incompatible with the status of a chief justice".The accusations of gross misconduct have been levied when the CJ is barely three months in office.Mboya believes the CJ breached the constitution, adding that hearing cases at the anti-corruption court will inconveniencing litigants.The lawyer argues that the order, in effect, strips other High Courts across the country of their powers to deal with corruption cases and judicial review matters."With the practice directions the chief justice has purported to strip jurisdictional powers from other high court judges and increased the cost of litigation on account of travelling to Nairobi and hindered expeditious access to justice," says Mboya.
