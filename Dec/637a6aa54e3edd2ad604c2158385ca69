A majority of MPs from Kakamega county will not attend the ceremony to name a Luhya spokesperson on Saturday.The function to be held in Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega town, has been convened by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.MPs Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Andrew Toboso (Butere), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Malulu Injendi (Malava), David Were (Matungu) and Benjamin Andola of Khwisero have said they were not consulted and are not aware of the agenda of the meeting.Speaking separately to the Star, the lawmakers criticised the Cotu boss for sidelining them in identifying the community spokesperson.&ldquo;The Luhya nation is bigger than one person. Atwoli should have consulted other leaders from the region before settling on a candidate of his choice. We cannot blindly follow his leader of choice,&rdquo; Washiali said.Wangwe said Atwoli has always supported the opposition and is &ldquo;hell-bent&rdquo; to pick the community&rsquo;s spokesperson from among his friends in the opposition.&ldquo;What this community requires is a focused, non-partisan person, full of wisdom and who can address issues of the community without political interests. We are afraid Atwoli will impose on us one of his friends from the opposition side,&rdquo; Wangwe said.Were said Atwoli does not mingle freely with the Luhya people and does not know the best person to be the community&rsquo;s spokesperson. &ldquo;I reserve a lot of respect to my brother and good friend Atwoli. But this is a hefty issue that surpasses him as an individual&rdquo; he said.Lugari MP Ayub Savula, however, confirmed his attendance. &ldquo;The decision by Atwoli should be followed by all Luhyas and the entire Western. It is for the good of all the people of Western region,&rdquo; he said.
