A lobby group wants Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and his Interior Security counterpart Joseph Nkaissery punished for failing to gazette the contentious Public Benefits Organisation Act.Kiunjuri was in October ordered by the court to gazette the PBO Act 2013 within 14 days, but he is yet to do so.The CS recently said his hands are tied over the issue, because the NGO sector has been transferred to the Interior ministry and he cannot set and gazette the date of entry into force of the PBO Act as ordered by the court. Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance, a lobby group which has been pushing for the enactment of the law for close to four years, in the new suit wants the court to order Kiunjuri and Attorney General Githu Muigai to comply with the court order.The lobby says the transfer of the NGO sector was meant to circumvent the orders and frustrate the implementation of the decision of the court.Through lawyer Julie Soweto, the group says the duration in which the CS was to appoint the PBO Act has lapsed and there is no way the orders can be rendered impotent or nullified by an alleged administrative transfer. &ldquo;Without prejudice to the foregoing and the application filed herewith the alleged transfer of function is a deliberate attempt to circumvent the orders of the court and to frustrate the implementation of the decision of the court&rdquo; the lobby states in its court papers.It says Kiunjuri and Nkaissery deliberately disobeyed the court.The lobby says it is in the interest of justice and for the protection of the constitution and the integrity of the court that the minister be ordered to comply.
