CS Eugene Wamalwa has said the government will spend more than Sh5 billion to revive key stalled irrigation projects along River Galana and in Kibwezi from March next year.He said on Thursday the funds will be allocated to two key irrigation projects in Madunguni and Kibwezi to boost irrigation and reduce food shortage.He said all community irrigation projects along the rivers Galana-Sabaki line will be revived to enable the community to carry out small-scale farming.Wamalwa said the aim of reviving the projects is to supplement the one million-acre food security project in Galana Kulalu. He said the 10,000-acre test farm in Galana-Kulalu has been successful, producing 39 bags of maize per acre and set to be complete by March next year.Wamalwa spoke when he toured stalled projects in Madunguni and other community projects in Mongotini, Kakoneni, Langobaya and Chakama in Malindi constituency. The CS was invited by his Mining counterpart Dan Kazungu to inspect the stalled projects and look for ways of reviving them. Wamalwa said the region has the potential to end perennial hunger because of its rich soil.&ldquo;Research was done in this area and has proved there is rich soil similar to that of Kitale in my home county,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, adding that after March next year, focus will be shifted towards small irrigation projects to ensure residents get an opportunity to irrigate their farms, instead of relying only on the Galana-Kulalu project.At the Madunguni irrigation scheme, he said the designs are complete for irrigation on 10,000 acres. The same, he said, will be implemented in the Kibwezi irrigation project. &ldquo;A lot of water from the Galana River is going to waste. The ocean does not need it. It&rsquo;s you, the people, who can use it to uplift your living standards,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
