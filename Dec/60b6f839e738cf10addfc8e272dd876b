Two MPs who sat for the 2016 KCSE exams at Acacia Adult Education Center in Eldoret scored B+, the director of the centre where they were registered for the tests said on Friday.Benjamin Cheboi, who declined to reveal the names of the MPs saying the legislators had requested to remain anonymous, said the other two from Uasin Gishu scored C+ and C plain respectively.One of those who scored B+ is from Bungoma while the other is from Baringo.Cheboi said the legislators sat for the papers at Eldoret Central Primary School and at a private centre in Baringo."We are talking to them so that they can accept to go public about the exams and use the experience to encourage other Kenyans to take up education seriously regardless of their age. They should inspire others outside there," he said.Read: KCSE 2016 results: Over 183,200 candidates to miss university slots after scoring 'D-', 'E'Also read: Joy as Kisumu slum boy scores 'A' in KCSE, cites determinationCheboi said his school had 25 special candidates from which the best scored an 'A' with 83 points, while the rest got above C+.He said he had been training the MPs and several MCAs, all of whom were among more than 20 prominent personalities and senior government officials who sat for the KCSE exams in Eldoret last year."We are very happy with the achievement and we hope to help more Kenyans go back to class because it&rsquo;s never too late to get education in life," he said.At the same time, Kapsabet Boys and Moi Girls High School were among the best performing schools in the North Rift producing some of the top candidates countrywide.
