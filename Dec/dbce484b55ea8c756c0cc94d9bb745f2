Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan (pictured) yesterday termed &ldquo;disgusting and unfortunate&rdquo; an incident in which some doctors&rsquo; union officials were chased and roughed up by goons while meeting county representatives on Wednesday. He exonerated the national officials of any wrongdoing, saying they can meet anywhere. He wants police to launch investigations.
