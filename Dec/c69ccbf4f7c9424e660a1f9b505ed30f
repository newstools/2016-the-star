The National Treasury has defended the Integrated Financial Management Information System saying it provides audit trails of transactions for the national and county governments.IFMIS director Jerome Ochieng said the system has a complex structure that is designed to safeguard financial malpractice, making it impossible for any procuring entity to approve a transaction unnoticed.&ldquo;IFMIS approval hierarchy ensures security, accountability, checks and balances and leaves audit trail at each point of action. The system provides audit trails of all financial transactions including details of persons who logged in, the time, the computer used and the action performed for each transaction,&rdquo; he said.Ochieng said the set protocols are meant to ensure that a transaction is approved by the respective designated officers at all validation levels.&ldquo;The system also retains information on the identities of all the officers involved in processing and approving the transactions from the point of requisition, validation, approval and payment including the beneficiary bank accounts into which the funds were paid,&rdquo; he said.
