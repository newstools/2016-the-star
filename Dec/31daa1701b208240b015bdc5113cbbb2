Yahya Jammeh, The Gambia's authoritarian president of 22 years, has suffered a surprise defeat in the country's general election.He will be replaced by a property developer, Adama Barrow, who won more than 45% of the vote.Jammeh, who came to power in a coup in 1994, has conceded, said electoral commission chief Alieu Momar Njie.Before announcing the final result, Njie appealed for calm as the country entered unchartered waters.The Gambia has not had a smooth transfer of power since independence in 1965.Barrow won 263,515 votes (45.5 per cent) in Thursday's election, while President Jammeh took 212,099 (36.7 per cent), according to the electoral commission. A third party candidate, Mama Kandeh, won 102,969 (17.8 per cent)."There will be celebrations, there will be a disappointment, but we all know we are all Gambia," Njie said, after announcing the results on Friday.President Jammeh's defeat comes as a huge surprise.Despite a surge of support for an opposition broadly united behind one candidate, most people expected the status quo to prevail.Former businessman Adama Barrow now has his chance to tackle the poverty and unemployment which drives so many young Gambians to join the Mediterranean migrant trail every year.A devout Muslim, Jammeh, 51, once said he would rule for "one billion years" if "Allah willed it"."It's really unique that someone who has been ruling this country for so long has accepted defeat," Njie, the electoral commission chief, told reporters.Jammeh seized power in a bloodless coup 22 years ago and has ruled the country with an iron fist ever since.Human rights groups have accused Jammeh, who has in the past claimed he can cure Aids and infertility, of repression and abuses of the media, the opposition and gay people.In 2014, he called homosexuals "vermin" and said the government would deal with them as it would malaria-carrying mosquitoes.Several previous opposition leaders were imprisoned after taking part in a rare protest in April.Barrow has previously described him a "soulless dictator" and promised to undo some of Jammeh's more controversial moves, including reversing decisions to remove The Gambia from the Commonwealth and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Was the election fair?Celebrations erupted in the capital, Banjul, with Gambians shouting: "We are free. We won't be slaves of anyone."During the campaign, the country's mostly young population seemed to be yearning for change, said the BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Banjul.On voting day the internet and international phone calls were banned across the country.
