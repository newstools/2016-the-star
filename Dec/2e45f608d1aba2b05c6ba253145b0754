In an obscene Facebook post, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has threatened to insert a broken bottle into Mbita lawmaker Millie Odhiambo for insulting the President.On his official Facebook account, Kuria on Tuesday night castigated Odhiambo for calling Uhuru Kenyatta &ldquo;a fake President&rdquo; who rigged the last election. Kuria, notorious for offensive comments, said Odhiambo had &ldquo;crossed the red line&rdquo; and told her to &ldquo;keep off Parliament.&rdquo;He posted in English, &ldquo;You have pushed our patience to the end. Last year you got your way through removing your smelly panties to suffocate us with the repugnant stench of your maggot-infested things.&rdquo;Kuria went on, &ldquo;Today you have crossed the red line disrespecting the lawful authority of the land. Now no one will have a reason to blame me. Keep away from Parliament. I will insert a broken beer [bottle] deep down that Mbita stinking chieth.&rdquo;On Tuesday, Odhiambo said, &ldquo;Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is a fake President, as his own backyard is poor. We have come here prepared for death and we are going to Canaan, not back to Egypt.&rdquo;Kuria criticised ODM for temporarily blocking controversial amendments to the new election laws in a tumultuous session on Tuesday night. ODM says the changes will weaken election laws and allow Jubilee to rig the polls. Efforts to reach Kuria for comment on his post were unsuccessful.
