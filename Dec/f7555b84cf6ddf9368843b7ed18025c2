Tobacco use and poor diet are the leading risk factors for cancer and other non-communicable diseases in Kenya, a new report by the World Health Organisation shows.The report says although alcohol is also a risk factor, most people are not regular drinkers but only fall into heavy episodic drinking. The report consolidates available data from more than 20 countries across Africa to identify the main causes of the rising burden of cancer, diabetes, heart diseases and other NCDs.The burden from these illnesses will likely surpass the toll of sickness and death from infectious diseases by 2030, WHO says.&ldquo;These are diseases that can be life-threatening as well as debilitating, and they place a significant hardship on the region, robbing people and families of those who otherwise should be enjoying their most productive years,&rdquo; said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO&rsquo;s Regional Director for Africa.The Report on the status of major health risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, WHO African Region, 2015 says people can prevent the diseases by avoiding tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, a poor diet (not consuming five servings of fruits and vegetables daily), and low levels of physical activity.Most of the adults developing these diseases are women between the ages of 45-64. The prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, in Africa is the highest worldwide, affecting an estimated 46 per cent of adults, the report said.&ldquo;High blood pressure can damage the heart, leading to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and fatty buildup in the arteries, causing them to harden. It also can contribute to stroke, kidney damage and vision loss, among other things,&rdquo; said Dr Abdikamal Alisalad, acting Director of WHO&rsquo;s NCD cluster.
