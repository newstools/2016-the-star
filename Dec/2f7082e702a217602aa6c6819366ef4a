Preach peace in the streets, at public meetings, in homes and at every opportunity, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi urged religious leaders yesterday. He said Kenya will grow by leaps and bounds when everyone stands together as one, irrespective of religion, tribe or any other differences. Wamatangi spoke in Kiambu. &ldquo;Unity is paramount and religious leaders should be at the forefront, especially now that we are heading to the polls. Peace should be preached and upheld at all costs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unity holds a family and nation together in good and bad times.&rdquo; Wamatangi said religious leaders have to give voice to public discontent over corruption, but discourage people from turning to violence to vent their ire. Wamatangi said religious leaders should not sway Kenyans in a certain political direction, but allow them to make their own decisions. Wamatangi defended the Jubilee government&rsquo;s effort to fight corruption. &ldquo;Individuals must carry their own cross in the fight against corruption, and not make it a communal responsibility. Individuals who steal are not doing so for Jubilee but are out to enrich themselves and their kin,&rdquo; he said. Wamatangi urged the campaign teams appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to head his reelection bid to be inclusive. &rdquo;... we need everybody on board to make sure the President and his deputy are reelected.&rdquo;
