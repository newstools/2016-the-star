Hundreds of patients are stranded at the Malindi Subcounty Hospital after doctors and nurses went on strike yesterday, calling for a pay hike and promotions.Many others were forced to seek medical attention in private hospitals.The emergency and maternity units were most affected as doctors and health staff directed patients to go home. Patience Menza, 22, delivered on Sunday night through a Caesarean Section. She was forcefully discharged after medical personnel said they could not attend to her.The strike was called to push for the implementation of a Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2003.When journalists arrived at the maternity wing at Malindi Subcounty Hospital, she had received her discharge letter and was walking out. Menza sought medical attention at Tawfiq Private Hospital in Malindi town. Some who arrived in the morning in critical condition were turned down, including an accident victim who had been knocked down by a Nairobi-bound bus on the Malindi-Mombasa highway.The situation was worse for patients in critical condition who could not afford the high costs in private hospitals.
