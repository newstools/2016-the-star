Deputy President William Ruto on Friday presided over three fundraisers in Kakamega County.The tight schedule by the DP could be seen as a rush to beat the Wednesday deadline when Election Laws bar politicians from participating in such events.The DP started at Khayega primary school in Shinyalu constituency where he donated Sh1million before moving to Ikonyero in Lurambi where he donated another Sh1million and similar amount for President Uhuru Kenyatta.He promised to wire another Sh3m to the school for construction of a tuition block.He attended the third fundraiser at Shianda market in Mumias East before flying to Budalangi for a separate function.Read: DP William Ruto gives Sh17m in two monthsPoliticians who dish out money in fundraisers from next week risk being barred from running in the next general election.The Act bars politicians from participating in a fundraising event or making other contributions including for the sick, eight months before an election.
