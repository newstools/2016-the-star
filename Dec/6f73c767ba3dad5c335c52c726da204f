One of five IEBC chairperson hopefuls dropped out of contention yesterday in favour of younger applicants, especially women. Lawyer David Mereka, 64, surprised the seven-member selection panel when he withdrew his candidature.Mereka told the panel chaired by Bernadette Musundi he is the oldest applicant, and wants to let &ldquo;younger, resourceful and brilliant&rdquo; candidates to serve. &ldquo;I have watched the interviews for the last two days. I have decided to withdraw my candidature on grounds of the two-thirds gender rule and to allow younger applicants to take charge of the next IEBC,&rdquo; Mureka said. Musundi praised Mureka and said one of the interview questions was to be how to achieve the two-thirds gender principle.The principle states that no more than two-thirds of any elected or appointed state panel shall be comprised of men or women.&ldquo;I hope my withdrawal will in a small way increase the chances of women among applicants to sail through and be part of the next IEBC,&rdquo; Mereka said. Two candidates &mdash; Roseline Odede and David Malakwen&rsquo;s &mdash; hopes to replace outgoing IEBC chairman Issack Hassan hang in the balance after it emerged they are being investigated. The Musundi-led panel did not disclose the cases but confirmed knowledge of the proceedings. &ldquo;Since this is still in court and on course, we don&rsquo;t want you to defend yourself. Also, we cannot discuss matters in court,&rdquo; Musundi said. Former TJRC commissioner Margret Ngugi disputed a petition opposing her oeer allegedly doctoring the commission report by removing names of prominent people. Three memoranda were filed to the panel by petitioners George Aladwa, Japheth Mutoko and Peter Otuoma.
