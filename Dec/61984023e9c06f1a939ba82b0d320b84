Majority leader in the National Assembly Aden Duale has alleged that opposition leader Raila Odinga is afraid of losing the 2017 general elections.Duale on Wednesday said that this is why the ODM leader is claiming there will be no election if the law on technology back up is passed."Raila is out to ensure that next year&rsquo;s election does not take place &ndash; push out electoral commissioners at the 11thhour, reject back up for technology so that the elections are messed up and incitement that is a lookalike to 2007," Duale said in a statement."It has been clear since 2014 that the ODM leader does not want an election because he knows he will lose next year as he did in 1997, 2007 and 2013. His violent crusade against the outgoing IEBC earlier in the year, and the ridiculous opposition to a back up to election technology tell the whole story," he stated.The Garissa township MP further alleged Raila wants a failed election so that he and 'his foreign masters' can push for a caretaker government, something that is undemocratic and stranger than fiction.This comes after ODM MPs on Tuesday managed to temporarily block controversial amendments to the election laws.The Opposition leader later accused Jubilee government of coercing opposition MPs to amend the election laws in parliament.He said the opposition MPs will not allow any amendment proposed by Jubilee side of parliament.
