The Public Accounts Committee has finally summoned Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen over the Sh1.8 billion NYS scandal.Sing&rsquo;oei Murkomen and Sigei Advocates, a law firm owned by Murkomen, received Sh15 million from Out of the Box Solutions linked to the NYS scandal.PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo said the committee met yesterday and collectively agreed to have the Senate deputy majority leader appear before it next Thursday to shed light on the matter.This is after the law firm failed to send written submissions to the committee by Wednesday, the deadline given by the watchdog committee.Gumbo however said Farouk Kibet, Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s aide, has forwarded his written submission to the committee regarding millions he recieved from NYS suspect Josephine Kabura under unclear circumstances.The committee will make a decision on whether to invite Kibet after analysing his submissions.Gumbo, in a statement to the House, sought the speaker&rsquo;s help in controlling members discussing the NYS probe outside the committee.He said the committee&rsquo;s investigations should not be raw material for political wars.&ldquo;We will not allow such debate to sway the decision of the committee,&rdquo; Gumbo said.Suba MP John Mbadi, a member of PAC, on Tuesday during a live TV interview said the committee has been compromised and will not deliver an objective probe.He also said the committee, particularly the chairman, was reluctant in summoning Murkomen and Kibet to appear before the committee.Mbadi had also written a letter to Gumbo asking him to summon the two over the &ldquo;morphing&rdquo; NYS scandal saying the decision to have them make written submissions was not collective.But yesterday, Gumbo said the decisions of the committee are made collectively by members and that Mbadi&rsquo;s letter was not in good faith.&ldquo;I wonder why a member of the committee with unfettered access to the committee wrote to me insinuating reluctance of the chairman to invite the pair to appear before the committee,&rdquo; Gumbo said in a letter to Mbadi and which he read to the House.Standing Order 86 requires MPs to desist from discussing matters under consideration by a committee of Parliament.
