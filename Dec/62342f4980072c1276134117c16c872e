Detectives from the Kenya Maritime Authorities are looking for the owner of the luxury sailing car that has been cruising in the Indian Ocean and ferrying holidaymakers on the Jomo Kenyatta public beach.According to information obtained by the Star, the Jeep weighs about 1.5 tonnes and is equipped with a 3.6-litre engine enabling it to cruise at 40 miles an hour on water. The car has wheels which turn into propellers when in water.Police sources said the owner, a foreigner, is an influential person and has been sailing without proper sailing documentation from any transport authority, including KMA.This is a danger to human and marine life, they say.&ldquo;The foreigner is so influential, rude and uses identities of some Mombasa prominent people in making his ends better. The car has no documentation for sailing,&rdquo; a source said.Acting KMA director general Cosmas Cherop said he has sent his officers to find out under which law the foreigner is operating.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s endangering human and marine life. We have never given licence to any sailing car in Kenya,&rdquo; he said.In 2012, Marc Witt built a prototype that can reach speeds of 125km per hour on land and 60 nautical miles in water.The Sea Lion was in competition with 25 other models to claim the title of the world&rsquo;s fastest vehicle capable of both operations. The local price of the car was estimated to be $259,900 (Sh26,641,569 ).The owner of the car did not talk to journalists.
