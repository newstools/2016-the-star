A nationwide boda boda safety training has been launched in Nakuru to reduce fatalities. Motorcycle assembler and distributor Yamaha Kenya partnered with the National Transport and Safety Authority and the Kenya Police Service to offer enhanced safety training for boda boda operators. &ldquo;Yamaha Riding Academy is set to be rolled out to other counties in 2017 through partnerships with county governments and Boda Boda Associations. It will train boda boda operators across the country,&rdquo; said Toyota Kenya MD Sachio Yotsukura. Nakuru county is the first to benefit from the training, with more than 20 boda boda operators being trained by the Yamaha Riding Academy. Nakuru Transport executive Maina Kairu said, &ldquo;Our county health facilities are stretched with an entire ward dedicated to injuries resulting from motorcycle accidents. We are working with boda boda associations to form co-operatives under which we train boda boda operators and develop a peer safety training system.&rdquo; Those trained today will pass on the knowledge to other boda boda operators, he said.
