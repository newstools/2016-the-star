Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero wants speaker Alex ole Magelo jailed for six months for defying a court order stopping his impeachment. He has also urged the court to fine Magelo and the clerk of the Nairobi City county assembly, Jacob Ngwele, Sh5 million each.Under a certificate of urgency, Kidero said it is clear that Magelo is aware of the existence of the order issued on October 11 by Justice Roselyn Aburili. He said despite the evident knowledge and service of the order, the respondents have willfully and in insubordination of the court's authority disobeyed the order. &ldquo;The respondents in their utter and blatant disobedience of the order have chosen to knowingly give the order a skewed interpretation that the court only suspended my summoning to appear before the county assembly on October 11 and not the impeachment process as it had contemplated,&rdquo; Kidero said.According to court documents, Magelo "in an act of disobedience" issued a communication on November 24 that stated the motion by MCA Samuel Nyangwara for the impeachment of Kidero be slotted for debate on November 29.The clerk then listed the motion in the assembly&rsquo;s order of business for debate on November 29 and December 1. Kidero said if the court does not move swiftly, he is going to be subjected to an illegal impeachment and the proceedings before court will be rendered irrelevant. After Kidero obtained the order stopping his impeachment, Magelo filed an application seeking to set it aside on grounds that it was obtained by material misrepresentation, concealment and non-disclosure of material facts.Magelo said Kidero misled the court that he issued summons to him to appear before the assembly while all the house did was to notify him of the motion brought against him
