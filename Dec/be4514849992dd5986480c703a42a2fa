Two people have moved to court to stop the election of new officials at the Kenya Judiciary Staff Association. Duncan Odima and Carolyne Opuka said association officials have purported to give a notice, which was insufficient, for the Saturday election.&ldquo;The officials illegally and unconstitutionally gave notice on November 19, intimating to the members of the association that an annual general meeting will be held on December 10 at a venue not yet designated to elect new officials,&rdquo; they said.The two said the notice does not comply with article 9 of the association&rsquo;s constitution, which requires that a 21-day notice be issued to all members.They said the association is focused on infringing on their rights and stopping other members from actively participating in the affairs and activities of the association.The two want the court to issue a temporary order stopping the elections until the court gives proper guidelines.
