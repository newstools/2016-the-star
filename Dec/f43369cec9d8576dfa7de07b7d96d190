The county governments fear that the two-day breakdown of the electronic payment system could ground operations.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya warned yesterday that the breakdown would affect processing and payment of staff salaries.Payments to vendors and suppliers of various services to the counties will also be affected as we approach the festive season, he said.Munya said it is not a good sign for the Integrated Financial Management Information System to break down, given the past problems of password mishandling and misappropriation of funds. He wants it restored.Ifmis is a computer system that processes procurement and payments for goods and services bought by national and county government agencies.&ldquo;Something sinister could be going on, yet it is the county leaders who will be blamed,&rdquo; Munya said.The system was meant to enhance financial accountability, but questions were raised over the loss of Sh791 million in National Youth Service funds.The scandal led to a number of government officials in the Devolution ministry and the NYS department quitting, including CS Anne Waiguru.Waiguru told the Public Accounts Committee that persons entering figures into the systems might have exaggerated them, while PS Peter Mangiti said the system is opaque.&ldquo;The county governments don&rsquo;t understand whether the system breakdown is by design or by default,&rdquo; Munya said.The current Ifmis technical failure has caused anxiety among vendors and suppliers expecting to be paid by national and county governments.A supplier called The Star yesterday to find out if it is true that Ifmis was out of order. &ldquo;Is it true that this system is not working? I expect payment from one of the ministries, but I&rsquo;m being told the system is not working,&rdquo; the caller said and added that his festive plans have been disrupted.The county governments have on many occasions blamed the e-procurement system for mishaps, arguing that they do not have personnel to operate it.Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, the CoG Finance chairman, was unavailable for comment.In 2015, Oparanya bemoaned the system&rsquo;s frequent breakdowns, weak internet connection and the lack of enough accountants that made it difficult for county governments to use the system. He said it made the counties &ldquo;unattractive to investors.&rdquo;The state at one point sent support staff to the counties, but the system continues to experience breakdowns to date.Leaders and other players have urged the state to revert to the manual system of procurement and payment.
