President Uhuru Kenyatta will this week receive the Rio report on the chaotic preparation and management of the Kenyan Olympics team.The 90-page report alleges Sh80 million was pocketed by organisers, sports kits stolen and joyriders included in the trip, despite this country producing its most successful team in the Olympics ever. I know there has been some expectation around this report, but it wasn t handed over to the President this week, State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said yesterday without giving reasons for the failure. We look forward to it being made available this week, so necessary actions can be taken and we put this episode behind us. The investigations were ordered in August by Sports CS Hassan Wario, following allegations of corruption at the National Olympic Committee of Kenya.
