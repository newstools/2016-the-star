President Uhuru Kenyatta will this week receive the Rio report on the chaotic preparation and management of the Kenyan Olympics team.The 90-page report alleges Sh80 million was pocketed by organisers, sports kits stolen and joyriders included in the trip, despite this country producing its most successful team in the Olympics ever.&ldquo;I know there has been some expectation around this report, but it wasn&rsquo;t handed over to the President this week,&rdquo; State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said yesterday without giving reasons for the failure. &ldquo;We look forward to it being made available this week, so necessary actions can be taken and we put this episode behind us.&rdquo;The investigations were ordered in August by Sports CS Hassan Wario, following allegations of corruption at the National Olympic Committee of Kenya.
