Strip clubs in Mombasa are now using underage girls to attract clients, the Kenya Film and Classification Board has said.CEO Ezekiel Mutua on Wednesday told Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki they have received numerous reports.Achoki said police will conduct a major swoop to rid all strip clubs of sexual predators and proprietors.Mutua, in a workshop with Muslim clerics at the School of Government in Mombasa, said some strip club proprietors take advantage of the poverty in some families to lure underage girls into the business.&ldquo;We have not yet verified the reports but we would like to bring the matter to the attention of the county commissioner,&rdquo; he said.Mutua said the commissioner has the necessary machinery at his disposal to conduct a quick probe and deal with the matter.&ldquo;We do not have prosecutorial powers but our investigations are at an advanced stage and once we find what we want, we will give all the information to you,&rdquo; he said.Some foreigners who ostensibly come to Mombasa for holidays extend their activities beyond holidaymaking to producing pornographic films using underage girls.
