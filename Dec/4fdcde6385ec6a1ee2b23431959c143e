Hundreds of people hired as suppliers and contractors stormed Kisumu county assembly on Tuesday demanding payment.They engaged police in running battles but were dispersed by the Quick Response Team, whose members fired gunshots in the air.The crowd led by their chairman Thomas Otieno later entered the assembly and demanded to speak with assembly speaker Ann Adul. But they were blocked by sergeants-at-arms and two police officers.Adul said she was in a meeting when she noticed the rowdy group in the corridors. She was she was informed that they were contractors and only agreed to meet their officials.The group demanded an explanation on how their duties, which they said amounted to millions of shillings, were going to be paid.MCAs approved a Sh717 million supplementary budget for the 2016-17 financial year last week, four months after the county budget was passed.Read: Contractors after my life, claims Kisumu finance officerIn the supplementary budget, the contractors are poised to receive Sh482.8 million for completed projects and another Sh72.1 million for roads maintenance."I was surprised when they told me someone from the executive told them I had declined to sign a document that will enable the executive to release their funds," said Adul.She added that she was auditing what had been sent by the executive, which she blamed for the delay.&ldquo;We are not to blame because we also sympathise with the contractors but the executive did not specify some of the items in the supplementary budget,&rdquo; said the speaker.She added that members wanted to be sure of what they were expected to do when the budget was brought to the assembly a month ago.Adul refuted claims that she had refused to sign documents passed in the assembly, for the payment of the contractors.She said once the Hansard report is finalised, she will forward it to the executive for further action.But county police commander Titus Yoma claimed the protesters were not contractors, and blamed the chaos on political rivalries.Yoma said no arrest was made and that no one was injured in the incident.&ldquo;We appeal to residents to refrain from unlawful acts and follow due process whenever they have grievances,&rdquo; he told the Star by phone.
