President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday said the country is considering pulling out of the International Criminal Court (ICC).The president made the comment during his address to the nation at the 53rd Jamhuri Day celebrations.Uhuru said ICC has become a tool of global power politics and not for pursuit of justice for which it was set up to dispense. "Our experience at the ICC demonstrated a glaring lack of impartiality in this institution. We have started to see many more nations openly recognizing that the ICC is not impartial," he said.The President said the consideration of pulling out of the Hague-based court comes after ICC failed to ensure there is respect for sovereignty of member states."Twice, our Parliament has passed motions to withdraw. We have sought the changes that will align the ICC to respect for national sovereignty. Those changes have not been forthcoming. We will therefore need to give serious thought to our membership," Uhuru said.Read: President Uhuru Kenyatta's 53rd Jamhuri Day speechAfrican countries such as Burundi and South Africa have signed memorandums to pave way for the exit from the ICC.Also read: ICC urges talks with African countries seeking to quitThe President further asked international organisations to refrain from trying to influence the outcome of the 2017 general elections.He said such interference, through channeling of funds into the country in the guise of supporting good governance or civic education, will not be encouraged. "I want to caution those members of the international community taking these actions that the Kenyan people do not look kindly on such actions," Uhuru said."I urge all Kenyans to reject such interference. This is our country, and no one should ever try and control our choices for their selfish interests because the true intention is to influence our electoral choices," the President said.President Uhuru Kenyatta with his Togolese counterpart Fare Gnassingbe during the 53rd Jamhuri Day celebrations at Nyayo National Stadium on Monday, December 12. /PSCU
