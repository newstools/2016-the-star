The capping of interest rates will not have a significant impact on family businesses, consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has said. Most medium and large sized businesses were already borrowing at very good interest rates, some of them even below the rate caps; so they are probably going to be largely unaffected by that law, PwC Kenya partner Michael Magus said.The PwC Family Business report 2016 shows 67 per cent of respondents are keen to draw on their profit reserves to finance business expansion, while 56 per cent plan on using bank loans.The bi-annual report launched yesterday shows most of the businesses are looking to expand to the East African region with a consideration on proximity of their businesses and political stability. Many of the businesses are very confident of growth over the next five years. They believe that they have sufficient funds internally to largely finance the growth, while others believe that they need external financing to support the growth, Magus said. The services firm said it will take more than six months to realise the full impact of capping of interest rates on family businesses, owing to a number of grey areas surrounding the law and its application .The Monetary Policy Committee on November 28, retained the Central Bank Rate at 10 per cent. The banks are to peg their lending rates at no more than four percentage points above the CBR. Since President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2016, banks have been reluctant to give credit to high-risk clients. It is not clear on what all banks have done with regards to the interest rate cap law, but banks say there are plans for innovation. If there is to be a credit squeeze, it will slow down the consumption aspect of the economy and the level of micro investment, Magus said.The survey showed that turnover from the 62 participating companies ranged from $5 million (Sh509.35 million) to more than $1 billion (Sh101.87 billion), with international sales growing from 68 per cent in 2014 to 77 per cent in 2016.
