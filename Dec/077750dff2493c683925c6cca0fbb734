Five Tharaka Nithi MCAs castigated Kindiki, who was absent. They accused the senator of focussing on faulting Ragwa, instead performing his role.Chiakariga MCA Zachary Mpanda said Kindiki has been hovering around with choppers and has done little to help the people of Tharaka Nithi.&ldquo;We want to tell him he will not be flying forever. He will come down one day,&rdquo; he said.Mpanda said the Jubilee Party preliminaries might be unfair if Kindiki presides over them as he has already formed his camp.
