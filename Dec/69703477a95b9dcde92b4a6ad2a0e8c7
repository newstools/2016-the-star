A meeting between KMPDU Bomet branch and national officials ended prematurely yesterday when Governor Isaac Rutto allegedly stormed the gathering and drew his gun at the attendees.In a statement, union secretary general Ouma Oluga alleged the governor drew his gun and pointed it at the doctors to disperse them. Rutto has denied the allegation. &ldquo;The governor has resorted to violence on his own doctors after his media propaganda was distributed to the public. We will, however, be taking very strong action to have the governor account for his intolerance and violence,&rdquo; the statement read.Addressing the press in Bomet town yesterday, Rutto said, &ldquo;I do not own a gun and if those officials claim I have one, let them produce the records. I have never applied for one and I do not intend to do so.&rdquo; Rutto had earlier reportedly demanded to be included in the meeting and when the officials refused to involve him, he left and the meeting continued.A little while later, a group of 30 youths arrived in a county vehicle and forced the officials out.The youth accused the national officials of trying to convince the county medics to join the ongoing nationwide strike. Some officials were injured after being roughed up by the youths.County chief medical services officer Bernard Sowek said the national union officers had earlier stormed Longisa County Hospital, disrupted services and warned members against boycotting the strike. The meeting convened by the Kenya Medical Practitioners&rsquo; and Dentists&rsquo; Union came a few days after Bomet officials signed a CBA with health workers. Health workers from Bomet agreed not to join their colleagues in the nationwide strike and instead held talks with the government on how to implement their pay.
