Strathmore University men&rsquo;s handball team will use the Jamhuri Cup Open tournament today at the Nyayo Stadium as build up for the forthcoming Eastern Africa University Games at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.The varsity games are between December 16 to 22.Strathmore coach Peter Mwathi said the three day event will help the students evaluate their performance even as they plan to make their debut in the regional universities games.&ldquo;Really our participation in the Jamhuri tournament is to help us evaluate our performance and make amends where we need to prior to the University games.&ldquo;That does not mean we will not be challenging for the trophy as we also want to give a good account of ourselves in the local scene,&rdquo; observed Mwathi who doubles up as the men&rsquo;s national team head coach.The students will be without forward Jefferson Aketch who is nursing a knee injury, but the tactician notes Kevin Ambuga has since filled the winger&rsquo;s position.&ldquo;We finished third in the 2016 Kenya Handball Federation national league and we hope to extend the good run in the Jamhuri Cup. Of course we will miss the services of Aketch but Ambuga has been doing justice in that department and we can only hope for the best.&rdquo;Kenya Defence Force (KDF) and National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) finished first and second respectively.The Jamhuri event has attracted top local clubs including NCPB (men and women), Kenya Defence Forces (men and women), second Brigade women, Engineers Battalion men, Fourth Brigade men, University of Nairobi (men and women) and Kenyatta University (men and women).KHF fixtures secretary Charles Omondi however, noted the Democratic Republic of Congo Police (men and women) might grace the event after the federation expanded the invite.&ldquo;The event will be played in a round-robin format from Saturday (today ) to Monday. &ldquo;DRC teams might be the surprise package and their presence will definitely spice up the competition as we intend to bring down the 2016 season on high.&rdquo; said the official.
