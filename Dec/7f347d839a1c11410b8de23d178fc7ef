The Interior ministry should arrest political leaders using youth to fuel violence ahead of next year&rsquo;s polls, Kenya Union of Civil Servants secretary general Tom Odege has said. &ldquo;We have started witnessing cases of violence in our country. This is something that must stop before election campaigns,&rdquo; he said. Political leaders must embrace peace to avoid chaos similar to the 2007-08 post-election violence, the trade unionist said. &ldquo;We have evidence of where youth have been used to attack innocent people for some politician&rsquo;s interests,&rdquo; Odege said. He spoke at Wath Ong&rsquo;er market in Nyatike during a party to celebrate his reelection. Odege said leaders should ensure resources are well distributed in all counties and constituencies to improve residents&rsquo; livelihoods. &ldquo;If resources are well used and development projects initiated, we shall never have angry and hungry youth to be misused by the rich,&rdquo; he said.
