Nairobi county assembly Speaker Alex Magelo yesterday said the assembly will be forced to come up with a bill on the administration of land with expired lease to curb land grabbing.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Magelo said the MCAs are saddened by the violent eviction of the Kurji family from their Westlands property.Last Sunday, the house of Purin Kurji, 74, and his wife, 70, was flattened by a bulldozer. The property was invaded and smashed by 20 men armed with pangas and rungus.The Kurjis were told developer Francis Njeru of Frank Logistics had taken over ownership. Magelo said in order to address such acts, a bill needs to be passed and the law implemented. &ldquo;I have asked several members of the county assembly to think of a bill in that line. It&rsquo;s only by passing a tough law governing the administration of land with expired leases that we can resolve this issue,&rdquo; he said.Magelo added, &ldquo;Once we return from recess, I expect the process to begin because it&rsquo;s by passing the law that we can have an end to this. I suggest that it should be a law that ensures only the original owner of the property can apply for lease renewal and no one else.&rdquo; Magelo condemned the demolition of the house and asked the prosecuting agents and the courts not to be lenient on Njeru.Last week, Governor Evans Kidero denied his officers were involved in the intimidation and forced eviction of the elderly couple and the bulldozing of their property.Kidero on Wednesday told a press conference that City Hall has written to the National Land Commission, demanding information on all expired leases.He appeared to heap blame on the commission, saying it might have renewed the lease for another person without consulting the county government. Njeru was arrested and released on bond as investigations continue.
