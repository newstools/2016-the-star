President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday turned the heat on Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto for his attempts to block the construction of a university in Bomet town.The President termed as selfish the governor&rsquo;s intentions to turn the land donated by the national government for the construction of Bomet University Campus into a dumb site. "You are doing something that is harmful to the children of Bomet and all the children of Kenya who will benefit from this university," said the President when he addressed thousands of residents at the university land.The President also described Rutto, who has filed an injunction against the construction of the campus, as an ungrateful person who has not only turned against his party but is also standing against the interests of the people of Bomet.Read: Governor Rutto urged to drop case halting construction University in Bomet"The people of Bomet are in agreement with us. You (Isaac Ruto) should go back to the courts and remove the case you filed to block the university," said the President.The head of state, who laid the foundation stone for the university, asked the residents whether they agreed with the attempts to turn the land into a dump site and they responded with an emphatic no.Read: Bomet residents vow to send home Governor RuttoHe said the Attorney General will in the next few days be enjoined in the case to defend the interests of the people of Bomet."This case will be between the Government of Kenya and Isaac Rutto," said the President amid cheers from the people.The President said it was unfortunate that the Bomet Governor had turned against his team mates immediately after Jubilee Governors voted for him to become the Chairman of the Council of Governor."You gave us the mandate not to fight but to deliver development like this university and the road we are launching today," said the President.Also read: Governor Rutto left stranded after Uhuru changes itinerary in BometRelated: I am ready to welcome UhuRuto in Bomet, Governor Rutto saysDeputy President William Ruto who accompanied the president at the event described attempts by governor Rutto to turn the university land into a dumping site as ridiculous."However corrupted your head becomes how can you not differentiate between the value of a university and a dumping site," said the DP.Ruto also criticized the governor for his vigorous opposition to the project to install modern equipment in hospitals."You are telling us about South Africa (where the governor travelled to for a minor medical procedure). How many in Bomet can afford to travel to South Africa for treatment? And you have been blocking the Government from equipping two hospitals in this county with modern equipment," said the DP.Related story: DP Ruto is a dictator, i won't join Jubilee, Bomet governor saysAnd: Jubilee Party has no future beyond 2017, says Governor RuttoOther leaders who accompanied the president including Majority leader Aden Duale, Senate Deputy Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Joyce Laboso and Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot also criticized governor Rutto saying his day of reckoning would come during next year&rsquo;s general elections.Duale said that that they are aware of Rutto&rsquo;s plans to transport voters from neighboring counties to vote for him, a ploy he said would not work."The decision of who becomes the Governor of Bomet will be made by the people of Bomet and no one else. Imported voters will not help you," said Duale.Murkomen accused Rutto of wasting money meant for the development of Bomet county on his personal issues like promoting a political party."We have never heard of Isaac Rutto launching any development project. All we hear him do is opening party branches and he is using money meant for the people of Bomet,&rdquo; Murkomen said.Laboso, who intends to contest for the seat of Bomet governor, said no one should hoodwink Kenyans that the support for Jubilee in Bomet could ever be in doubt.Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui also criticized the Governor whom he said does not have the interest of the people at heart."We want to use this place to benefit our youth not to store waste as Isaac Rutto wants," said the MP.The leaders were on the last day of their three-day tour of the Rift Valley where President Kenyatta has launched multi-billion shilling projects.The President later commissioned modern medical equipment worth Sh425 million installed at the Longisa Hospital, Bomet County.He said the Government will continue to carry out reforms aimed at transforming the Heath sector. Rutto is the only governor who refused to sign the Sh38 billion medical equipment deal. The President commended doctors and nurses at the hospital for not taking part in the ongoing strike.
