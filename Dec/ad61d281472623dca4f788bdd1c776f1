Every year, the family gathers at my parent&rsquo;s house for the festive season. Every year, it&rsquo;s all smiles and singing along to country songs until a fight breaks out. It happens every single year. I wonder if it&rsquo;s because country music was my dad&rsquo;s thing and he walked out on mum. Maybe the songs remind us too much of our early years, when we were all happy as only children can be. The present is much more cruel and fighting amongst each other is the only way to express this frustration. It&rsquo;s silly, though. Fighting instead of pulling together. My two sisters are both married but they&rsquo;ve had a hard time of it. Their husbands rely on them for financial support. Which is why every year, they come to my mother&rsquo;s house for Christmas instead of going to their in-law&rsquo;s homes. My two brothers are the single most misogynistic pair you could ever met. In their perfect world, all women would bow at their feet. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d move to Uganda if they could. So when these very diverse siblings come together, conflict always arises. It&rsquo;s them versus my two very independent sisters who support their men. It always gets ugly. But every year, like clockwork, we meet for the inevitable fireworks. &ldquo;Yes, mum. I&rsquo;ll be there on the 24th and leave on the 26th,&rdquo; I say.&ldquo;Only two days?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Surely you can stay a little longer?&rdquo; she urges. &ldquo;Mum, after the annual post-Christmas Day&ndash;pre-Boxing Day fist fight, it&rsquo;s always time to leave,&rdquo; I respond. She sighs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that doesn&rsquo;t happen this year,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Mum, you say that every year!&rdquo; I remind her. &ldquo;You have an undying spirit, I&rsquo;ll give you that!&rdquo;I have never gotten involved in the fights because I have no real convictions one way or the other. I&rsquo;ve never made enough money for my brothers to feel threatened by me, and I&rsquo;ve never married anyone and become the submissive wife that my sisters detest. By virtue of that, I am the Switzerland (the neutral one) in this family of Game of Thrones and the Cold War. &ldquo;What would you like for Christmas?&rdquo; I ask, changing the subject. &ldquo;New piping for the house, the ones there have rusted,&rdquo; she responds, sounding defeated. &ldquo;How much would that cost?&rdquo; I ask.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; she says with the patronising tone of a mother to her you-never-have-two-coins-to-rub-together child.&rdquo;&ldquo;Will the others pitch in to get it done?&rdquo; I ask, ignoring her tone.&ldquo;Everyone has their own issues. Cate is paying for that new expensive school. Mary is renovating her house and the boys are buying land,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; I ask again.&ldquo;Sh300,000,&rdquo; she responds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to them,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;No, dear. You&rsquo;re the only one who never fights with anyone. Don&rsquo;t start now,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Mum, Sh300, 000 between the five of us is only Sh60,000 each,&rdquo; I say.&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that your entire salary?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually Sh80,000,&rdquo; I say defensively. &ldquo;See? Your entire salary,&rdquo; she mutters. &ldquo;Leave it, dear. It will be fine.&rdquo; We say our goodbyes and I immediately call up my eldest sister. She tells me exactly the same thing mum said. No one in the family thinks fixing her pipes is a priority. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give us lectures, Samantha. Not everyone is single and living in the fast lane like you are. We have kids and responsibilities!&rdquo; she says. I&rsquo;m about to retort when Mr N walks in. &ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; I say to her and hang up.
