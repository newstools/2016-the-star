At least seven people died in public hospitals yesterday as the nurses and doctors strike continued to cause suffering and pain.In some hospitals, mortuary attendants took turns in wards to help patients in critical condition, as relatives watched helplessly.The government issued a statement yesterday, saying it &ldquo;deeply regrets&rdquo; the situation and promised to talk with the doctors and the nurses to end their strike now in its third day.&ldquo;The government notes with grave concern that the strike has disrupted the enjoyment of basic, fundamental rights for citizens across the country, and is causing incalculable pain and grief across the country,&rdquo; government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said.Mortuary attendants at the Baringo Referral Hospital said they decided to help patients, instead of waiting for the bodies at the morgue.Two people died at the hospital yesterday morning. They included a 70-year-old admitted in the facility two months ago, and a middle-aged man, who was struck by a boda boda in Marigat on Monday.The two were among 50 patients abandoned by the health workers. Some 100 critical cases were referred to private hospitals in Nakuru, Eldama-Ravine and Eldoret on Monday.Mortuary attendant Daniel Ngetich said he has received 10 bodies at hospital mortuary since Sunday.At the Coast Provincial General Hospital, three patients died waiting to be attended.One of them was Emmah Kairu, 28, who was admitted at the hospital on October 12, suffering from meningitis.Relatives taking care of three other patients at the Intensive Care Unit said they did not know how to transfer them to private facilities, because they are in a coma.At Kinango Subcounty Hospital, Kwale, one man died at the gate as his relatives were turned away.&ldquo;The situation is worse in Msambweni Referral Hospital, but we cannot do anything because the strike is on,&rdquo; a doctor, who sought anonymity, said.Talks between the Health ministry and the striking doctors collapsed again after the team from the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists&rsquo; Union walked out of the meeting at Afya House.They doctors want the government to implement the collective bargaining agreement they signed with the Health ministry in June 2013, giving them a pay rise of up to 300 per cent.The medics also want a review of their working conditions, job structures, criteria for promotions. They also want staff hired to reduce shorotage of medical professionals in state hospitals.
