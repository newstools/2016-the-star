A father of four is among 88,929 candidates who will gain admission in a public university after he scored a C+ in the 2016 KCSE exams.42-year-old Samuel Okello was a fisherman at Lwanda Konyango beach before he resumed his studies at Kibuon Mixed Secondary School in Nyatike constituency."I knew I was going to get a good grade [and] at my advanced age, I was welcome for any results [but] this has given me a chance to join university. That is beyond my wildest dream," he told journalists on Friday.For the first time in four years of undertaking the exams, the school celebrated as 15 of its students qualified for university slots.Kibuon Secondary, which is based in the semi-arid area around Lake Victoria, attributed their success to the strict conduct of this year's KCSE exams and the CDF kitty, which has facilitated learning at the institution since 2013.Kennedy Adero, the school's principal, said this year, the school took the highest number of students to university."The results will give smaller schools and those in arid areas like Kibuon [recognition]. We are elated by the results," Adero said amid celebrations."We have an arrangement in the school to allow those who are married or working to come back to school. Others who are in dire need of school fees also get help through the CDF bursary," he said.Among the beneficiaries of the kitty are Okello and 23-year-old Daniel Otieno, who got a B plain. Otieno was also a fisherman at Lwanda before he decided to continue his studies.Otieno and Okello resumed studies at the school due to its flexible means of paying fees, as well as help from the CDF kitty."We need to uplift the learning standards of the region ... we need the government to keep the high level of security in examinations to give us a chance," Okello said.Experts not surprised by 'mass failure'This year's Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education results elicited mixed reactions as the overall performance differed drastically from 2015.While more than 2,000 As were achieved in 2015, only 141 candidates gained straight As in this year's examinations.More on this: KCSE 'A' grades drop drastically in Matiang'i clean-upAlso read: KOT crack jokes about Matiang'i after early release of KCSE 2016 resultsFurthermore, out of more than 500,000 candidates, only 15 per cent scored between A and C+, which qualified them for university admission.John Mugo, Country Coordinator &ndash; Uwezo Kenya, said he was not surprised by the performance, but expressed concern with what he termed 'mass failure' that requires urgent stakeholders' attention.&ldquo;We are just getting back to the reality by bringing credibility of examinations. This failures have been there before but has always been hidden by either drilling or cheating,&rdquo; Mugo said.He said teachers often concentrate on bright students and ignore slow learners, leading to an abnormal learning curve where many students have failed.Other than reforming teaching skills to improve quality Mugo called rethinking on the means of examining students.&ldquo;We can label failure less if we diversify evaluation away from just academic, but also test other talents like physical activities and other expressive arts,&rdquo; he said.Educationist Professor Douglas Odhiambo, on his part, said he was not surprised.&ldquo;I am at peace with the performance. In a natural setting it's impossible to have so many candidates scoring As,&rdquo; he said.He argued that this was a right start on the restructuring of education system and bringing back its glory.University parallel programme expected to sufferSome 482,232 candidates who scored between C and E are expected to be absorbed in polytechnic, tertiary and middle level colleges.Experts observe that this will make many public and private universities close shop for lack of students to admit.&ldquo;Universities will suffer drastically with this performance, but market demands will play a key role here. But its good for our country as now the battle will shift from the race of churning out quantity to quality graduates,&rdquo; Mugo said.On his part, Odhiambo said universities should reorganisethemselves and make their programs attractive and competitive to be able to remain relevant by competition for the thinning number of students.
