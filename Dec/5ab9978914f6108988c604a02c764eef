President Uhuru Kenyatta has cautioned the police service commission against discouraging police from running businesses.He said that police officers, like any other Kenyan, have a right to invest.The president urged the commission led by Johnston Kavuludi to stop linking such ventures to acts of corruption.Uhuru on Saturday, during the opening of the Kenya Police Sacco plaza at Ngara, told police officers to borrow loans and do legitimate businesses.He made the comments during the launch of 'I-cash' - a platform that allows police officers to access loans through their mobile phones.Uhuru appealed to the officers to develop a culture of taking up loans for business so as to improve their living standards."In our environment where traditional banks are uncomfortable to extend credit to small business enterprises, Sacco's have proved a valuable alternative source of financial services," the president said."Nyinyi polisi msikubali tu ati ukijenga nyumba unaambiwa ni corruption, Bwana Kavuludi wacha watu wajiendeleze, wanakopa pesa kutoka sacco yao ndio waweze kujenga nyumba kama wakenya wengine, (Police must not accept being condemned for putting up investments...Kavuludi, leave these people to develop themselves...they can borrow from their sacco and develop property like other Kenyans)," Uhuru said."Kuna wachache wabaya lakini wengi hii ndio wanafanya. Kwa hivyo mtu asione polisi akifanya maendeleo alafu ansema eti ameiba, nani ameiba? (There are a few officers with notorious behavior but majority take loans. So, let no one see a police officer doing investment then brand them thieves, who has stolen?)," he added.Uhuru lauded the Sacco for its efforts on bringing more members on board since its inception."Sacco's are playing an important role in giving access to affordable credit. Bringing over 56,000 members on board over the years shows that the management of the police sacco is focused to ensure police get cheaper services to all members," he said.He said the government was set to give tax relief to Savings Credit and Cooperative Organizations as they play a pivotal role in improving the lives of Kenyans.Uhuru said tax laws will be amended in the next financial year to boost the operations of the micro-finance sector players."This&nbsp; move is part of my government's&nbsp; efforts to encourage uptake of credit including mortgages that allow more Kenyans to own homes. This tax relief will be given to SACCOs just like other financial institutions which give mortgage loans," he said.
