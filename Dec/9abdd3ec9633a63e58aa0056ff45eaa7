A Nairobi MCA suspended for 30 sitting days for &lsquo;gross misconduct&rsquo; during tabling of the motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero has sued speaker Alex Magelo. Nelson Masiga was suspended on October 4 after he defied Magelo&rsquo;s order to leave. He and other ODM ward representatives had protested against Magelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;tough rules&rdquo;. The speaker had prohibited MCAs from booing and shouting at Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang&rsquo;wara, who was to table the motion. The Eastleigh South MCA refused to leave and the serjeant-at-arms tried to eject him. But other ODM lawmakers started chanting &ldquo;Magelo must go,&rdquo;causing mayhem and disrupting business. After push-and-pull between the MCAs and serjeant-at-arms, Masiga was forced to leave and the motion passed. Yesterday the ward representative told the Star the punishment was harsh.
