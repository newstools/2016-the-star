Kenyans now want to see unscrupulous individuals behind bars because they have suffered for a long time in the hands of the crooked leaders,&rdquo; he said.The MP said leaders in the county governments are on the spot for misappropriation of public resources.Kamau, who wants to run for Murang&rsquo;a governor, said agencies mandated to scrutinise and fight graft, including the DPP&rsquo;s office, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, should expedite their investigations and apprehend corrupt individuals for Kenyans to get justice.Corruption cases hurt jubileeGraft cases unraveled in the ministries in the last four years have been a big blow to the Jubilee administration and might dent UhuRuto&rsquo;s reelection chances if not dealt with, the legislator said.The opposition has capitalised on the cases to attack the government and allege that President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s leadership is a failure, he said.&ldquo;The opposition has been relentless in smearing Jubilee with mud over graft cases. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his administration have worked tirelessly to fight the corruption giant that has been a threat to our country&rsquo;s economy and the setting up of the court to fight graft is a score for Jubilee,&rdquo; Kamau added.Wahome warned that all corrupt individuals, including those in the Jubilee administration, will be punished according to the law.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hiding place for corrupt officials. The law will soon catch up with them and they will pay dearly for their crooked practices,&rdquo; he said.Chege said the special court should work round the clock to ensure the guilty are jailed.
