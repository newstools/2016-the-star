Saying it would not relent, Cord has pledged to do everything possible today to prevent Jubilee from forcing through amendments to weaken election laws.&ldquo;We are fully aware of a recall of the House [today] to pursue the same mischief but our resolve to stand our ground has not changed. We will take the ball to their court. We are waiting for them," Cord co-principal Moses Wetang'ula said.The Senate minority leader accused the Jubilee leadership of using the National Assembly with its tyranny of numbers as a launching pad to rig and steal the 2017 election.He addressed journalists at the Cord secretariat after a Cord parliamentary group meeting.&ldquo;We will demonstrate that what they are doing is leading this country to a direction that is dangerous,&rdquo; the Bungoma senator said. "Even Kenyans know that stealing elections is unconstitutional and illegal.&rdquo;The key amendment, among others, sought by Jubilee and the IEBC allows for manual identification of voters and transmission of election results, if the electronic systems fail, as they did in 2013.The law in question requires an integrated electronic system and says nothing about manual voting, tabulation and results transmission. The law is the product of negotiations by Cord and Jubilee, led by a committee of 14 members of equal proportion from both sides. Both sides agreed there would be no amendments.Now Jubilee and the IEBC say that law and some timelines are unrealistic and must be amended.On Tuesday, chaos erupted in the National Assembly as Cord MPs thwarted Majority Leader Aden Duale and Jubilee MPs who tried to pass the amendments.The state cordoned off Parliament and deployed riot police and even water cannons in anticipation of trouble. MPs had to walk a distance to the chamber and called the measures intimidation.For the first time, MPs were not allowed to drive to Parliament Buildings as they were forced to alight at the Intercontinental Hotel and trek 400 metres.At the Parliament gate, they underwent a thorough security screening.Opposition MPs blocked Speaker Justin Muturi from entering for more than two hours The session was delayed from 9.30 until noon.&ldquo;The continuing unnecessary and unhelpful provocation by Jubilee at the time doctors are on strike, the increasing carnage on our roads, among other things, shows they are more concerned with stealing the elections,&rdquo; Wetang'ula said.The sustained efforts from the Cord side, led by deputy leader of minority Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem) saw the session degenerated into a shouting contest. Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo was outraged by the proposed changes and called President Uhuru Kenyatta "extremely stupid and a fake President."In another incident, Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said his eyes were injured when a Jubilee woman MP from Nyeri country sprayed pepper spray in his face.Reacting to the Tuesday chaos, Wetang&rsquo;ula said Cord will raise the problem with the House Powers and Privileges Committee to punish MPs who smuggled in weapons.Brace for uproar today as Jubilee tries again to bulldoze amendments.
