Most secondary schools in Elgeyo Marakwet county remained deserted yesterday as school managers said they were still analysing the 2016 KCSE exam results. No school in the county produced a straight A in the results released by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i on Thursday.At St Patrick&rsquo;s High School, one of the two national schools in the county, gates remained closed as teachers and school managers came to terms with the reality of not posting a single A.This was contrary to the celebrations witnessed in March, when the school posted 10 straight As and 57 A- in the 2015 KCSE exam. &ldquo;We have not received the full results, but we did not manage an A plain,&rdquo; principal Wilson Yego said. Sing&rsquo;ore Girls&rsquo; High School, another top performing school in the county, had nothing to celebrate as it did not produce an A plain, despite posting 200 straight As in 2015.
