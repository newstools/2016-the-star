Commission on Revenue Allocation chairman Micah Cheserem wants constitutional amendments to enable governors to serve a single term of eight years.This will protect them from the pressure they face from their opponents in general elections.He said seeking a reelection puts governors under pressure, making them perform dismally.&ldquo;Governors are actually under pressure to campaign in order to retain their seats. But that pressure would not have been there if they had a single term of eight years,&rdquo; Cheserem said.He spoke on Friday when he visited Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata.MPs should amend the Constitution to effect the proposal so that governors have ample time to implement development projects, Cheserem said.The Constitution subjects the county chiefs to campaigns every five years, denying them the opportunity to serve their people, he said.MPs have failed to push for devolution of more funds, Cheserem said. &ldquo;MPs are becoming a threat to devolution,&rdquo; he added.The outgoing chairman criticised senators for fighting governors with the aim of unseating them.He also accused the national government of inadequate distribution of funds to counties.
