Parliament's Public Accounts Committee has finally invited Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen for questioning on the Sh1.8 billion NYS scandal.Sing oei, Murkomen &amp; Sigei Advocates, a law firm owned by Murkomen, received Sh15 million from Out of the Box Solutions, which has been linked to the scandal.PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo said the committee met on Thursday and "collectively" agreed that Murkomen, the Senate deputy majority leader, should face them on December 8. We decided that the partners in the law firm make a personal appearance, he said.This was after the law firm failed to send written submissions to the committee by close of business on Wednesday, which had been set as the deadline.More on this: Murkomen, Ruto's aide got Sh15 million devolution cashGumbo said DP William Ruto's aide Farouk Kibet made a submission to the committee regarding the millions of shillings he received from NYS suspect Josephine Kabura under unclear circumstances.The watchdog team will make a decision on whether to invite Kibet after scrutinising his submissions.Read: Farouk Kibet establishes link between NYS suspects Kabura and GethiGumbo also sought Speaker Justin Muturi's help in controlling members debating the substance of the NYS probe outside the committee.He said the committee s investigations should not be raw material for political wars. We will not allow such a debate to sway the decision of the committee," the Rarienda MP said.Suba MP John Mbadi, a member of PAC, claimed on Tuesday that the committee has been compromised and will not deliver an objective probe into the saga.Mbadi also claimed, during a live TV interview, that the committee, the chairman in particular, was reluctant in summoning Murkomen and Kibet.He had also written to Gumbo asking him to summon the two over the morphing scandal, saying the decision to have them make written submissions was not collective.But Gumbo said the MP's letter was not in good faith. I wonder why a member of the committee with unfettered access to it, wrote to me insinuating reluctance of the chairman to invite the pair, Gumbo said in a letter to Mbadi, which he read to the House.Standing Order 86 requires MPs to desist from discussing matters under consideration by a committee of Parliament.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale thrust Mbadi into the saga. He tabled before the House the names of two companies he said are associated with MP and which landed multi-million contracts with the National Youth Service.Duale said he will write to the PAC asking the committee to probe Omos Supplies and Takawili to establish who its directors are.Read: Junet Mohamed received Sh129 million from NYS - Jubilee MPsAlso read: ODM leaders are shielding Waiguru after benefiting from NYS scam - Murkomen
