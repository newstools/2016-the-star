DPP Keriako Tobiko was pressured to charge Kiambu Governor William Kabogo over statements he made allegedly targeted towards Cord leader Raila Odinga, a court heard yesterday. National Cohesion and Integration Commission chief investigating officer Robert Mabera told court the organisation had recommended Kabogo be subjected to a reconciliation process but the DPP&rsquo;s office insisted he be charged with hate speech.Mabera, who appeared before magistrate Martha Mutuku following summons, did not say where the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; came from.He said the commission felt it would not be easy to sustain the charge against the governor using a video clip because it could not be unauthenticated.Witnesses were not willing to record statements and testify, the court heard.Raila said Kabogo&rsquo;s statements made at Thika Municipal Stadium during the celebrations to mark the music career of musician John Demathew, were intended to incite feelings of contempt against certain communities in Kenya who do not embrace circumcision traditions.Mabera said the commission was unable to get the raw footage of the alleged remarks by the accused and the venue where the alleged meeting took place. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the DPP&rsquo;s office that came with the conclusion that the governor be charged. The NCIC had no powers to stop the same since it is within the mandate of the DPP to draft the charge sheet and recommend prosecution," said Mabera.The case against Kabogo has severally hit a dead end to a point of prompting the prosecutor to plead with the court to adjourn the matter to allow him review the file.State prosecutor Duncan Ondimu made the application saying he wanted to avoid repetition.
