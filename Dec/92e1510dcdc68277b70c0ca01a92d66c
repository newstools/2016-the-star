Wajir county staff are in a dilemma after it emerged there are no documents to prove remittances of some of their statutory and sacco deductions.This follows the Auditor General Edward Ouko s last month report that indicated the county government is unable to account for Sh2 billion it spent in the last financial year.Though Sh53.6 million statutory deductions and contributions of the county employees is said to have been paid to the Kenya Revenue Authority, LapFund and Saccos, there is no documentary evidence to show that the monies were paid to them, according to a report by the auditor general.In the last financial year ended June, 30, the KRA collected Sh1.210 trillion against a target of Sh1.2174 trillion.The revelation comes a few weeks after it emerged that an estimated 1,500 employees of Technical University of Kenya could lose their pension savings after the institution failed to remit to their scheme, despite deductions from their salaries.The Retirement Benefits Authority has said the university cited financial strain for its failure to submit the cash.In Wajir, the auditor general notes there was financial impropriety as value for money in the expenditures cannot be ascertained.For instance, Sh1.12 billion paid to contractors to upgrade Wajir county roads, and Sh279.8 million paid for capital projects undertaken by the ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture and Water cannot be fully accounted for. In some cases, no contract agreements were signed between the contractors and the county government as required by the law. Technical evaluation analysis did not show the criteria used, and therefore it is difficult to ascertain whether it was done fairly, Ouko says in the report. The report also highlights that the county is claiming Sh670.5 million in pending bills but no documentation contract agreements, LPOs, invoices and payment vouchers were produced to support the claim.The office of the governor is alleged to have paid Sh20.1 million to casual labourers, but their number and the nature of services rendered was not explained to support the huge expenditure .Irregular construction of drifts and bush clearing works amounting to Sh58.8 million have been questioned. The auditor noted some contract agreements between the county and contractors had not been signed as required by the law, and that there were no letters of acceptance to support the expenditures.Road works were procured without competitive bidding and the contract cost was not a proper charge to the public funds. It was also established that the works were not in the procurement plan and were not budgeted for the financial year under review.
