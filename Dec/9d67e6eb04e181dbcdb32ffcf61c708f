This year&rsquo;s Kenya tax ambassador John Macharia has urged the Kenya Revenue Authority to start offering mobile services in remote parts of the country.Macharia, alias Jomagi, 42, on Thursday said it is important to having a mobile van to reach out to Kenyans and train them on how to file tax returns.He said there are people in business, who do not pay taxes, mostly from rental income due to lack of information.&ldquo;Some are old men and they get penalised. KRA decentralised filing of returns at cybercafes but they are not in rural areas,&rdquo; Macharia said.He spoke in Nyeri town when he started his nationwide campaign of educating businessmen on the need of paying tax and filing returns.Macharia, who is a Mukurweini businessman, urged for compulsory issuance of electronic tax register machines to all businesses, including small entrepreneurs to seal revenue loopholes.The trader was crowned as the Tax Ambassador by President Uhuru Kenyatta in October for encouraging more than 70 Nyeri landlords to pay taxes.In 2015-16 KRA collected Sh1.210 trillion and targets to raise Sh1.4 trillion this financial year.
