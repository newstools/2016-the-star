Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga has accused ODM national chairman John Mbadi of partisanship ahead of the party primaries in February.Ruth said the Suba MP's action of inviting incumbent governors to fundraisers in the constituency does not assure other aspirants of free and fair nominations."As the chairman, he should be neutral and focus on how best ODM party can be made more vibrant," Ruth said, adding that the MP should resign if he cannot handle his roles."Mbadi should support party structures so that we can have free, fair and transparent nominations."The Deputy Governor further said in Kisumu on Monday that Mbadi must remain independent and neutral where political activities of those interested in ODM tickets are concerned. Mbadi hosted Governors Jack Ranguma (Kisumu) and Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay) to a harambee in his constituency last week, a move that raised questions about his independence.Ruth said the chairman's action led to the conclusion that he supported their candidature in the 2017 polls."Some of the Governors who are now close to Mbadi have done nothing substantive for the party. Their development records are wanting," she said.The DG asked ODM secretary general Agnes Zani to take action against party officials perceived to be using their positions for such gains.Ruth also asked the party to discipline politicians who perpetrate violence against their opponents, especially women.She said MCAs, MP, senators and governors fueling violence against their rivals should be disqualified."We must remain focused on making the party vibrant. Fighting and chaos are denting the party&rsquo;s image to the benefit of our competitors," she said."Those behind violence should stop giving Raila a hard time because he is not supporting any particular candidate."She noted that Raila has not endorsed any candidate for any position in the nominations and next year's August 8 general election.Read: ODM outlines strict rules for aspirants before nominationsRaila earlier said the party will vet all candidates, conduct opinion polls and subject the aspirants to a popular vote."The most popular candidate will be handed the ODM nomination.
