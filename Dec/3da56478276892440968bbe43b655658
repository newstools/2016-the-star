Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday dismissed proposals by those behind the National Super Alliance to change the Constitution and create positions of two Deputy Presidents, a Prime Minister and two Deputy Prime Ministers. He termed the proposal selfish, egocentric and unworkable. These people don t know what they want and where they will take Kenya, Ruto said in Kericho.Sources privy to the proposal say either Raila Odinga or Musalia Mudavadi will be the presidential candidate. The one who loses out to the other will be the Prime Minister. The team has also proposed two positions of Deputy President, one for Kanu leader Gideon Moi so he can have a sufficient profile to fight Ruto in Rift Valley. The DP made the remarks in Keongo Primary School, Ainamoi, during his tour of the South Rift.
