Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero wants the Nation Media Group to apologise in its Daily Nation newspaper for publishing defamatory articles against his character or face a lawsuit.He wants the apology published &ldquo;in the same manner, emotion, skill, pulse and prominence allocated to the offensive articles.&rdquo;Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, Kidero says the two front page articles, one run on December 5, titled &lsquo;Sh20 Billion audit shocker for county&rsquo; and another on December 8, with the headline &lsquo;Fresh bid to probe Kidero NGO&rsquo;s cash&rsquo; are meant to attack &ldquo;my person&rdquo;.&ldquo;For avoidance of doubt, I intend to pursue this matter through legal redress to its logical conclusion to protect my rights and also protect my family who have immensely suffered from these persistent attacks,&rdquo; reads the demand letter.The first article claims to quote the Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the financial accounts of the Nairobi government. Kidero said the article portrays him as corrupt when &ldquo;it seems to suggest that an audit query is the same or amounts to corruption.&rdquo;The second article attempts to link the &ldquo;purported loss&rdquo; of billions of shillings from city coffers to an NGO claimed to be associated with Kidero.&ldquo;The source of the story is unnamed from the NGO Coordination Board. It is unethical, unfair and morally wrong to run a story with grave accusations and contrived lies without mention of the source and evidential support,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It remains speculative, irreverent and hurtful to the intended victim certainly to wield maximum desecration of image but avoid responsibility at all costs.&rdquo;
