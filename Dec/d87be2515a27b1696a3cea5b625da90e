COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli has called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to personally mediate in talks between doctors and their employer to end the current stalemate in the health sector.In a statement on Tuesday, Atwoli said this will be the fastest way to address the issues raised by doctors."Health is a key sensitive sector to any nation that it wouldn&rsquo;t take any government even a day to overlook the sector. COTU now calls upon the President to personally intervene in the matter and initiate immediate dialogue between the striking doctors and the government. Kenyans are dying in our hospitals and nobody seems to care," he stated.Read : Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreement"COTU is urging both parties to respect our enormous Industrial Relations Machinery which if properly utilized, there would be no need of referring matters to the Courts and we are also appealing to the Courts to be lenient towards the striking workers and play a reconciliatory role instead of being punitive", Atwoli said.This comes as the confrontation between the doctors and the government intensified after the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) withdrew its members from the Kenyatta National Hospital private wing and threatened to extend this withdrawal to private hospitals across the country.Read: Health crisis deepens as private hospitals prepare to join doctors' strikeThe government offered a Sh50,000 increase for the lowest paid doctors, which would raise their salaries to Sh176,000, but unions rejected it and walked out of talks.President Uhuru also urged doctors to return to work promising that a solution would be found.More on this: Uhuru urges striking doctors to return to work, pledges to resolve rowAlso read: As doctors strike continues, KOT demand Uhuru help to stop deaths
