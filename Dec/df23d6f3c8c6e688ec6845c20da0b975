Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed will face off with her competitors in a public debate to be hosted at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa on Friday.The AU, through its African Union Leadership Academy, will convene the first leadership debate for candidates contesting for the AU Commission chairperson.Other candidates contesting to replace outgoing chairperson Dlamini Zuma of South Africa are Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi of Botswana, Faki Mahamat of Chad, Mba Mokuy of Equatorial Guinea and Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal.The elections will be next month during the AU Heads of State Summit after the July election failed because the candidates did not get enough votes. Kenya has engaged in a charm offensive to get Mohamed the votes required in shuttle diplomacy driven by the presidency.Last week, Mohamed received an important endorsement, in person, from Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn at the Menelik Palace, Addis Ababa.The debate will be conducted before a live audience comprising members of the African Union Executive Council, members of the Permanent Representatives Committee, African Union commissioners, media and invited guests.It aims at popularising the African Union and giving the candidates an opportunity to speak to Africans and present their vision for the fulfillment of the AU vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa. The event will be live streamed on the AU website and will be broadcast by several television stations across the continent.
