The Kisumu government has this year collected Sh1 billion of the projected Sh1.8 billion revenue collection.Communications and Planning chief officer George Anyonga yesterday said the county has experienced problems in revenue collection in the last three years.Anyonga said the county has launched the automated revenue collection and e-construction system to improve efficiency in services.He said the e-system has helped eradicate corruption from cartels out to defraud the public funds. &ldquo;The electronic system has reduced human contact, thereby helping us to seal loopholes of losing money,&rdquo; Anyonga said.He spoke during a workshop on electronic trade licencing. Anyonga said they expect to increase collections from single business permit with the e-system from Sh80 million last year to Sh120 million this year. He said a provisional trade licence is generated immediately and inspection done within 30 days from the date of submission.A recent revenue study by the World Bank shows Kisumu has the potential to collect Sh2 billion in one year.
