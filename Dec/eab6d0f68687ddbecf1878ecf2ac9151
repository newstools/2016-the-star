A tall woman tries to break through a high stone wall, then drops her hammer in defeat.The wall is grey, she&rsquo;s draped in grey, her skin is ashen. We cannot see her face.High above, there&rsquo;s a tiny rectangle of light &mdash; she reaches up and can barely touch it.This painting is titled &ldquo;Hard to Break Out.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s the work of 21-year-old Alpha Mukange, a Congolese refugee in Kakuma camp in Turkana.His images and his words speak for several hundred thousand refugees at Kakuma and Dadaab camps in northern Kenya. Trapped, mostly stateless.Alpha and his sister have been there for six years, after fleeing Walungu village in South Kivu.His father, a small trader, got a small inheritance. Everyone wanted it. The raging family dispute over land led to the murder of his mother, who refused to turn over the title deed. She was shot dead. His sister Linda hid under the bed during the killing.Alpha and Linda fled with a Catholic priest, a family friend who took them to Kenya.&ldquo;I feel like a prisoner, I can&rsquo;t leave, I don&rsquo;t know what to do or what will happen, &ldquo; Mukange says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here.&rdquo;His painting is among works of 18 refugee artists from Kakuma and Dadaab recently displayed in Nairobi at the National Museum and several venues.Musicians also performed, mostly rap, and hope their CDs sell.The exhibition and performances were sponsored by UNHCR, the Danish Refugee Council, various NGOs and governments.The program Artists for Refugees is therapy, skills training and a way to show the &lsquo;outside world&rsquo; that refugees are just people with problems &mdash; rights.Victor Ndula, editorial cartoonist, illustrator and comic artist, heads the visual arts team of well-known illustrators, cartoonists and painters. He teaches, mentors, organises training, arranges exhibitions and contacts for refugee artists. And he scouts for talent.&ldquo;Artists for Refugees is important because it offers refugees dignity, hope and most important it informs a paradigm shift in thinking &mdash; that they are productive members of this society,&rdquo; Ndula says.There&rsquo;s a lot of art about loss and loneliness, but not all is dreary. There are incisive, bitter cartoons and bright splashes of rage, hope and humour.NO WORD FROM FAMILYMeantime, Alpha has heard no word of his father, a clothes seller, and five siblings. He doesn&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re alive, if they surrendered the title deed and fled.He gets Sh6,000 a month. During the day, he works in a print shop and paints signs.Alpha plays basketball.When Unicef brings materials, he can paint.GIRL WITH NO NAMEA little girl painted in many colours wears a red necklace. The portrait is titled &ldquo;Red Necklace&rdquo;. She has a small shimmering aura. The vivid colours belie her mood. She looks grave.She has no name.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an innocent, she&rsquo;s all girls, all refugee girls&rdquo; says painter Elias Lemma, 43, a former journalist and cartoonist who fled Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 15 years ago. He&rsquo;s a slight man, wearing his greying hair pulled back in a ponytail.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back, there&rsquo;s no freedom of expression. And I can&rsquo;t work here and lead a normal life,&rdquo; Lemma says.The government tried to arrest him for an article in his independent newspaper Maebel. It was about $94 million looted by the government, the documentation sent from overseas by a man who worked in the government and fled into exile. The government brands the source a terrorist.Police wanted the document, but it remains hidden. They broke into the newspaper office, smashed computers, took disks, arrested Lemma&rsquo;s secretary who didn&rsquo;t know his password.He fled fled to Nairobi, leaving his family in Addis. He painted. He moved to Kakuma 10 years ago.Today Lemma is a stock clerk for Lutheran World Services, handling educational materials. He edits the English language Kakuma News Reflector (https://kanere.org,), a refugee free press, and mediates disputes &mdash; mostly fights over water &mdash; involving the Ethiopian community. He earns Sh5,500 a month.He has applied for asylum in the US, but says his interview was difficult.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will happen,&rdquo; Lemma says.Meantime, he paints to describe life in the camp and express himself &mdash; impossible in Ethiopia.NO GOING BACKElsewhere in Kakuma, Ismahan Hussein Jimle paints intricate henna designs to cheer herself up and take her mind off a life of uncertainties and a clouded future.The 35-year-old from Mogadishu has been in Kakuma since 1991. She fled with her parents and two siblings after their relatives &mdash; from the minor Midgaan Madibaan clan &mdash; were murdered by a larger clan.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go back because they will kill us,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And here we don&rsquo;t associate much because people from the larger clan just ignore us.&rdquo;Ismahan got married in the camp and today she has six children, the youngest two and a half, the eldest 12. Her husband is unemployed. Her father died.Her mother runs a small shop where she paints henna decorations for weddings and special occasions. Decorating both hands costs Sh1,000, depending on the design. She taught Ismahan how to prepare and apply henna that grows in the desert.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very stressful and hard here because of the poverty and because I have six children to take care of,&rdquo; Ismahan says.&ldquo;I just live each day as it comes. I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to us.&rdquo;In the meantime, she paints henna designs. Encouraged by her teacher to try different subjects,she painted a smiling woman in profile with long flowing hair of tangled henna designs.
