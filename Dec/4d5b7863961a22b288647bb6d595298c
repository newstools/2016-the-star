Former Higher Education minister Prof Margaret Kamar has urged the government to form an agency to take care of medical doctors&rsquo; terms and conditions of service. Kamar (pictured) called for the formation of the Health Service Commission. She said it is wrong for the national and county governments to subject doctors to unnecessary salary disputes.&ldquo;The government should understand that medical doctors are not just national employees but also international workers whose services are most-sought-after globally,&rdquo; she said. Kamar asked the doctors to be lenient and engage the government in dialogue over the implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Kamar was speaking at her Eldoret residence, where she launched her bid for Uasin Gishu senator. She will run on the Jubilee Party ticket. &ldquo;My main agenda when I capture the seat is to ensure all functions that fall under the Health sector are devolved,&rdquo; Kamar said. She promised to be transparent and accountable to the voters. The seat is currently held by Isaac Melly, who has promised to give his opponents a run for their money in his quest to retain his seat.
