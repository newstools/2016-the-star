A company claiming ownership of Sh2.4 billion disputed land in Lavington, Nairobi, wants DPP Keriako Tobiko to explain why the daughter of the late powerful 1970s Cabinet minister Mbiyu Koinange has never been prosecuted.Through lawyer Philip Nyachoti, Nairobi House Limited said it leased the seven acres for 999 years.The letter indicates that after DCI investigations between 2005-06, it was recommended that Lennah Koinange be charged with forging ownership documents.Nyachoti said the DCI file number disappeared and the criminal case that commenced in the Kibera court stalled. NHL wants Tobiko to explain why the case has stalled since 2007. In February 2007, High Court judge Roselyn Wendoh ruled that Lennah&rsquo;s claim to the land was illegitimate.Nyachoti now wants the office of the DPP to expedite criminal proceedings immediately. According to the letter, there have been attempts by the office of the DCI to have NHL&rsquo;s title held by Diamond Trust Bank limited surrendered.
