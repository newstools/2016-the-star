Kenyans on social media have criticised remarks made by Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a 'fake President who should go back to his Gatundu&nbsp; backyard." Millie on Tuesday asked Uhuru to stop harassing Kenyans by barring MPs from accessing parliament for the special sitting."I dedicated this day to telling the President all the negative things I have. We fought for this country as he was in foreign land so President Uhuru cannot dictate his powers to me or any other elected member," she stated."Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is a fake President as his own backyard is poor. We have come here prepared for death and we are going to Canaan not back to Egypt," the MP added.Millie further alleged that the President rigged the 2013 general election and was therefore not elected."Who does he think he is, he does not even compare to me leave alone Raila Odinga, tell him he can take me to court. He is extremely stupid and my conscience tells me so....msheenzi," Millie said.Read: [VIDEO] Parliament buildings blockaded by police, MPs forced to walk ahead of IEBC sittingBut Kenyans took to social media and reacted to Millie's remarks."Freedom of expression does not include insulting the President. That's treason. Dignified women hold their tongues always,"&nbsp; Sally Salome tweeted.Mike Mburia said it was wrong for the ODM legislator to disrespect Uhuru as a person as well as the office of the Presidency. "Millie Odhiambo has just shown the kind of people who should not be elected and should have never been elected anywhere at any level because they do not respect our institutions."Marie Mwangi criticised the behavior which happened outside Parliament buildings saying Millie took advantage of her gender."Millie Odhiambo is a very disrespectful woman from what I have seen, I'm all for girl power and but this woman is completely crazy to rant what she said because she is a woman."Bedan Komu expressed distaste at the level which leaders will go to seek votes or please their bosses saying it was against the integrity act for Millie to have uttered the words she did."I do not blame Millie Odhiambo, we all know it is campaign time and all leaders are competing to please their bosses so it could be just business," his tweet read.Sam Philips said no matter the wrongdoing by the government the legislator went overboard with her alteration to President Uhuru Kenyatta."We should and must not cheer Millie Odhiambo because it is a shame for her as an elected member of the National Assembly to have said what she did. Two wrongs have never made a right and she should have known that."However others lauded the MP for the move saying Millie expressed what most Kenyans feel over the government's preparedness for the general election."Millie Odhiambo was just saying what Kenyans are thinking , Uhuru's government is trying to take us for a ride again and steal votes in the 2017 polls." Urban black tweeted.Job Oyengo said insults from politicians have become the order of the day and called on Kenyans not to crucify Millie for standing her ground."Don't judge Millie Odhiambo she did exactly what Duale, Kuria, Ruto and Uhuru have done before. Let's be realistic and let her be.""Kenyan ladies should borrow a leaf from Millie Odhiambo, power isn't given on a silver platter you must fight for it," Khaemba Wandabusi said lauding Millie for being strong and bold.
