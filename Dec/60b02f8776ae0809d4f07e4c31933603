The Law Society of Kenya has faulted how the elections laws were amended.LSK President Isaac Okero (pictured) yesterday told the Star on the phone that &ldquo;a bi-partisan agreement is what is needed.&rdquo;The amendment, which was sponsored by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chairman Samuel Chepkonga passed during a special sitting on December 22, after a similar sitting that had been convened was disrupted on December 20. &ldquo;The leadership needs to reclaim confidence of the entire country,&rdquo; Okero said.Among the changes under the controversial laws, is a provision that allows for manual identification of voters if the electronic system fails. But Cord leaders term this as a &ldquo;plot to rig the elections&rdquo;.MPs also adopted a proposal for manual transmission of results, after Cord MPs walked out of Parliament in protest.Cord leader Raila Odinga has given the government nine days to reverse the controversially amended election laws.He said their protests will take place from January 4, should President Uhuru Kenyatta go ahead to assent to the law.Okero asked why the amendments were hurriedly passed, despite the fact that both Cord and Jubilee have negotiated.In a statement in December 22, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission said the country faces &ldquo;unwarranted grandstanding that is not helpful&rdquo;.Okero said the process of amending the election laws should have been bi-partisan.
