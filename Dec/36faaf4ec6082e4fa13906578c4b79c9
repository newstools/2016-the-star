Senators yesterday joined governors in opposing the move by the national government to hire medical staff on behalf of the counties.While calling on the national government to stop the process, the senators said the move is unconstitutional as health is a devolved function.Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro said he received a protest note from the governors asking him to order that Health CS Cleopa Mailu be summoned to explain why the national government was clinging to a devolved function. The national government cannot recruit on behalf of the counties or purport to discharge county functions, without their express permission. There was no such concurrence, Ekwee said. Last week, the county bosses said they will no longer accept health workers hired by the national government. Governors Council chairman and Meru governor Peter Munya said the national government should concentrate on the referral hospitals and allow the county governments to run their management affairs. Health is a devolved function and the recent adverts in daily newspapers are uncalled for, Munya said.Migori Senator Wilfred Machage, who chairs the Health committee, said the Constitution is clear that one level of government has no right to interfere with the constitutional functions of another level. The national government is carrying out an illegality to force medical personnel on the county governments. This should stop. The national government has other important things to do, he said. Machage said the national government s interference with health issues is to blame for numerous strikes.
