The directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta on speed bumps on major highways has been welcomed by leaders in Naivasha, with calls for more road safety signs. Two days after 40 people died in Naivasha, the leaders noted that failure to erect warnings on the road led to the accident. During Jamhuri Day celebrations, Uhuru criticised the Kenya National Highways Authority for erecting speed bumps on major roads without consultation. Uhuru said failure to erect warnings on where the bumps are placed contributed to the Naivasha accident which left 13 of his elite guards dead. A lorry heading to Uganda lost control after hitting a speed bump, ramming into 14 vehicles and bursting into a fireball. Speaking in Naivasha yesterday, former Nacada chairman John Mututho said the speed bump in Karai is dangerous. He said more than 20 accidents have been reported at the centre, mainly due to the sharp bump that was erected next to a bridge. &ldquo;We support the directive by the president on the speed bumps and call on the highway authority to relocate the speed bump in Raini soonest possible,&rdquo; he said. The sentiments were echoed by politician Anthony Rebo, who supported the directive by the President. He said there are no warning signs on the highway. Speaking during Jamhuri Day celebrations at Kihoto Grounds in Naivasha, Rebo called for urgent measures on the bumps before more accidents are reported.
