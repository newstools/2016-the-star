He will run against the incumbent Arthur Odera. &ldquo;I am the medicine of poverty in the area. I will strive to do my best,&rdquo; he said.Pressed to disclose the party he will run on, Oku said he is still scouting for the best option.&ldquo;Like the King of Lesotho, I will parade the ladies before deciding which the best for me to marry,&rdquo; he said.The Administration Police was allegedly partly responsible for the mayhem that followed the December 2007 elections. Oku left Kenya in April 2010 amid rumours that he was a key witness for the ICC prosecutor. He returned to the country last April. &ldquo;I know everybody prayed for me when I fled the country since my life was in danger. God is my protector. I am here today because of my God,&rdquo; he said when he returned.
