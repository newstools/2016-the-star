County DCI boss Nicholas Kamwende has said fraud was committed during the sale of Mariakani estate for Sh1.4 billion.The estate, which was owned by the City Council, was transferred to the Local Authorities Pension Trust (Laptrust) fund in 2012 in a debt swap.Several reports tabled in the Nairobi County Assembly reveal the 10-acre Mariakani estate in South B was sold for Sh1.45 billion before the 2013 election.A re-evaluation in 2014 put the value of the property at Sh 1.9 billion.Kamwende has written to the chief land registrar at Ardhi House, saying investigations established there was fraud in the transaction.&ldquo;This is therefore to advise you to put a restriction on any other transaction on the property until the investigations are completed,&rdquo; Kamwende said in his October 13 letter.The letter follows a complaint by former town clerk and current Moyale MP Roba Duba, mentioned as a signatory in the transfer of the estate.Duba had complained to the DCI&rsquo;s office that his signature was forged.County secretary Robert Ayisi said ownership was transferred to Lapfund and Laptrust on April 3 at Sh1.45 billion in a debt swap arrangement.He said documents show City Hall did not receive cash.The arrangement was to settle statutory debts to Lapfund and Laptrust worth Sh5 billion.Documents indicate the 10.13-acre estate has 30 blocks of eight flats each, hence, 240 houses with three bedrooms each.The meeting to sell the estate was held on August 10, 2012, and was chaired by former councillor JAW Kassam.The city treasurer reported that according to the 1998 LATF Act, statutory debts were supposed to be paid by July 31, 2010.He said the Nairobi City Council was unable to meet the LATf conditionality but had only managed to clear with some of the statutory debts like NHIF and NSSF.The documents showed the money needed to be paid so that City Hall could obtain a clearance from Laptrust to receive LATF money in September 2012.The documents indicate the officials marked for transfer to Laptrust and Lapfund, Jamhuri estate, old and new Ngara estates, Jevanjee, Bachelors Quarters and Sunken Car park.The two then-acting assistant town clerks S Kudate and Lucy Maitai were ordered to enter into negotiations on how to clear the statutory debts in respect of Laptrust and Lapfund.
