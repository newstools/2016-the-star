The High Court has declined to nullify a gazette notice that allowed the Speaker to convene special parliamentary sittings on Thursday morning.Justice George Odunga declined to stop Parliament from discussing amendments to the election law saying there were no compelling reasons to issue an injunction or nullify the gazette notice.Odunga acknowledged that the case was important but said the opposition did not give reasons sufficient for the issuance of a temporary order against the sitting.He said he will look at the legality of the amendment during the substantial hearing of the case, after which the court will make a decision based on evidence submitted.Through lawyer James Orengo, Cord sought an injunction to quash the notice convening the two special sittings by Speaker Justin Muturi, saying it was published after the government's official working hours. The Oppositon MPs stormed out of Parliament on Thursday and marched to Milimani courts seeking orders to have the court stop the special sittings.They cited chaos in the National Assembly and alleged that some Jubilee MPs had carried guns into the assembly and were ready to attack them.This was as Parliament passed proposals by Jubilee MP and Majority leader Aden Duale proposing for MCA candidates to have a minimum of a degree by 2022.More on this: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election lawsAinabkoi MPSamuel Chpkonga had also proposed that the IEBC finds an alternative mechanism for identification and transmission of election resurrects in the event of technological failure.He had also proposed that all independent candidates submit names and photos they intend to use in the elections just like those who will be vying under different parties.The MPs also passed a law concerning Election Campaign Financing Act 2013. They sought to reduce the time by which persons ought to have opened mandatory bank accounts and registererd with the commission for the purpose of campaign financing.The period had been set as eight months.
