Equity Group maintained the most attractive position to investors among the 11 listed banks in September, a quarterly report that measures franchise and intrinsic value after every months suggested yesterday.The Cytonn Investments Banking Report for the third quarter shows Equity scored strong on franchise and intrinsic metrics.The franchise score measures the broad and comprehensive business strength of the company and the intrinsic score measures the return potential.State-owned National Bank ranked lowest in the survey. &ldquo;The report all listed banks in the Kenyan market so as to take a view on the banking sector to determine which banks are the most attractive for investors from a franchise value and future growth opportunity perspective,&rdquo; said Cytonn&rsquo;s chief investment officer Elizabeth Nkukuu.All but three banks maintained their positions from the first half banking report. KCB Group remained rooted at position two, Co-operative was third, I&amp;M holdings fourth, while Diamond Trust Bank came in fifth.Barclays Bank rose one position to sixth position due to its high net interest margin of 10.9 per cent.Stanbic Holdings rose one position to seventh, &ldquo;supported by a high intrinsic value score, high revenue diversification and the highest deposit mobilisation per branch of Sh5.2 billion&rdquo;.Standard Chartered Bank fell two positions to position eight, affected by a low franchise value score which was weighed down by high levels of non-performing loans. Its NPLs to total loans ratio was 12.2 per cent versus an industry average of 33.9 per cent, reflecting a deterioration in quality of the bank&rsquo;s loan book.&ldquo;As the banking sector continues to undergo transition, we believe that the industry will become more stable where only the banks with a strong competitive advantage, either in capitalisation, deposit gathering or niche shall remain, with the remaining banks forced to either merger or be acquired,&rdquo; Nkukuu said. Kenya&rsquo;s listed banks recorded improved earning per share growth of 15.1 per cent in quaerter three, compared to 9.7 per cent growth in 2015, the firm&rsquo;s survey shows.
