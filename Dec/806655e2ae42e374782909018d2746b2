Kisii assembly speaker Kerosi Ondieki yesterday rejected a gazette notice presented by an MCA during a special sitting to deliberate important matters.He said the notice, which was produced by Bokimonge MCA George Bibao, cannot be used to conduct business because it was downloaded from a website. &ldquo;What the MCA for Bokimonge has produced in the house is not a hard copy of the gazette notice because it was downloaded,&rdquo; Kerosi said.Kerosi had earlier adjourned the sittings to allow the House Business Committee to brainstorm on the matters to prioritise for discussion. The speaker said no business was to be transacted without the official gazette notice, which was filed in Nairobi by MCAs Samuel Apoko (Kiogoro) and Tabitha Okong&rsquo;o (nominated) on Tuesday. He said it was necessary that the original gazette notice be availed to the MCAs to see what type of issues it entailed, before deliberations commence. Bibao told the house that he sent his personal assistant to a cyber cafe to download the notice, because the House Business Committee members had difficulties in deciding which matters should be prioritised.Kerosi said the committee had consulted the Nairobi office and was informed that the hard copy of the gazette notice was to be ready by Thursday at 3pm. Marani MCA Dennis Ombachi said the issues in the gazette notice that was filed were more than what was expected to be discussed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m informing this house that the issues that were in the gazette notice were 17, four more than the ones that were to be discussed during the special sitting,&rdquo; he said. The speaker told the committees of trade, budget, public accounts, implementation and labour chairmen to prepare on the matters that were previously listed. Sengera Bosoti MCA Timothy Nyarang&rsquo;o said he does not understand why the speaker called them from recess if there was no business to be discussed. The house was adjourned to Friday at 9am.
