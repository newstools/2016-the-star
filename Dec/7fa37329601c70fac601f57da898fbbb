Water supply will be rationed in the city from January to April next year, as the Ndakaini dam level has dropped.Nairobi water company managing director Philip Gichuki said the drop resulted from law rainfall in the last three months."The city consumes about 550,000 cubic meters daily but will onwards get about 462,000 cubic meters. The changes will help the company ration water [and carry out reviews every two weeks," he said.Gichuki said they had expected that rains in the second season of the year would fill the dam."It is worth noting that long rains stopped in the first week of May as opposed to mid June as experienced in previous years," he said on Monday."This means the recharge of the rivers has been poor. The flows are below normal affecting the recharge of Ndakaini dam which is currently 48 per cent full." The MD urged residents to cooperate with the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company during the period by avoiding wastage.The United Nations warned Kenya about a worsening drought in 2017, in a statement on December 13.People and animals' lives are at risk because they have not had a chance to recover from drought in 2014 as rains were also poor in 2015 and 2016, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said."We really are concerned that the situation is going to deteriorate rapidly early into next year," Piers Simpkin, a livestock expert with FAO in Kenya, told a news conference. "There is serious drought looming in early 2017."More on this: Expect serious drought early in 2017, UN warns Kenya
