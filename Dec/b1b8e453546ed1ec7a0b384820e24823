Patients have snubbed the Lamu county hospital and opted for private facilities, despite nurses at the hospital being at work.On Monday, after a meeting with county health officials, nurses in Lamu announced that they would not take part in the strike and have continued with their normal duties at various hospitals and dispensaries.However, no single patient have gone to King Fahad County Hospital since Monday, in what the medical staff suspect could be a situation of &lsquo;self denial&rsquo; following media reports of the nationwide medical practitioners' strike.Nurses said patients might be avoiding the hospital for fear of being mishandled or abandoned like in other counties. The media has reported patients being abandoned in in various public hospitals countrywide.The nurses said they are ready attend to patients and urged residents to seek medical services at the hospital.However, some nurses accused their county union leaders of abandoning them and failing to communicate clearly, especially concerning the ongoing strike.The nurses said the officials had simply told them not to partake in the strike and had vanished shortly after without any updates.&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t just tell us not to take part in the strike and disappear. We can&rsquo;t go on like this. Inasmuch as we haven&rsquo;t joined the strike, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they should hide in silence. They need to be closer to us now and update us on everything," said a nurse who requested anonymity."No one is talking. We have been left at crossroads. They must come out and speak. We don&rsquo;t want a situation of double standards,&rdquo; the medic added.
