The markets have ratcheted crude oil over seven per cent higher ahead of the official Opec pronouncement later today in Vienna, as I file this report. This might well prove a Buy the Rumour Sell the Fact situation. Kenya s inflation rate edged up to 6.68 per cent year-on-year in November from 6.47 per cent in October, the statistics office said on Monday.The shilling was last trading at 101.80 and has lived up to its Teflon Shilling billing.The Nairobi All Share eked out a 0.06 point gain to close at 136.61. The Nairobi NSE20 closed -9.39 points to close at 3247.19. Equity turnover clocked 875.665 million.Safaricom firmed +0.251 per cent to close at 19.90 and saw good volume of action of 24.811 million shares worth Sh494.738million. Safaricom is well underpinned at these levels. H1 16 profit after tax accelerated +30.6 per cent and justifies a substantially higher price, in my opinion. KCB Group traded 3.164 million shares and closed -0.83 per cent easier at 30.00. Tier 1 bank stocks are set to outperform in the new post rate capping normal. Equity Group s CEO James Mwangi has been on an aggressive engagement with the diaspora and was last in Johannesburg. Equity closed unchanged at Sh30.00 and traded 2.596million shares. EABL eased back -0.4 per cent to close at Sh248.00 and traded 427,700 shares. EABL is oversold. ARM eased back -3.84per cent to close at Sh25.00 and traded shares as low as Sh24.00 -7.69 per cent at the closing bell. ARM traded 1.055 million shares and I surmise that today s downdraft was triggered by the news out of Tanzania that Dangote Cement (a $600m cement plant in Mtwara with a capacity to produce 3.0 million tonnes of cement a year) had stopped operations. Informed chatter is that the Tanzania government is unhappy that Dangote has been shipping in coal from South Africa. Dangote s CEO in Tanzania Harpreet Duggal, said the temporary stoppage was caused by a technical problem in the plant s units, which is not critical. ARM has a facility in Tanga and I suspect the Dangote news led ARM to the downside today. EA Portland Cement was high-ticked +10.00 per cent to close at Sh22.00 and traded just 400 shares. East Africa Portland Cement is -52.94 per cent through 2016. BAT traded 14,900 shares all at 850.00 +2.41 per cent. BAT is +15.03 per cent in 2016 and is a solid dividend payer and in this environment of relatively benign interest rates, Investors will be reaching for the BAT yield. KenolKobil rose +0.33 per cent to close at Sh15.00 and traded 1.384million shares. Aly-Khan is a financial analyst
