Education CS Fred Matiang'i surprised the country with the release of KCPE results on Thursday, a week earlier than the expected December 8 date.He briefed President Uhuru Kenyatta before going to the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development where the results will be announced.The class eight exam results are always released before New Year and KCSE in March.A total of 952,472 candidates sat the exam at 26,308 centres from November 1-3.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said he was not informed that the results would be announced today."This is a surprise. We have learned this from the media. We didn t know the results were going to be released today," he told journalists.But Sossion noted the new "best practice" was welcome and that "students will report to school earlier thus ensuring they settle in quickly.""The earlier the results are released, the better, so candidates can prepare themselves for the next step.The cohorts will be more prepared and are likely to perform better," he said.Matiang'i met Uhuru alongside Knec chairman George Magoha, Education PS Belio Kipsang, Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia and Knec's Mercy Karogo.The government said KCSE candidates should expect their results by December 2016.
