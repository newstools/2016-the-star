A private school in Githunguri, Kiambu, has urged wellwishers to help its top scorers join secondary school.Wanjo Day and Boarding Primary School enrols children between standard four and eight from poor backgrounds. It is funded by wellwishers, who only pay for the pupils&rsquo; upkeep while they are at the school. Pupils get no further assistance when joining Form One. Proprietor Jane Nyambura said, &ldquo;It is a major problem since the school has no money to cater for the orphans or from very poor homes.&rdquo;Top candidate Florence Nyambura scored 404 marks in the KCPE exam. Jane said her mother only doe menial jobs and cannot support her child&rsquo;s secondary education. &ldquo;I am grateful to Wanjo for giving me the opportunity to learn. Now I appeal to wellwishers to help me join Form One,&rdquo; Florence said.
