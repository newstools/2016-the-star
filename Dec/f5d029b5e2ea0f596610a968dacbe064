It is despicable to use the death of former Kitui Mayor Martha Mwangangi to salvage their political careers, Governor Julius Malombe has said. &ldquo;It is very unfortunate that politicians with interests in various political elective positions have hijacked this tragedy for political mileage,&rdquo; he said in a statement on Tuesday.Mwangangi was crushed by a county fire engine on Friday last week when she and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu joined traders to protest against demolition of kiosks. Ngilu was quoted in the media saying she was the target. &ldquo;This is completely inappropriate, immoral and self-serving. It should not happen in decent societies,&rdquo; Malombe said. Ngilu has said the governor should take responsibility for Mwangangi's death. She is challenging Malombe for the governor post next year. But Malombe said authorities are investigating and called for patience and empathy. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that certain politicians []are using] the unforeseen and unfortunate death on Mwangangi to further [their] political agenda, in total disregard to the emotional distress occasioned to the family of the deceased,&rdquo; he said. He sent his heartfelt sympathies and condolences to Mwangangi's family. &ldquo;My thoughts and prayers are with her family during this trying time,&rdquo; reads the statement.[VIDEO] Ngilu survives as Kitui ex-mayor is crushed to death by fire engine
