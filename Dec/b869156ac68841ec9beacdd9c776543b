Customarily, when dominant parties in mature democracies swap power after an election, one can generally predict the direction of the country policy-wise, given the victorious party&rsquo;s ideology. Thus, if the winning party is liberal, one can expect a government friendly to the needs of the underprivileged and the middle-class.If, on the other hand, the winning party is conservative, one can expect a government hostile to the same groups but friendly to the rich.This is because the winning party is usually led by someone who tows the party line in both ideology and application.This year marks the first time in American history where the winning party in a presidential election is led by someone who owes the party no loyalty neither one who ascribes fully to the party&rsquo;s ideology. Making the situation even more fascinating, the President-elect is someone who has been a life-long member and supporter of the losing party and one, if life depended on it, would readily admit he&rsquo;s more aligned with the ideology of the losing party than the one he won the elections under its banner. This leads to the question many have been asking and continue to, what kind of President will Donald Trump be?The short answer is, nobody knows.That doesn&rsquo;t mean people won&rsquo;t try and scramble to make some sense of this presidency: They will and are.A few days ago, for example, the Wilson Center &mdash; a top think-tank in Washington &mdash; hosted a conference call in which two experts on African affairs were invited to share their views on what they believe a Trump presidency means to Africa.Before kicking off the conference call, the moderator noted a number of things that everyone agrees to and these are, one, discussion of Africa was largely absent during the US presidential campaign, other than Bhengazi &mdash; used as a noose to hang Clinton &mdash; two, Trump has yet to lay out any plan for Africa, three, there has been continuity of policy in the past three US administrations when it comes to Africa, different only in the scope of implementation and fourth, the US has always had a &ldquo;one-size-fit all&rdquo; policy toward Africa that doesn&rsquo;t work.One of the experts, Dr Fatima Sadiq, speaking on the reaction in North Africa, and the Muslim world for that matter, noted the reaction has been mixed: Countries led by populists have been happy while those led by democratic parties have been shocked with the overall general sense being surprise and apprehension.In her view, nobody knows how the Trump presidency will impact this region, especially given how Trump&rsquo;s attacks on Muslims was uniformly condemned in the Muslim world while being used for propaganda purposes by terrorists. Dr Sadiq feared human rights, especially women rights will suffer a setback.Dr Terrence McNamee, the other expert on the CC speaking on the reaction in the rest of Africa noted that until Trump appoints his Secretary of State, not much can be determined about the direction his administration will take on Africa.However, McNamara believes Africa will be on the lowest end of Trump&rsquo;s priorities around the globe because he is &ldquo;oblivious and ignorant about Africa.&rdquo;In McNamara&rsquo;s view, Trump will either take a hardline position on Africa leading to more militarisation of the continent, or he may just be content with ignoring the continent but allowing the existing aid organs such as the USAID more autonomy in guiding social and political change while focusing on business much like China does.Overall, McNamara is of the view that none other than African dictators and others elected under dubious circumstances are gleeful with the election of Trump because they can point to his election and say, &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s not only in Africa people who don&rsquo;t win the popular votes are elected President: The US too does the same thing. So ignore their lectures about democratic elections blah, blah&rdquo; &mdash; to paraphrase what the good doctor said.That sentiment doesn&rsquo;t bode well for democracy in Africa.The writer is a legal expert and political commentator based in the United States.
