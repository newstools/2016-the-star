Hundreds of hired goons pretending to be suppliers and contractors on Tuesday stormed the Kisumu county assembly demanding payment.They were not armed and they asked to talk to speaker Ann Adul.They engaged police in running battles before they were dispersed by the Quick Response Team.County police commander Titus Yoma said no one was injured and no arrest has been made. &ldquo;We appeal to residents to refrain from unlawful acts and follow due process whenever they have grievances,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone on Tuesday.On Monday, Adul denied claims she refused to sign documents passed in the assembly to enable contractors get paid. She said she does not know who gave contractors such information.This was after legitimate contractors stormed her office, demanding to know why the supplementary budget had not been signed and forwarded to the executive to facilitate their payment. They want Sh2.5 billion.The more than 100 contractors led by Thomas Otieno entered the assembly and demanded to speak with Adul. They were blocked by the serjeant-at-arms and two police officers from accessing the speaker&rsquo;s office. They were later allowed to pick representatives to speak with Adul.They demanded an explanation on how their dues amounting to millions of shillings would be paid by the county government. &ldquo;I was surprised when they told me that someone from the executive told them that I had refused to sign a document to enable the executive release their funds,&rdquo; Adul said.Adul said the delay has been caused by the executive. &ldquo;We are not to blame because we also sympathise with the contractors, but the executive did not specify some of the items they placed in the supplementary budget,&rdquo; she said.Last week, MCAs approved a Sh717 million supplementary budget for 2016-17, four months after the county budget was passed. In the supplementary budget, the contractors will be paid Sh482.8 million for completed projects and another Sh72.1 million for roads maintenance.
