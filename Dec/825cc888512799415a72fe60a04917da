The High court on Tuesday declined to stop parliament from debating the contentious amendment of 2017 Electoral Laws.Justice George Odunga, in a ruling said it was within the right of the national assembly to discuss the matter which he said is of public interest.&ldquo;In this case, am not satisfied that parliament is due to engage in unconstitutional debate for me to grant orders gagging it from carrying its mandate,&rdquo; the judge said.Read: [VIDEO] Parliament buildings blockaded by police, MPs forced to walk ahead of IEBC sittingJustice Odunga was ruling in a petition filed by Mugambi Imanyara and Collins Kipchumba Tallam who wants the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016 nullified on grounds that it has provisions which infringe on the voters&rsquo; constitutional rights to vote, by recognising only the biometric voter identification and electronic transmission of results.Read: MPs meet to change election law, Raila rejectsThe judge instead suspended the hearing of the case to allow parliament carry out its mandate.He said the matter will be revisited on January 19 when the suit will come up for further directions.&ldquo;I have considered the foregoing, it&rsquo;s clear that both the judiciary and parliament have a legislative mandate which belongs to the people of Kenya. Parliament may or may not resolve the contentious issues but there is no point for the court to deal with the same now&rdquo; he said.Also read: Cord gets orders suspending supply of 2017 election ballot papersCord and Jubilee Party are interested parties in the case.Cord through Lawyer Apollo Mboya, has said that the contested law was rightfully passed following an all inclusive negotiated process and any amendments to it must follow the same process.But in an affidavit, the Jubilee Party through Secretary General Veronica Maina states that the amendments made to the electoral laws have the real and present danger of delaying, disrupting and undermining the electoral process.The party&rsquo;s contention is that 10 per cent of the country has no network coverage and that only 17 per cent of the country has 3G network coverage.According to her, there should be manual process to back-up the process in case there is failure in the electronic transmission of results.
