Chief Justice David Maraga has demanded that National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale stop the "public lynching" of judges who are merely performing their constitutional duties.Duale accused High Court Judge Justice Odunga of being partisan and said he would file a motion on his conduct.In his ruling on a legal challenge by the opposition on the proposed amendments to Election Laws, Odunga said nothing could stop the court from reversing any decisions that will be made by Parliament.Jubilee MPs forcefully passed the amendments to the electoral law in the National Assembly, which Cord has strongly opposed.Maraga said in Odunga's defence: "I strongly condemn the utterances and threats of Duale which fly in the face of the rule of law and civil conduct of leaders of a constitutional democracy such as Kenya."In a statement on Thursday, he added that the remarks affected the judiciary's independence."Odunga has been a major factor in the transformation of Kenya's judiciary, and the international respect and acclaim the institution has continued to draw, has been in part contributed by [his] decisions and conduct," he said.The CJ said judges will neither be intimidated nor blackmailed, whether as individuals or an institution, under his leadership."This is what we owe the Kenyan public, as well as to our oaths of office," he said."I believe in the principle of interdependence and collaboration... but only if... within the framework of mutual respect, constitutionalism and engagement."Members of the opposition, led by Cord chief Raila Odinga, have now called for mass protests January 4, 2017, to protest passing of amended electoral laws.Read: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election lawsAlso read: LSK condemns Duale attack on judge George OdungaDuale alleged on Wednesday that Raila was afraid of the August 8, 2017 general elections.The majority leader, who is Garissa Town MP, said this is why the ODM leader is claiming there will be no election if the law on technology back up is passed.Raila accused Jubilee government of coercing opposition MPs to amend the election laws in parliament.He said opposition MPs will not allow any amendment proposed by the Jubilee side.More on this: Raila is scared of elections, Duale states
