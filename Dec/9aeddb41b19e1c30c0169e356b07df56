Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is a daydreamer who should get ready for a fierce battle in the 2017 general election, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro has said.Mung'aro said this on Wednesday in response to Joho's declaration that Jubilee Party will not win any seats at the Coast.The Governor said the region's six counties were opposition strongholds and that any leader who decamped to Jubilee will fall in the August 8 poll.Read: JP will not win any seat at the Coast, says JohoBut the MP said: "Tell Joho that he is daydreaming. He does not own Coast. He does not have the votes of the people in his pockets."Dreaming about Coast people being in the opposition their whole lives is just daydreaming."The legislator, who is the former Coast parliamentary group chairman, told the Star by phone that Joho should prepare to lose his seat as they will "enter Mombasa in a big way".Mung'aro, who is also ODM's minority chief whip, has long been in a supremacy battle with the Governor over the region&rsquo;s kingship.&ldquo;We are not going to sit and encourage our people to vote for the opposition. People go to the elections to form the government, not to to be in the opposition," he said.He added that the intention is for Coast to get a place in government and seats with key decision makers.The MP further said Joho's announcement that the Coast will vote for the opposition was only a clear indication that President Uhuru Kenyatta will continue to rule."Saying Jubilee will not get any seat in Coast is like taking the region for granted," he added.He told Joho to first state his constituency before announcing that Coast will not vote for Jubilee.Mung&rsquo;aro reminded the region's residents that at the time of the coalition government, ODM was in charge of so many ministries but did not help them achieve anything.He gave examples of the lands, water, roads, agriculture, public service, immigration and industrialisation ministries.&ldquo;In the last three years, and based on my association with the Jubilee government, you can see the changes that are taking place. Roads are being built and water and electricity are being supplied," he said.Read: Land question dominates Uhuru, Ruto Coast ralliesAlso read: Uhuru commends Coast leaders for working with JubileeThe MP also told off Joho for saying the Jubilee administration was made up of thieves.The "thieves" have delivered while the "real thieves" did nothing during the Grand Coalition Government, he said.Mung'aro further told the Governor to forget about the six-piece vote in Coast, as was the case in 2007 and 2012.&ldquo;Everybody will show their numbers. We are tired of being cheated, For a leader who is focused he should be frank and think of forming the next government,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Read: Campaigns, project launches leave Uhuru with 2 days rest in DecemberAlso read: Uhuru&rsquo;s big Coast projects threaten Cord&rsquo;s dominance
