Narok has prepared a bill that seeks to resolve environmental problems by reducing pollution, conserving forests and managing waste properly.Environment chief executive Rebecca Nkowua said charcoal burning is a big problem and has contributed to the high rate of forest depletion. But with the passage of the Environment Bill, this will end, she said.&ldquo;Last year, our efforts to ban charcoal burning were hampered by the lack of a legal document to back the move. The Bill will now provide this,&rdquo; she said yesterday during a stakeholders&rsquo; meeting in Nakuru.Nkowua said the county is one of the largest producers of charcoal. She blamed deforestation in the Mau Complex on this. The Environment Bill proposes stiffer penalties for offenders found engaging in the charcoal business without a valid permit or licence.The Bill states, &ldquo;If a person is found in possession of charcoal without a licence, he or she is liable to conviction to a fine of not less than Sh50,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year.&rdquo;Nkowua said they will develop a charcoal policy to regulate the sector, adding that much of the forest destruction is not done by the Maasais as they are predominantly pastoralists, but by outsiders living in the county.&ldquo;If we want to keep the Masai Mara, a significant tourist attraction, we&rsquo;ve to conserve our environment,&rdquo; she said. The Bill is supported by the UNDP and the Green Africa Foundation.
