Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok yesterday said he is working hard to ensure residents enjoy the fruits of devolution and he deserves a second term. Speaking in Moi Gardens, Lodwar, he mentioned a number of projects his administration has initiated. Nanok said devolution has improved residents&rsquo; living standards and fostered unity. &ldquo;Devolution has empowered the counties to manage their resources. We, therefore, celebrate it as second Independence,&rdquo; he said. Nanok said his administration is keen to make water available to residents by drilling 60 boreholes, two in every ward. He said this is ongoing. The county boss said the county has recruited 413 health workers to &ldquo;bring services closer to the people&rdquo;. He said there is ongoing construction of doctors&rsquo; housing units, an Intensive Care Unit and High Dependency Unit. Nanok said in a few weeks, Lodwar will have a fire brigade to boost the county&rsquo;s disaster preparedness.
