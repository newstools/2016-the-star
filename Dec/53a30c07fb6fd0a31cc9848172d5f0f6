Last week, they wrote a petition to CS Jacob Kaimenyi asking him to take action against staffers who have been in a station for more than three years.They said the staffers who have overstayed at the headquarters have formed cartels that are now slowing down the provision of services and are hiding files.The disgruntled workers alleged that some senior staffers with godfathers have flatly refused to go on transfers and say they will not leave Ardhi House."We the ministry members of staff wish to append here below some names of staff who have stayed in one particular work station for a period between 5-15 years," the petition says.According to the petition, some of the officers who have been named are Salome Wanjiku, the senior registrar of documents whom they said has been at the documents registration office since 1987.Virginia Gichuru has also been at the same department since 1985, Onesmus Ngombo, a senior clerical officer, has been at the headquarters since 1986 and lands registration officer Sarah Maina is said to have been at the headquarters for more than 10 years.The Lands ministry has been accused as a beehive of corruption as some officers have been linked to a cartel that hide files and use brokers to solicit money from Kenyans following up on their land matters.Efforts to reach some of the accused officers were unsuccessful, as they refused to comment on the matter.
