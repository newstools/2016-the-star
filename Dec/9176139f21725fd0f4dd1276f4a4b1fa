Msambweni Referral Hospital and other subcounty facilities in Kwale have been closed, with only a few anguished patients left behind. Medical personnel are on a nationwide strike since Monday. All patients admitted at the facility were discharged on Monday apart from a few who had undergone surgery, a guard, who did not wish to be identified, said.At the surgical ward, the Star reporter found 17 men in great pain with metals stuck in their legs. There were also three wounded children and two women lying helplessly. Shee Mwacharo, who underwent renal surgery on Saturday, is among those left behind at the hospital.&ldquo;We cannot go home because of his condition. When other patients were discharged, we decided to remain behind as there was no way that we could have taken our uncle home with pipes tied around him,&rdquo; his nephew Salim Mwatsaro said. Lucas, another patient, has been waiting for more than a month to be operated on. &ldquo;We have been waiting all long but now the strike has [stopped his surgery],&rdquo; relative Slyvia Musia said. He was involved in an accident and a metal bar was wrongly attached to his leg at a Busia hospital. He was to undergo corrective surgery.
