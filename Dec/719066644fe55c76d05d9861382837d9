Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero yesterday faulted the auditor general&rsquo;s report showing the county could not account for more than Sh20 billion in 2014-15.Kidero said the report by Edward Ouko is &ldquo;alarming, untrue and does not contain any element of truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;If Sh20 billion disappeared out of a revenue of Sh23 billion (the county&rsquo;s budget in 2014-15 ) then we would only have had Sh3 billion to pay salaries, which is about Sh18 billion a year,&rdquo; he said.Kidero said the county has a wage bill of more than Sh1 billion a month and recurrent expenditure of Sh6 billion a year (salary excluded). Therefore it could not have operated on Sh3 billion during the year, he says.&ldquo;In the same year, same report, it shows we spent Sh8 billion in capital expenditure. So it is not feasible,&rdquo; he said.The city boss cited Sh437 million spent on the installation of traffic lights and CCTV cameras in the CBD. The auditor questioned how the money was paid to Nanjing Les Information Technology for non-functioning surveillance.He said the national government undertook the project, but the auditor erroneously dragged the county&rsquo;s name into it. Kidero said the cameras are functioning, contrary to the report. &ldquo;When [former Kabete MP] George Muchai was murdered on Kenyatta Avenue, the police used the footage from the same cameras to arrest the suspects,&rdquo; he said.The governor faulted the auditor for saying the Sh3.9 million borehole drilled at Pumwani Maternity Hospital is not working. &ldquo;This hospital has not had any water, that is why the number of children and mothers dying had increased. Today, the numbers have gone down, and if anybody dares to go to Pumwani, they will see the borehole is working,&rdquo; he said.
