Conservationists have urged the national environment agency to be ready for legal battles if it allows the SGR to cut through the Nairobi National Park.Africa Network for Animal Welfare legal officer Wachira Kariuki on Thursday last week said there has been no public participation in the matter.He said procedures were not followed when the Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted.&ldquo;The procedure was not adhered to and if you go ahead and issue a licence for the project to start, we will challenge you in court,&rdquo; Wachira told the National Environment Management Authority director general Geoffrey Wahungu. Wachira said a project whose impact on the environment is dire cannot start without a permit. The community around the railway line accused Wahungu and Kenya Railways MD Atanas Maina of not involving them in the project.&ldquo;A lot of dust is a major issue of concern. This is because there is no license showing how this can be mitigated,&rdquo;Wachira said. Wahungu said Nema will make decision about the project soon.
