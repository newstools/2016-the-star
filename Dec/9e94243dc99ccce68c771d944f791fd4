A Ugandan house help was arrested on Wednesday in Kiambu as she attempted to flee with her employer&rsquo;s three-year-old daughter. Elizabeth Mumbi, the child&rsquo;s mother, said a neighbour called her at work to ask whether she was moving house.She told Mumbi her housekeeper was removing household items from her house. &ldquo;My house help had carried my child and suitcases with their clothes in them,&rdquo; Mumbi said.The neighbour, name not given, felt something was amiss when she met the house help and asked her where she was going. She then called Mumbi.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s by God&rsquo;s grace that my neighbour met her. She was almost a kilometre away from my house,&rdquo; Mumbi said. The neighbour also called area chief and alerted other neighbours, who took the house help back to her employer&rsquo;s house.
