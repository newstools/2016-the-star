There are some easy and effortless ways of losing elections, as Gor Mahia chairmanship aspirant Dan Oketch has discovered - at a huge cost. He was doing very well and was sure to unseat long-serving chairman Ambrose Rachier. That was until Dan&rsquo;s very close friend and staunch Kogallo fan, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (pictured), went on air on Radio Jambo to publicly endorse and campaign for him. And, just like that, Rachier trounced Oketch with 597 votes against 220. Lesson learnt and in former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile&rsquo;s maxim, &ldquo;when some people speak in your favour, majority votes are lost&rdquo;.***********Five members of the dreaded criminal &lsquo;Superpower&rsquo; gang that has been terrorising Eastlands residents have gone into hiding after their leader was shot and killed by police in Eastleigh Section Three&rsquo;s Biafra area last week. The gang, armed with a Tokalev pistol and pangas, had robbed a resident of money and a mobile phone before newly posted police led by the Shauri Moyo OCS confronted and shot the gang leader dead. The gang members are reported to be contemplating relocating to South C to avoid the police crackdown in Eastlands.************The Special Programmes department officials are contemplating using three companies that have been diligently supplying relief food on time, despite delayed payments as the department grapples with a reduced budget. A little bird whispers that, despite being owed millions of shillings, the three companies have continued to deliver rice, beans, maize and other foodstuffs for disaster and flood victims on time. Five other companies have been delivering substandard food that is often rejected by quality inspectors. ************ Mogotio politics is about to take a dramatic turn for the worse for incumbent MP Hellen Sambili, with the expected entry of a serious candidate fronted by the youth and professionals. The young man, a former personal assistant to a minister and currently closely attached to a senior Jubilee leader famed for getting jobs for Baringo youth, is enigmatically nicknamed Pope. Elders have arranged meetings to interview him and make Mogotio a two-horse race for the Jubilee nomination slot.*************Two governors from the North Rift are not seeing eye-to-eye with one of their coalition leaders due to the positions they have taken against corruption in the region. The two leaders, who Corridors understand were summoned and given a tongue-lashing over their stand, are willing to put their careers on the line even if it means going separate ways with the coalition at the elections. Though they have been on the frontline supporting their boss, they are now contemplating using alternative political outfits from the region to defend their seats.
