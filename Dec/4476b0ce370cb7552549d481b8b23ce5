Borabu MP Ben Momanyi has said City Hall owes him more than Sh1 billion, despite the Auditor General questioning Sh60 million paid to his law firm.&ldquo;Nairobi county owes my law firm in excess of Sh1 billion. If I&rsquo;m doing my work as a lawyer and my people are working, I have to look for work too and I must be paid for it. Let us keep off petty politics,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I even told them [media] to put it in the headlines so the people of Borabu know their MP is rich.&rdquo; Momanyi urged his opponents to look for more than Sh100 million if they want to remove him. The MP was responding to activist Okiya Omtatah&rsquo;s letter to Nairobi county, questioning payments made to his law firm in the 2014-15 financial year. Momanyi spoke during the burial of Julius Atei in Kineni village. Lawyer Stephen Mogaka, who wants to be West Mugirango MP, defended him, saying he runs a successful law firm. &ldquo;If the Auditor General does not know why Momanyi and Associates law firm is popular, let him ask for documents. We should not question why he is being paid Sh60 million, then put it in newspapers,&rdquo; he said.
