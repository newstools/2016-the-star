The Luhya are not ready to produce the President next year and even their two leaders who have declared their interest in the position are only popular in Western, not countrywide, Mukhisa Kituyi has said. The two presidential hopefuls &mdash; Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula &mdash; are &ldquo;just mere jokers running around here&rdquo; Kituyi said. &ldquo;Their popularity is not being felt countrywide,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are only remaining with a very short time to election and we are not seeing any seriousness in our brothers.&rdquo; He said the battle for the presidency is no walk in the park. Kituyi, a Luhya, is the secretary general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development. The former Trade minister and Kimilili MP was a close ally of Mudavadi in 2013. Kituyi spoke on Saturday during the burial of former chief Solomon Karani in Naitiri village. Corruption is taking root in the country, yet leaders are only busy with politics and blame games, he said. &ldquo;If leaders from Cord and Jubilee do not join hands and fight corruption, then this country is going to lag in development,&rdquo; Kituyi said.
