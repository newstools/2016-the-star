A cleric at Ol Kalou yesterday urged the National Assembly to make a law criminalising strikes and picketing by medical practitioners.Bishop Francis Karara of the Holy Temple of Christ said although doctors and nurses have the right to go on strike, it amounts to murder, which is a criminal offence.He said it is wrong for the health workers to go to the streets, leaving patients to their own devices.Karara spoke in Ol Kalou town. He said the right to live is sacred and there is no need to demand a pay rise when people are dying. Karara said patients have the right to quality healthcare, which includes getting medical attention from health workers.He criticised the national and county governments for appearing helpless, as the nationwide strike takes a heavy toll on Kenyans. The cleric told off Jubilee and Cord from politicising the problem.He said although the medics will eventually be granted their demands, those who die during the strike will not be brought back to life.&ldquo;This is in total contravention of God&rsquo;s commandment against killing. Some of these medics, including those claiming to be born-again Christians, will not go to heaven,&rdquo; Karara said.He blamed the Constitution for Kenya&rsquo;s problems, as it grants everyone rights, &ldquo;some of which are unrealistic&rdquo;.&ldquo;What if the police and other armed forces are also allowed to strike? What would happen then?&rdquo; Karara said.He said the medics did not exhaust all the available avenues for negotiation with relevant authorities.&ldquo;This is why there ought to be a law criminalising such acts of negligence by people entrusted to save lives,&rdquo; he said.
