ODM has said it will not relent in the ongoing clean-up of its troops ahead of the general election.Treasurer Timothy Bosire yesterday warned rebels they will be swept aside in the internal reorganisation as the party seeks to put its house in order eight months to the polls.He said the party will crack the whip on more errant members soon.&ldquo;ODM is committed to taking over leadership of this country, hence the reorganisation to ensure only committed soldiers remain,&rdquo; Bosire said at Parliament Buildings.He went on,&ldquo;People with divided loyalty cannot be trusted to walk this path.&rdquo;The Kitutu Masaba MP urged the registrar of political parties to notify the speakers of the national and county assemblies of the decision to deregister 10 rebel members recommended for expulsion.Once this is done, the seats of the affected members will be declared vacant, and by-elections ordered even as parties race against time to reposition themselves.&ldquo;Jubilee has failed in every sector, everything and anything. We cannot allow a few selfish members to derail our course to take over power and revamp the economy,&rdquo; he said.Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, and Nairobi&rsquo;s Viwandani MCA Sam Nyangwara are among those expelled from ODM.The MPs are Stephen Kariuki (Mathare), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), Samuel Arama (Nakuru West), Ababu Namwamba (Budalang&rsquo;i), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni), John Waluke (Sirisia) and Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga.
