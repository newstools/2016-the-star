Medicine and equipment worth more than Sh1 billion were destroyed on Wednesday night when fire razed the Ministry of Health depot in Garissa.The fire started at 3pm and spread rapidly. It took firefighters and the military six hours to put it out. KDF came to the rescue after fire engines ran out of water.Health executive Hubie Hussein said an electrical fault may have been the cause. She said the depot at the public health offices in Garissa town had been recently stocked with supplies from donors. Supplies included baby weighing scales, beds and drugs from Unicef and WHO. Also destroyed were vaccines for Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties, computers, furniture, refrigerators, registers and recording equipment.Hussein said it was sad the county and subcounty supplies had not been distributed. Health chief officer Sophia Mohamed said a team from the vaccine and immunisation division is in town to assess the damage and ensure that crucial vaccines do not run out.Counties are already grappling with the doctors&rsquo; countrywide strike, which enters its 12th day today. Nurses called off their strike on Wednesday and returned to work. Last week, Hussein said the county was negotiating with doctors from Amref, the military, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Red Cross and the UNHCR to provide services as the doctors&rsquo; strike continues.
