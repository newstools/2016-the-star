Controversial Kenya Film Board censor Ezekiel Mutua yesterday said foreign NGOs supporting gay rights are plotting with evil people in the media to bring him down.Yesterday the CEO said NGOs bankrolling lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people oppose the board s efforts to regulate content and instil moral values. Some evil men and women holding key positions in the media houses have even discussed how I should be removed from the KFCB or even physically eliminated because I m a threat to media business, he said on his official Facebook page. He did not identify the NGOs and media houses.The controversial CEO said mainstream media houses have in the recent months deliberately twisted his messages and published skewed information and outright lies about him and the board. Mutua says large sums of money are being wired to bloggers to unleash all manner of filth against him. I serve a living God and he will sort you one by one, he said.Mutua says there are plans to run a series of commentaries on television, radio, in newspapers and blogs maligning him and the board. He said there have been more than 10 negative, unbalanced and inaccurate articles about them.He said the initial plan was to protray him as an ambitious political aspirant using a public office for self-promotion before the polls. On Friday last week, he announced that various interested parties had found common ground on the need to amend some laws.The Board wants the Stage Plays Act 2012 amended to help develop the industry, protect children, national values and rights .Under the new raft of proposals, scripts will have to be submitted to the board for vetting, accompanied by ads and communication materials for the planned production.There are fears of censorship.
