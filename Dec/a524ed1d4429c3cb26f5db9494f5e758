Politicians allied to Jubilee Party have accused the opposition of planning to cause chaos in 2017, after leader Raila Odinga and others skipped a leadership summit in Kwale.Kwale woman representative Zainab Chizuga said Raila's team may be planning to plunge the country into violence.Chidzuga said the public should shun the leaders who did not attend the Kepsa summit that discussed cohesion and peace ahead of the general election. We are worried, as women and children of this country, if Raila can boycott a summit to discuss peace issues ahead," she said at Leisure Lodge on Friday."He might be planning to get people, especially at the Coast, to the Kaya Bombo time, when our people were killed."She noted that Kwale county was most affected during the violence in 1997 and that the hotel industry lay off innocent youths.A similar scenario must be avoided at all costs, she said.[Statement]: Raila snubs Kepsa summit, cites bias for JubileeJubilee's coast pointman and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro said Coast's hotel industry has suffered a lot due to the violence that year. If your village is meeting to discuss peace and you decide to to to the farm, it means you are not peaceful, he said.Mung aro criticised Cord MPs and Senators who refused to attend the meeting despite flying from Nairobi and getting allowances.He said it was wrong for the opposition to politicise issues to do with peace and the private sector's stability, as it employs most of the youths at the Coast.Kieni MP Kanini Kega wondered how Cord could reject dialogue on a peaceful election if it was not planning to cause chaos. We have seen the challenges of post-election violence... The forum was a good platform to ensure a peaceful election... In fact, Raila should apologise to Kenyans for boycotting such an important event, he said.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi echoed their sentiments saying it was important for stakeholders to reason together despite their disagreements."Conversations world-over are beneficial especially on election processes. Any leader who does not see the value in that, I believe, might be headed in a direction that is not desirable for this country, he said.Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua said the summit should not be the last as there is need for the opposition and the government to discuss the election.Read: Karua dumps Raila for Uhuru ahead of Kirinyaga governor raceAlso read: Karua meets 'friend and colleague' Raila after dumping CordBut Senator Juma Boy and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, who were seen at the lodges but did not attend the conference, assured Kenyans that they were not planning any chaos. I assure Kenyans that nothing like that is being planned. It is only that Kepsa did not involve Cord as a stakeholder in planning the summit, like it did Jubilee, said Boy.
