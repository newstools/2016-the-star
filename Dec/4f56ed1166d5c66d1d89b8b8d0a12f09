Kilifi county will take a little longer to recover from the famine ravaging some parts of the country, despite rainfall in some regions, Kenya Red Cross Society Coast coordinator Hassan Musa has said.A survey conducted by the KRCS indicated many families will continue to depend on relief food between the time they plant and get their harvest.Musa said the situation is now dire, with the number of people in need of help increasing to more than 200,000 in Kilifi county.He spoke yesterday while distributing food to more than 20,000 people in Kadzadani sublocation, Magarini constituency.The Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies have urged well-wishers and NGOs to help in alleviating the suffering of the residents. Some families have lost their property after migrating to far-flung areas in search of food. Musa said Bamba, Ganze and Magazine are the hardest hit. Apart from giving relief, the Kenya Red Cross Society is also doing water tracking and drilling more boreholes as part of the long-term plan to mitigate drought in the region, he said.The KRCS has rolled out a cash transfer plan, as a pilot project, that will ensure the affected families in Ganze receive Sh6,000 monthly.
