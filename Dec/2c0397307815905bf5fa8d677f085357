Politicians were barred from addressing mourners on Saturday during the burial of ICT PS Sammy Itemere’s mother Rev Gladys Shihemi in Ikolomani, Kakamega county. Kakamega Senate and woman representative hopefuls Stanley Livondo and Elsie Muhanda, respectively, were not allowed to address the congregation. A church official said the Church of God East Africa, which was presiding over the burial, had issued a decree that politicians will not be allowed to address mourners during their services. “The church has decided that politicians should be given space at funerals a day before the burial,” a pastor said. But some neighbours told the Star that the family blocked politicians from speaking at the funeral after being informed that some politicians planned to attack the Jubilee administration at the funeral. They said the family also feared politicians could clash at the funeral. “You know that Itemere is a government official and allowing Jubilee to be bashed at his home would cast him in bad light,” a neighbour said. Itemere said he does not know why politicians were not allowed to speak. Addressing mourners, he urged residents to work with the government, saying the Luhya are well-represented in government. Politicians have in the past been accused of inciting people and spreading hate speech at funerals. The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops on November 11 said the Church will not allow their pulpits and functions to be used as campaign platforms and forums of hate speech.
