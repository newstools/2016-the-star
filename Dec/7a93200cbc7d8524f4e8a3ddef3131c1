The opposition will hold peaceful street protests on January 4 next year against amendments to election laws which were passed by Parliament on Thursday.Cord leader Raila Odinga declared this at his Capitol Hill office in Nairobi on Thursday saying the Jubilee government has forced them to resort to this action."We have consulted and come to the conclusion that Jubilee is not ready for free and fair elections, ad we cannot take part in fake elections," he said.Raila told a press briefing that the laws were pushed as part of a plot to rig the August 8, 2017 poll.He said the amendments demonstrated Jubilee's "appetite to stay in power, survive on impunity and marginalise poor citizens"."The laws they passed, such as allowing the use of manual identification and transmission of election results in the event of technological failure, is a plan for Jubilee to steal elections but we will not allow it to happen," he said."We cannot go into an election when we know they have plans to steal. DP William Ruto is on record saying Jubilee will win by all mean. He must know Kenya is not his. We will demonstrate until we have a democratic election next year." Raila accused President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration of amending laws to weaken the constitution, ever since taking over in 2013."Jubilee does not want Kenyans to enjoy their constitutional right to vote. They want to manipulate elections by allowing people who are not alive and fake to vote," he said.Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) said Jubilee was frustrating justice but that the "acrimonious passage" of changes to the law will not cause them to give up the fight."ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Kanu secretary general Nick Salat are also with us and want peaceful and credible elections," he said.Read: How electoral agency plans to correct 2013 technology messParliament's special sitting on Thursday turned chaotic after Cord MPs walked out while Jubilee's passed contentious election laws.The legislators were expected to make major changes to the use of technology in the general election, at the session called by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday.Among the laws the MPs passed was a proposal by Majority leader Aden Duale for MCA candidates to have a minimum of a degree by 2022.They also passed a law concerning Election Campaign Financing Act 2013.

This is the spirit the commission wishes to see going forward in addressing the common challenges affecting the electoral process," he stated."IEBC remains committed to the rule of law and urges all actors to play their part in a constructive manner." CAK director general Francis Wangusi said some of the concerns raised will be addressed early next year. They include finding a viable solution to the transmission of results as 1,300 sub-locations lack 3G network connection."We cannot use the 3G network but we have agreed that we will find an alternative because the network covers about 97 per cent of the country and it would be unfair to lock people out of the election process," he said.Members from the government and opposition coalitions attended the meeting called by the National Assembly for clarifications issues raised regarding the new laws.
