A woman with a large growth, who got help after her plight was highlighted by the Star, is now recovering well. Eunice Anyango was admitted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret on September 20. She got help from the Health ministry and Matungu MP aspirant Peter Nabulindo. The 35-year-old comes from Indangalasia sublocation in Matungu subcounty. Anyango held a thanksgiving and prayer ceremony at the Indangalasia YMCA Church on Saturday. She has undergone two surgeries, which have removed 160kg of mass. Anyango awaits a third surgery. She lived with the tumor for more than 20 years because she could not afford the Sh12 million treatment.&ldquo;I slipped and fell in February 1992 but I did not imagine it was serious so I did not go to hospital. The tumour started small but became huge with time. My leg started swelling tremendously and I had to be admitted at Russia Hospital in Kisumu,&rdquo; Anyango said.
