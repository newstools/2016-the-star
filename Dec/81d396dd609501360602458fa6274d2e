Cord has claimed the Jubilee administration is blackmailing the IEBC Selection panel to nominate Lucas Leperes Naikuni as the next electoral commission boss.In a terse statement on Monday, the Coalition said they had reliable information that Jubilee is pushing Leperes whom they alleged is allied to the ruling coalition to take over as the next IEBC chair.&ldquo;We reiterate that we will not allow jubilee to subvert the will of the people of Kenya by influencing recruitment of a Jubilee friendly candidate as the IEBC chair,&rdquo; Cord CEO Norman Magaya said.Warning the government not to dare, Magaya vowed Jubilee will not get away with the alleged attempts to influence the recruitment process.&ldquo;The consequences will be too grave to contemplate,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;It is not lost on us that Jubilee regime has demonstrated insatiable affinity to subversion of processes and perfected the art of short cuts in pursuance of power. We however wish to send a stern warning to Jubilee.&rdquo;Magaya, an advocate of the High Court and a law lecturer, said the debate about the 2017 elections must revolve around credible elections and not peaceful elections.Peace is a direct consequence of credible elections, Magaya said, warning the IEBC selection panel to resist the temptation of what he termed as &ldquo;the carrots dangled by Jubilee&rdquo;.Over the weekend, Deputy President William Ruto faulted the Cord brigade for their sustained onslaught on the IEBC, saying the Opposition cannot be the referee on their own game."They should make a choice whether they want to be staff or managers of IEBC or else leave the commission to carry out its mandate,&rdquo; Ruto said.Read: Duale alleges plot by Raila to use foreigners, technology to rig 2017 pollBut in his statement Magaya said it is obvious why Ruto is against Cord's attempts to seal the loopholes and opportunities to rig the 2017 elections.&ldquo;He [Ruto] knows Jubilee is on a mission to subvert the will of Kenyans. He is acutely aware that jubilee is allergic to a free, fair, accountable and verifiable election. But we send a clear message. The CORD Coalition will not accept another rigged election and those planning to do so must prepare for dire consequences,&rdquo; the Cord CEO said.Two weeks ago, the Star exclusively reported how Cord and Jubilee are seeking to undercut each other by filing petitions to disqualify some applicants for the IEBC jobs.Jubilee for instance is against Mutakha Kangu whom they accuse of having been a think tank of Opposition Chief Raila Odinga.Among the petitions received by the panel is a protest against NCCK secretary general Peter Karanja for failing to declare that Oliver Kisaka Simiyu &ndash;&ndash; one of the candidates for commissioner was his deputy at NCCK.Other petitions were against Ismail Buro Hassan and Ibrahim Wako Boru.Interviews for IEBC chairperson kicked off on Monday.Read: IEBC chair Interviews: I will start with voter register clean up, Taib says
