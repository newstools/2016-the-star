Poor services and the high number of stalled infrastructural projects could be attributed to failure by City Hall to meet its revenue targets in the last three financial years.A report on implementation of the Ward Development Fund released in February showed that 181 infrastructural projects worth Sh1.3 billion in the county&rsquo;s 85 wards have stalled since 2013.According to the 2017-18 County Fiscal Strategy Paper released two weeks ago and published on the county&rsquo;s website, the city collected Sh11.7 billion in the 2015-16 financial year against a target of Sh15.2 billion. This was a shortfall of 23.5 per cent or Sh3.5 billion.In 2014-15, the city missed its local revenue projection by 12.8 per cent. The shortfall stood at 23.1 per cent in the 2013-14 financial year.&ldquo;Internal revenue has been experiencing hurdles over the years, the shortfalls resulting in erratic financing of projects and programmes and sometimes derailing timeliness in implementation,&rdquo; the report reads.The report says the county collected Sh3.1 billion from rates against a target of Sh3.8 billion in 2015-16. This was, however, an increase, compared to the Sh2.6 billion collected in the previous year.At the end of the first quarter of 2016-17, Sh446.5 million had been collected from the stream. Revenue from parking in 2015-16 was Sh2.04 billion compared to a target of Sh2.6 billion. This was an increase compared to 2014-15, when Sh2.02 billion was collected.The county failed to meet its revenue target from building approvals by 29 per cent or Sh177 million during the 2015-16 financial year.Residents and MCAs have expressed concern over poor services, the high number of stalled projects and slow pace of development.At a public forum in October, county officials were taken to task by residents over stalled projects despite budgetary allocation.County Public Works director Frederick Karanja said many contractors failed to complete most of the projects because the Finance department failed to pay them. &ldquo;Most of the contractors doing business with the county have terminated their contracts over nonpayment. They can&rsquo;t stretch more while the county fails to honour their payment deal. In May, the county Budget Committee said several court cases caused it a Sh7 billion shortfall in revenue collection. It said City Hall collected Sh10 billion as at March, against a Sh17 billion target.
