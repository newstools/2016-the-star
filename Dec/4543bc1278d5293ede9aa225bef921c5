WhatsApp has announced it will no longer support a range of older operating platforms by the end of the year.The messaging app said it will be phasing out support for older Windows, Android and Apple models by January, and Blackberry and Nokia by mid-2017.This they claim is because older smartphone platforms can no longer keep up with the latest features being rolled out for the app.The firm wrote on a blog spot: 'As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.'The app, which is now used by more than one billion people worldwide, was launched in the early days of Apple's App Store, when seven out of ten had operating systems offered by Blackberry and Nokia.The full list of platforms being left behind at the end of the year includes: Android 2.1 and Android 2.2; Windows Phone 7 and iPhone 3GS/iOS 6.So if you are using an old phone, you should put in mind that you need to upgrade soonest so as not to be left out of the messaging app.By June 2017, WhatApp will no longer be available for BlackBerry, including BlackBerry 10; Nokia S40; and Nokia Symbian S60.
