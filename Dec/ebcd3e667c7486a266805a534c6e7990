Former anti-corruption PS John Githongo yesterday told the court a former minister implicated in the Anglo Leasing scandal had no reputation to protect.Githongo said in an open court that his basis for saying former minister Chris Murungaru had no reputation is discussions he heard within political circles. While defending himself against a defamation suit filed against him by Murungaru, Githongo said the Anglo Leasing scandal was already in the public domain.&ldquo;I reject claims that Murungaru had a reputation to protect both locally and internationally,&rdquo; said Githongo who took to the witness dock to defend himself.He quoted an article by the Standard newspaper on October 10, 2005, about the scandal to which the former minister was allegedly linked. Githongo also said as PS he was required to look into past corruption crimes, among many things, and delink the [President Mwai] Kibaki government from it, given that it came to power on an anti-corruption ticket.
