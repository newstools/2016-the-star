St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Mumias has registered 100 per cent admissions since the public hospital medics went on strike on Monday.Administrator Michael Mugo said the maternity wing is congested. &ldquo;The number of mothers seeking delivery services has gone up three times. This has overwhelmed our bed capacity,&rdquo; he said.Mugo said the 220-bed hospital is crowded and management is looking to buy more beds. &ldquo;I have communicated to Kakamega county director of health Dr David Oluoch to supplement us with more drugs and other supplies so that we can manage the swelling number of patients,&rdquo; he said.Mugo said the hospital has invited doctors from neighbouring private hospitals to help out. &ldquo;We are serving over 300 patients in the outpatient department. The number in our wards has also gone up almost 100 per cent. Our four resident doctors cannot cope with the overwhelming demand. We had to seek assistance,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have three doctors from Kapenguria, one from Kiambu and one from Busia who have come to assist. Those who had gone for studies were recalled and we have sufficient personnel to handle the increased admission.&rdquo;Addressing journalists in his office on Wednesday, Mugo said doctors and nurses who had gone on leave had been recalled. He said their greatest challenge is the lack of incubators in the maternity wing&ldquo;We have four incubators but the number of newborns [who require to] remain in the incubators has gone up. We do not know how to handle such cases,&rdquo; he said. Mugo said the facility is likely to experience a crisis due to the increased number of patients. &ldquo;If the strike is not called off soon, we may end up rejecting some patients because our facility will not be able to handle the influx of patients who are coming for treatment,&rdquo; he said.
