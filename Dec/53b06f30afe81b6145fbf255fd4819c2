Embakasi Garrison Secondary School has been expanded to accommodate more students. Speaking on a tour of the school, Embakasi East MP John Omondi said through CDF, the school will see three more streams added from Form One to Form Four. They will be operational starting January. The management says the school will have a new administration block, new toilets and bathrooms, library and a Chemistry, Physics, Biology and computer laboratory. Omondi said parents from the constituency and neighbouring constituencies like Embakasi South, which has no secondary school, should enrol their children in the school. He asked the parents to apply for CDF bursaries so the most deserving children can be identified and supported. However, the MP did not reveal how much CDF cash was allocated towards expansion of the school. Garrison project manager Major Kuria and head teacher Veronica Muli thanked the MP and the CDF team for the support. MuIi said the expansion will help hundreds of students access quality education.
