A nuts company CEO has said he is confident he will win in the Murang'a governor election when he runs a second time next year.Equatorial Nuts Processing Company CEO Moses Mwangi said he is the most suitable candidate and presents a perfect balance between incumbent Mwangi Wairia and his main rival Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau.Common Wealth technocrat Julius Kaberere, who was in the contest in 2013, is said to be warming up for election, but he is yet to make a public declaration.Mwangi contested for governor on March 4, 2013, but lost to Wairia after garnering 43,103 votes against Wairia&rsquo;s 335,280.He ran on a Mzalendo Saba Saba ticket after losing TNA&rsquo;s nomination to Wairia.Mwangi said he will resign from his job in January to start his campaigns.&ldquo;I'm ready to fight for the seat full throttle and I'm hoping for a triumph,&rdquo; he told the Star yesterday.Mwangi said he will deliver better services to Murang&rsquo;a residents and unite those divided by the warring Wairia and Kamau factions.&ldquo;I am ready to conduct peaceful campaigns and am so saddened when I see political leaders inciting [people to] violence in the county yet it is not their children fighting,&rdquo; he said.
