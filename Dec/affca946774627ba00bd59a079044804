Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok has warned against plans to amend the Petroleum Bill 2015.He said this is a plan to deny local communities the 10 per cent resource benefit, which had earlier been proposed. In a statement on Wednesday, Nanok said Turkana residents are concerned that President Uhuru Kenyatta returned the Petroleum Bill to Parliament and recommended drastic changes to the benefits sharing formula.The governor said the reduction from 10 to 5 per cent of benefits from oil proceeds will deny the host community and residents of Turkana their rightful share. The President s amendment to the Bill to reduce the benefits sharing percentage for host community from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and to replace the share for the county government from 20 per cent with a formula that caters for equitable share for taxes is an outright violation of the Constitution, Nanok said. He said the move to slash community benefits amounts to legalising inequality and theft of resources from the people.
