The government, working with the World Bank, will expand irrigation schemes and rehabilitate dykes in Busia county to the tune of Sh10 billion.Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa said the project will go a long way in ensuring that the community has enough food, therefore curb poverty.The CS disclosed the plan on Friday during the official launch of the expansion of Sisenya irrigation scheme in Budalang'i.The scheme will be expanded from the current 200 acres to 500 acres and is set to take up flood waters that normally disrupt livelihoods in the area."The national government wants to put a total of 20,000 acres under irrigation across the country. We want Busia to produce a variety of crops by being part of these projects," the CS said.Wamalwa thanked the Rural Electrification Authority for providing a transformer which he said will make it easier to pump the water that will be used for irrigation at the scheme.He said that the transformer will also give the local community an opportunity to have their homes supplied with electricity.Former Budalangi MP Raphael Wanjala said the irrigation project will be the lifeline of the area residents."The residents of Sisenye had been relying of fish as a source of livelihood, but today Lake Victoria has no fish leaving agriculture as the only way out," said Wanjala.The event was attended by National Irrigation Board director Beatrice Mbingi, Water PS Nduati Mwangi, REA officials and local leaders.Read: Uhuru targets Kisii, Kamba with goodies
