The more than 100 striking consultants who withdrew from the Kenyatta National Hospital on Wednesday are now working in the hospital&rsquo;s private wing.A manager at the hospital confirmed many of the doctors who &ldquo;withdrew their services&rdquo; from the public wards now work full-time in the more expensive private wing.&ldquo;The consultants are employees of KNH so they had not joined the strike. But they are now on strike in the public wards but serving patients whom they have admitted privately,&rdquo; the manager said.Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists&rsquo; Union secretary general Ouma Oluga said the consultants have withdrawn from the public wing because they were overwhelmed, as patients were too many, and they are too few.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re forced to operate like a level four hospital for lack of personnel we work hand in hand with,&rdquo; he said.Last week&rsquo;s calls by the union for doctors in private and mission hospitals to stop work appear to have borne no fruit.A spot check at the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Mater Hospital and St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital showed their services have not stopped.Only public hospital doctors are currently on strike, after nurses and clinical officers ended their strike on Wednesday. Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu yesterday said doctors must &ldquo;humble&rdquo; themselves and return to negotiations.&ldquo;The issues we have won&rsquo;t be addressed in the manner they are trying to. They should humble themselves and come to the negotiating table,&rdquo; Mailu said.The doctors abandoned talks with the Health ministry after judge Hellen Wasilwa ruled last week that their strike is illegal.&ldquo;We want to hear them and explore every possibility to ensure they serve Kenyans,&rdquo; Mailu said.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya accused doctors of arrogance, saying they walked out of talks with the CoG.&ldquo;We urge doctors to stop the grandstanding and intransigence with which they are handling this manner,&rdquo; he said.
