National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi has directsed MPs to investigate the ban on GMO products and report within 90 days. Muturi was acting on a petition filed by Joel Ochieng on behalf of the Kenya University Biotechnology Consortium. Kenya imposed a ban on imports of GM foods in 2012 following the publication of the Gilles-Eric Seralini study that linked consumption of the Monsanto&rsquo;s GM maize to cancer in laboratory rats. In June, the National Biosafety Authority allowed researchers to conduct field trials for GM maize subject to approval by the National Environmental Management Authority. The petitioners are asking for lifting of the ban on consumption of food derived from genetically modified organisms and issuance of permit to conduct field trials for GM maize. The petitioner further added that todate, the ban on GMO foods has not been gazetted.
