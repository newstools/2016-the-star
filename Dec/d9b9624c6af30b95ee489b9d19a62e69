The National Police Service Commission has fired 127 Traffic police officers who failed the vetting process.Chairperson Johnston Kavuludi yesterday said the majority of the officers were those involved in the matatu business. He said the 127 were among 904 Traffic police officers vetted in May. They are from Coast, Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley.&ldquo;Out of the 127, 36 are from Coast, 23 from Western, 50 from Rift Valley and 18 from Nyanza,&rdquo; Kavuludi said.He said there are pending investigations of 72 officers, adding 26 were removed after they opted not to be vetted. Kavuludi said six officers out of the 20 officers who had previously been sacked but asked for a review of their results had been reinstated.They include former AP spokesperson Masoud Mwinyi, William Metto, Japheth Ngatwa, Daniel Chacha, William Kariuki and Festus Luruma.&ldquo;Twelve officers failed the vetting review, while one applied to retire. One is awaiting conclusion of a court case, which she filed against the Commission,&rdquo; Kavuludi said. &ldquo;Unexplained financial transactions, sending and receiving money from fellow police officers in the Traffic department and operating matatu business are among the reasons that informed their removal.&rdquo;He said some received money from transporters and breakdown business operators, while others had professional misconduct. Kavuludi said the fact that 127 out of 904 officers vetted have been removed attests to the endemic corruption in the Traffic department.
