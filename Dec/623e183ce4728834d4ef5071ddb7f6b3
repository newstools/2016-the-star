The English and Kiswahili languages were the most poorly done subjects in the 2016 KCSE exam, compared to 2015.In 2015, alternative mathematics B, history and government and CRE were the most poorly done subjects.Art and design, woodwork and drawing as well as design recorded the most significant improvement, compared to the 2015 exam.Computer studies and Kenya Sign Language also registered significant improvement.The improvement in computer studies is significant to the Jubilee government, coming at a time it is rolling out the Digital Literacy Programme.The government is also increasing electricity connection to schools across the country, especially in rural areas.Mathematics alternative B and biology for the blind registered no significant improvement in the results released by Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i on Thursday at Shimo la Tewa Secondary School in Mombasa.Matiang&rsquo;i said the strict measures implemented by his ministry helped curb cheating.This could be the reason for a decline in performance in the main subjects, including English, Kiswahili, mathematics alternative A, biology, physics, chemistry, general sciences, history and government, geography and CRE.The number of straight As in the whole country significantly declined from as high as 2,685 in 2015 to only 141. Matiang&rsquo;i said previously, some schools would produce more than 200 As, but they could not manage 10.&ldquo;Some students have confessed to not being able to cope through a year of university after posting mean grades of A plain in the previous years,&rdquo; he said.The new measures the CS introduced saw the exam markers complete their work in record time. The results are traditionally released towards the end of February. Knec chairman George Magoha said, &ldquo;Some subjects were marked in under one month. This is efficiency.&rdquo;He said the exam&rsquo;s integrity has significantly improved as education stakeholders look for ways of improving it further.
