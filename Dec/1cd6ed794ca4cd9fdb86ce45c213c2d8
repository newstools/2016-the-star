Riverside pipped arch-rivals Obino FC in a repeat of last year&rsquo;s final to retain the Omogi Cup and walk away with lucrative cash prizes and the bragging rights for the second year running.An own goal by Obino defender Michael Ongengo in the 59th minute gifted the victors during the match played at Kadiju grounds. Ongengo directed the ball into the net after failing to clear a dangerous ball from Riverside&rsquo;s Elly Otieno. Betting company, SportPesa donated playing kit and ball to all the participating teams.Riverside rarely missed their top scorer Laban Odhiambo, who limped off just after the breather, as they created a glut of chances and could have won the contest with a bigger margin had they converted their chances, with Collins Odhiambo and Bernard Obuon being the main culprits. The final, however, had to be stopped for about 20 minutes after Obino&rsquo;s custodian William Olum suffered a suspected fractured rib following a collusion with Riverside&rsquo;s striker Collins Odhiambo and had to be rushed to the hospital. Riverside coach Kennedy Odongo was happy with the victory, but lauded Obino for giving them a run for their money, noting that it was their toughest match of the season.On their way to the final, Riverside beat Orongo 5-4 on post-match penalties after 1-1 draw in regular time in the quarter-finals, then stunned County League side Masawa 3-0 in the semis, while Obino beat Alara 2-1 in the quarter-final and Kadiju 1-0 in the semis, to reach the finals. John Oruko won the tournament&rsquo;s golden boot award with 11 goals and went home with a trophy donated by former Gor Mahia striker Gor Oronge and cash prize. In the third play-offs, Kadiju pipped Masawa 1-0 in an early kick-off at the same venue. The tournament attracted 16 teams.
