More than 200 youths took to the streets on Saturday saying Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali had not given them the Sh3,000 each he promised them.The group from Eshianda constituency said Washiali was to give them the money for giving DP William Ruto a warm welcome to a harambee in the region on Friday. We were promised that if mheshimiwa Ruto came and we offered him a warm welcome, we would be given the money. Now that he has come we have been given Sh200 only, said Evans Misao.Misao said that had lost trust in Washiali as he always fails to keep his promises.They said they stayed at the rally until evening hoping they would get their money but that this was not the case. They go elsewhere for development but only hold harambees in Mumias. Is Mumias the same as other places or is it different? asked another youth."We will unite to make sure the Jubilee government goes goes."Ruto presided over three fundraisers in Kakamega c.ounty.The tight schedule has been seen as a rush to beat the Wednesday deadline for politicians not to participate in such events.The DP started at Khayega primary school in Shinyalu constituency where he donated Sh1 million before moving to Ikonyero in Lurambi where he donated another Sh1 million, and a similar amount for President Uhuru Kenyatta.He promised to wire another Sh3m to the school for construction of a tuition block.Ruto also witnessed electricity connection in Shinyalu, Lurambi constituencies and told residents that the government had scrapped examination fees, increased capitation and reviewed the curriculum for the sake of the country's development."We can transform our country and secure the future for our children if we resolve that the nation comes before self," he said.More on this: DP Ruto rushed to Kakamega to beat fundraising deadline
