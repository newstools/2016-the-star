Jubilee Party has dismissed reports of chaos during ongoing primaries but warned of tough disciplinary measures if anyone is found guilty.Secretariat chairperson Raphael Tuju said they have only experienced disagreements."You should watch the ODM primaries to understand what (chaos) means before saying JP primaries were chaotic," he said on Friday.Tuju noted that the ruling coalition has enjoyed enormous democratic space for people to debate, agree and disagree on important issues."Out of the 40 counties, our members disagreed in only four. We postponed the elections in Bungoma since President Uhuru Kenyatta was travelling there. We will hold them at the right moment," the chairman said.He added that the six remaining counties will complete their nominations today.Read: Jubilee meeting in Voi turns chaotic as members reject 'handpicked' delegates.JP secretary general Veronica Maina said at the party headquarters that fair nominations will help unite and move the country forward."We should not spread propaganda after people lose nominations," she said.But chaos have been reported during Jubilee elections in areas including Laikipia and Kericho.One person was injured during the exercise in Laikipia West, after aspirants demanded their area receive more seats because of the large number of voters.In Kericho, elections nearly aborted after some aspirants and their supporters attempted to rough up Kipkelion East MP Joseph Limo.Hecklers disrupted the process several times, accusing Limo of trying to help his cronies to land nominations, but heavily armed police officers intervened.Read: Chaos mars Jubilee election in LaikipiaAlso read: Kericho Jubilee politicians say election a 'mockery of democracy'
