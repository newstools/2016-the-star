Uber drivers are in a protracted court battle with their employer Uber Kenya Limited and Uber International BV over the cost of ferrying clients to various destinations.Kanuri Limited and 34 others want the court to restrain Uber firms from implementing a 35 per cent fare reduction or the minimum Sh200 charged by their vehicles.Yesterday, after Uber and the aggrieved drivers argued the case, Justice Francis Tuiyot urged both parties to first negotiate and try to arrive at an agreement before the matter is resolved by the court.He gave the parties up to February 8, then they go back to court to confirm if they would have hammered out a deal.The drivers, through lawyer Ekuru Aukot, said their businesses have been grounded due to what they consider unfair reduction of fares by Uber compared to the normal market rates charged by their competitors.Uber Kenya, however, is opposed to the suit and wants the court to remove it as a respondent, saying the drivers cannot bring a claim against it.&ldquo;The plaintiffs have no common interest that could entitle them to file a suit against the defendants. Their documents do not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the defendants,&rdquo; Uber said.Tuiyot heard that the orders being sought intend to vary the terms of the agreement entered between the drivers and the firms, and cannot be granted at this time.The drivers now want the court to compel the firms to restore the fares to the originally charged Sh60 per kilometre and a minimum fare of Sh300.They also want the court to restrain the firms from varying fares without consulting them and having an express agreement.
