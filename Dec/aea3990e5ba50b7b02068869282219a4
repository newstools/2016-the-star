In a political process, there is need for order and organisation and this only comes with structures that are clear and beyond political arrangements administrative structures.That is why there is need for a team that handles each the political and the administrative separately, especially in the lead-up to a general election.We need to embark on recruitment of members beyond those who are already part of Jubilee, who are now more than six million, including the affiliate parties.We therefore need to first and foremost give all of these members new registration in Jubilee, we also need to handle agents of the party and organisers of campaign activities.We need to start giving information to aspirants so that people can know that, when they need certain information, it is available.We have to have people manning the offices at the counties.In the model of inclusivity, by bringing aspirants and elected leaders together, we get the best of those who can hold the fort on an interim basis.Inasmuch as they are all competing, they all know that there is this one person in the county they can trust.This is how you get more neutral parties as opposed to where you have had hard-fought elections that produced a winner and a loser.So that winner is the one running the party and everyone else feels the winner has a certain political line, but it is arrived at by consensus and then there is inclusivity and everyone has trust and faith in that office.In politics, when a decision is made and you are not involved and your name is not there, you could become paranoid and think someone has a plan against you.The aim of setting up these teams is not to defuse the tensions but it will help make all feel included in decision-making, which is important for them to feel there is a part they have played.It also helps them to know that they are owners and that there is no early Jubilee owner or later Jubilee owner.The National Presidential Campaign Team remains and now the counties can also form their own county-based campaign teams.We are focusing on strengthening the youth and women&rsquo;s movements in the party, as well as harmonising the existing structures with the polling stations.Sakaja is a nominated MP and a Jubilee aspirant for Nairobi Governor
