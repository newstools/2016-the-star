Mwingi North MP John Munuve has accused fellow Wiper rebels in Kitui county of being selfish and using the Jubilee Party elections for the wrong cause.He said Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central) and Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South) are using the JP polls to prepare grounds for their re-election and peddling influence, instead of looking for strong leadership that can deliver the maximum number of votes for JP.During a press conference in Mwingi, Munuve said no one from his constituency was involved in Wednesday&rsquo;s Jubilee Party elections in Kitui.Setback to Jubilee PartyHe warned that such a move risks watering down the gains that President Uhuru Kenyatta made during his recent visit to Ukambani.Munuve urged JP headquarters to change the way the party affairs are run in Kitui and ensure inclusivity in electoral processes.During the Jubilee Party elections on Wednesday, there was a lot of mayhem with police barring some delegates from the poll venue in Kitui town.A stealthy last-minute change of the venue for the election of Kitui Jubilee Party interim officials caused discontent and confusion as some party delegates were locked out.Party delegates had thronged a hotel where the polls were initially scheduled to take place as early as 6am only to learn of a switch to a different hotel in Kitui town. When they arrived at the new venue, the gates were locked.Barred from votingThe stranded Jubilee adherents, who claimed to be registered party members, remained outside as the elections were conducted inside the hotel. Not even a bitter altercation with the police manning the gate would buy them a ticket in.Among those locked out of the elections were ardent Jubilee supporter Peter Mwanza from Mwingi Central and Schola Kamene from Kitui West. Kamene had lately openly passed herself off as the coordinator of JP activities in Kitui county.&ldquo;We cannot wake up early in solidarity with party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta only to be frustrated by a few people furthering selfish interest,&rdquo; Mwanza said.It is unfair to deny Jubilee members their democratic right to elect county officials.&ldquo;This cannot be considered a Jubilee Party affair but an exercise to serve the whims of individuals,&rdquo; Mwanza said. He showed the media his party membership card to justify that he should have been allowed to participate in the polls.Mwanza said for Jubilee to make inroads in Kitui, the campaign activities should not be left to the whims of a few self-centred individuals.The group accused Mutambu and Nyamai of locking them out to allow them plant their cronies as Jubilee officials.Only members were allowed inHowever, Mutambu said the polls were free and fair.But Mutambu and Nyamai later told the media that only members who could prove their Jubilee membership were allowed into the poll venue. They said party affairs could not be carried out in a public baraza where everyone is allowed to participateNyamai said all constituencies in Kitui were involved in the elections.&ldquo;I have no personal interests in this process and I don&rsquo;t understand why Munuve is complaining because he has been involved in all the discussions,&rdquo; she said.Nyamai cautioned Jubilee supporters to be wary of individuals masquerading as party officials.During the elections, former KBC managing director Caxton Munyoki was elected Kitui county interim chairman.Other officials include Josephat Mulyungi (treasurer), Caxton Mbiti (secretary) and Fred Makanda (organising secretary).
