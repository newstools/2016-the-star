Medical specialists offering services in private hospitals have given the government a two days ultimatum to fulfill the 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement.The doctors are demanding a 300 per cent salary increase, which will give an undergraduate intern a monthly salary of Sh325,000, rising to Sh400,000 when he or she graduates.Addressing journalists at Kenyatta National Hospital, the medics led by Professor Emily Rogena, a pathologist at Kenyatta National Hospital private wing, said that the government had shown reluctance in the previous negotiations, something that has led to loss of lives.&ldquo;We have come to this decision in show of solidarity to our colleagues in the public sector that we also serve and know the challenges that are affecting them,&rdquo; Rogena said.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board warned striking doctors not to disrupt services at private and mission hospitals terming the move as illigal. &ldquo;The board notes that the call for the stoppage of services in private health institutions not only interferes with the management and operations of private entities, but also interferes with the constitutional rights of the public to access healthcare services as espoused under Article 43 ( 1 ) (a) and also the right to access emergency medical services as stipulated in Article 43( 2 ),&rdquo; Board chairman George Magoha said.Read: Don&rsquo;t disrupt private facilities, strikers toldThe specialist serve in several hospitals among them: MP Shah, Nairobi Hospital, Mater Hospital and the Aga Khan Hospital.Read: Health crisis deepens as private hospitals prepare to join doctors' strikeKenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDU) Secretary General Ouma Oluga, further re-affirmed that Kenyatta private wing will also remain closed.&ldquo;Reports of the Kenyatta hospital private wing being in operations have been talked about but I want to tell you that we have discussed with the doctors and it will completely be out of operation,&rdquo; Oluga said.Oluga also raised concern over double standards shown by the judiciary in handling of the doctors issues.&ldquo;We wonder why the judiciary is terming our strike illegal even after we had battled in court and they gave the government a one month ultimatum to implement the 2013 CBA, this is questionable.&rdquo; Oluga added.Read: Labour court declares doctors strike illegalThe health workers have threatened to withdraw from any kind of negotiations if the government takes legal action on the union leaders.The Union leaders had earlier been issued with a notice to appear before the industrial court on Monday and explain why legal action should not be taken against them for violating the court decision.
