Tomorrow s Kikao046 is an opportunity to engage the youth, not to settle scores, politicians have been told.There are fears the rivalry between Governor John Nyagarama and his main rival for the job, West Mugirango MP James Gesami, may overshadow the forum.ODM leader Raila Odinga will attend the event at Nyamira Primary School grounds. Kikao is a forum to engage the young people in finding solutions to their problems through mentorship and training. This is purely a youth forum, where they will engage with Raila and the county leadership on issues affecting them and the country at large, and get answers. It should not be a popularity contest, Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire said.The legislator downplayed the fears or disorder, saying all Cord leaders in Nyamira agreed their rivalry will not play out at the convention. ODM is a leadership that accommodates the youth and we want the youth to play a key role in defining the destiny of this country, especially in the 2017 elections, Bosire told the Star in a phone interview.Seek elective postsThe MP urged the youth to run for election. That is the only way they will define their future and change the leadership of this country, the ODM treasurer said.Kikao046 will be the fifth edition of the youth consultative forum.The forum has also been held Mombasa, Kakamega, Kisii, and Kilifi.Raila is expected to use the opportunity to drum up support for his presidential bid.
