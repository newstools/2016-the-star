After surrendering the 2016 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men&rsquo;s Premier League title to Strathmore University, Butali Sugar Warriors have switched focus to the next year&rsquo;s Africa Club Championship set for January 7-15 in NairobiThe warriors, who dethroned former champions Kenya Police in 2014 before retaining the trophy in 2015 were, however, outdone 3-0 by the students on a penalty shoot-out, having played to a 1-all draw in regular time on Sunday at the City Park Stadium. The Warriors, who were drawn in Pool &lsquo;A&rsquo; in the regular season, kept unbeaten record and went ahead to defeat Green Sharks 2-1 in the semis last weekend to set up final date with the student.The warriors head coach Cliffe Okello said it&rsquo;s disheartening that they didn&rsquo;t retain the trophy for the third time in a row, but remained optimistic the Africa Club Championship will give the Western side a chance to make amends. &ldquo;This is a wake up call for us. When you win a couple of times, you sometimes tend to rest on your laurels and forget how it feels to lose. But now that we lost, we have to go back to the drawing board and come back stronger during the continental show and during 2017 league ,&rdquo; noted the former national team player. Last year, the warriors, Kenya Police and Strathmore University missed the Africa show that was held in Lusaka, Zambia. Meanwhile, KHU officials and team managers will hold a meeting later this month to decide on the format of the 2017 league. KHU vice chairperson Elina Shiveka said: &ldquo; We can&rsquo;t decide for teams the format for 2017 and that&rsquo;s why we are calling for a meeting.&rdquo;
