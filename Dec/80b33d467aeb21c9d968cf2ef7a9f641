Deputy President William Ruto yesterday hosted delegations from Baringo and Nakuru counties as his supremacy battle with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi intensified in the Rift Valley.Sources said he hosted the delegations in his Sugoi home as part of a series of meetings he will host with other groups from the Rift Valley and Western this week.All elected politicians, MCAs and other grassroot leaders from Baringo were in the delegation at the close door meeting where sources said politics was top on the agenda with the DP asking those in the group why some of them were following Gideon yet he had nothing important to offer them.&ldquo;I'm working hard to ensure that you have many projects in Baringo, including a university, yet some of you are busy following someone who has nothing to offer, except joining those who are used to organising street demonstrations,&rdquo; Ruto said.Governor Benjamin Cheboi led the delegation from Baringo.The source said the leaders had resolved to back DP Ruto and the Jubilee Party, while working to ensure that Kanu and Gideon are neutralised ahead of the 2017 election.&ldquo;We made it clear that we are behind Ruto and the high-talk by Kanu leaders will not have effect in Baringo,&rdquo; an MP, who was part of the delegation that comprised more than 1,000 Jubilee supporters, said.Ruto told the delegation he is committed to ensure unity of the Rift Valley.Moi has in the last one month sustained hard-hitting criticism from the DP, whom he has accused of focusing on his 2022 presidential ambitions at the expense of the Kalenjin community unity.Three weeks ago, Moi also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to directly seek votes from the Kalenjin community, instead of relying on the DP.&ldquo;He should come instead of going through anyone else,&rdquo; the Baringo Senator said. Moi has lately teamed up with Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto in opposing Jubilee&rsquo;s dominance in the region.Yesterday, sources said Jubilee would field strong aspirants in the region where Kanu appears to have gained ground in the last few month.The DP has made frequent visits to the region this year to the Rift Valley.Five hopefuls have joined in the race for the Baringo Senate seat.Most of them are seeking the Jubilee Party ticket to fight it out with Senator Moi.Rift Valley Water Services Board director Christine Ndoigo is the latest entrant to declare her interest.Others in the race are Baringo Livestock chief officer Gideon Toromo, Samuel Cheraisi, Kaptuiya Cheboiwo and Ayabei Kennedy.Sources said the DP also dwelt on the issue of Jubilee nominations assuring aspirants they would be free and fair.Today, the DP will host other delegations from Rift Valley to be followed by groups from Western tomorrow.
