Governors have decried the collapse of Integrated Management Information System (IFMIS) for the past two days saying counties cannot process payments and salaries.In a statement on Wednesday, Council of Governors Chairman Peter Munya said services at the counties could come to a complete halt if there is no quick solution to the problem."The Integrated Financial management Information System, (IFMIS) which has been marred with various challenges including mishandling of passwords and misappropriation of public funds, has not been functioning for the last two days," he said.The Meru governor called for immediate action to ensure county governors are not blamed for the collapse of services at the counties."What we do not understand is whether the system breakdown is by design or by default. Something sinister could be going on, then county leaders would be blamed for any inconsistencies that would arise. We demand that appropriate actions be taken to restore the system," he said.He said some of the key services which are not being offered include processing of salaries for the county staff across the country."Furthermore, payments to the vendors and suppliers of various services to the counties also can&rsquo;t be done as required, taking in mind that we are headed to the festive season and the staff as well as the suppliers need to be paid in time. Failure to which services at the counties could come to a complete halt," Munya stated.In September Governors accused the national government of denying them access to funds for county projects in a bid to undermine their leadership and ensure they are rejected in next year&rsquo;s elections.Read: Taxman seeks direct access to IFMIS for dues : Is Kenya INC Broke, Or Is It Just Broken?
