The 17-storey Mega Plaza in Kisumu, the town s tallest building, is not on the verge of collapse, the National Construction Authority has said. Tenants had panicked following reports its columns have cracked. The building is on Oginga Odinga Street. The National Building Inspectorate and Housing ministry officials inspected the building. NBI secretary Moses Nyakiongora said there is no cause for alarm and the public is safe. He sits on the NCA board. Nyakiongora said they have checked the drawings and architectural design. He said the concerns were a result of ongoing reinforcement of some of the building s pillars. Nyakiongora said engineers are reinforcing six columns on the ground and first floor because of an additional load a water tank that will be placed on the rooftop. The tank has a capacity of 620,000 litres, he said. Nyakiongora said, however, further inspections will be carried out before the building is cleared.
