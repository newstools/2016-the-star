The United Nations Development Programme has said it will maintain impartiality in next year&rsquo;s polls, even as it pumps billions of shillings in electoral support. In a statement yesterday, the UN agency said it continues to carry its electoral assistance programme in an objective, impartial, neutral and independent manner.The UNDP&rsquo;s reassurance came amid government crackdown on donors. A US-based institution, IFES, has been banned and its accounts frozen. &ldquo;UN electoral assistance is provided only on the basis of a specific request from the national authorities, which, for Kenya, was received in 2014,&rdquo; UNDP said.It said its assistance to the IEBC and the office of the registrar of political parties was approved and signed by Treasury on July 7 last year.It was the product of extensive consultation with various stakeholders, UNDP said. The agency said the &lsquo;Strengthening Electoral Processes in Kenya&rsquo; programme has received resources for the current phase from the USA, United Kingdom and the European Union.
