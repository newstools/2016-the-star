More than 50 Muslim clerics in Wajir county have received a camel each from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Governor Ahmed Abdullahi said the donation will go a long way in improving the economic well-being of sheikhs and Imams, who mostly volunteer their services.&ldquo;The donation is not enough to reach every sheikh and imam in Wajir town, but we have decided to distribute the camels evenly to ensure every corner of this town gets them,&rdquo; he said on Saturday.Abdullahi thanked the agency and the Turkish government for supporting clerics. &ldquo;We had submitted several proposals to the agency. They asked us what was treasured locally so that they could donate to the clerics. We then identified camels, whose ownership is revered among the Wajir communities,&rdquo; he said.Abdullahi said he has been in the forefront providing farm inputs and equipment to the Northeastern counties.He said he has also donated animals for sacrifice during Eid festivals. Abdullahi urged the national government to closely work with the clerics to improve security.He said the clerics interact with many people so they are better placed to help security agencies identify criminals.During the handing over of the camels in Wajir town, the governor urged the religious leaders to lead the faithful in praying for rain.The county faces severe drought.
