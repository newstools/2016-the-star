Patients in Nakuru level five hospitals remained unattended to yesterday as doctors and nurses continued with their strike.A spot check by the Star showed most of the patients were turned away, with only subordinate staff at the hospitals doing routine cleaning.Majority of the patients were being transferred to private hospitals by their families.The county government has advertised vacancies for nurses in all the public hospitals.Health chief officer Samuel Mwaura said the new nurses will work for seven months on contract.But the nurses&rsquo; association chairperson Cyprian Odera said the county is trying to threaten the nurses by advertising their positions.Speaking to the Star on the phone, she said they will not resume work until their demands, including promotions, are met.&ldquo;The Nakuru government is trying to use the old trick of threatening nurses to go back to work, but that is not going to happen until they honour our agreement,&rdquo; she said.Odera said last year, the county agreed to promote 700 nurses in phases but that has not happened, one year down the line.She said they have been trying to follow up with the county government but there has not been clear communication.Odera said the county claims it has promoted 200 nurses, but does not give more details.&ldquo;In our return-to-work formula in September last year, the county government agreed to promote 700 nurses in phases but so far nothing has happened, they claim to have promoted 200 but they are not willing to tell us which criteria they used,&rdquo; she said.Odera urged all the nurses not to resume work until their demands are fully addressed.
