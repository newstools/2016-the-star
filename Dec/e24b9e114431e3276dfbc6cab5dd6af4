Logistics and transportation firm Siginon has called on authorities to fast track plans to build a second runway at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as plans for direct flights to the US gathers steam. "This year has been good and with the (proposed) direct flights to the US,they should fast track the second runway given that Nairobi is a capital city and given the number of cargo and passengers that we are moving,&rdquo; managing director Meshack Kipturgo said yesterday in Nairobi. &ldquo;We really need a second runway because if there's a problem with the first runway business can still go on as usual."
