Tana River Deputy Governor Jire Siyat yesterday tore into Governor Hussein Dado, accusing him of being on a "looting spree".Speaking in Chardende yesterday, Jire cited the auditor's report which stated Sh725 million cannot be accounted for.He said, "If the governor does not explain where the money is, he should forget about defending his seat.&rdquo;The audit report states Sh34 million was used to buy Dado a bullet-proof vehicle."Why is the governor buying a bullet-proof vehicle? We are busy preaching peace but could there be something he is aware of that will take place during next year's campaign that he is not telling us?" Jire said.He also questioned the Sh30 million paid to a contractor to build a footbridge at Danisa Onkolde which is yet to be constructed three months later.
