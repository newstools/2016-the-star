Defending men&rsquo;s volleyball champions Kenya powered their way into the final of the East Africa Inter Parliamentary games after seeing off stubborn East African Legislative Assemble 2-0 at the KPA Makande Gymnasium yesterday.The Kenyans, who are determined to retain the title they won last year in Rwanda, started strongly leading their opponents 12-5 lead in the early stages of the game but a change of tactics by EALA saw them claw their way back into the games twice forcing a 16-16 and 18-18 ties with Alexander Lyambabake in charge before Kenya went ahead to win the first set 25-22.The Kenyans, who over-relied on Hon Arthur Odera, Isaac Melly, John Waiganjo and Benson Mutura among others came to the second set much stronger making mince meat of their opponents with an easy 25-15 demolition with Cosmas Kirui as the destroyer in chief.Kenya will now meet Rwanda in today&rsquo;s men volleyball final after Rwanda saw off Uganda 2-0 ( 25-19, 25-12) in the other semi-final at the same venue.The Kenyan Parliament football team was not as lucky when they were bundled out at the group stages on inferior goal difference after beating Tanzania 1-0 in their last group match.Jimmy Okwiri and Stephen Ngata missed penalties as all the three countries Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania rounded off the group stages on three points each.Uganda, who had beaten Kenya buy a solitary goal, lost 1-2 to neighbours Tanzania in an earlier match at KPA Mbaraki sports ground. Uganda should have themselves to blame for missing penalty in the second half which could have enabled them share the spoils with the opponents.After a deadlocked first half, Rufiji MP Hon. Mohamed Omar Mchengerwa sent Tanzania up in the 35th minute before increasing the lead in the 53rd minute from a rebound. Uganda were awarded a penalty in the 56th minute after Hon. Otto Odonga was pulled down inside the box but Hon. Robert Sekitoleko&rsquo;s spot kick went over the bar.Uganda were awarded another penalty in the 68th minute following another infringement inside the box and Kampala Central MP Hon. Mohammed Nsereko scored.Meanwhile Rwanda failed to show up for their Group &lsquo;B&rsquo; tie against Burundi.The late withdrawal of Rwanda from the games, leaves Group &lsquo;B&rsquo; with only East African Legislative Assembly (and Burundi who have both qualified for the semi finals.
