Lake Naivasha is in danger of drying up because upcoming capital projects require so much water they could overwhelm it, experts have warned. The lake is the only source of water for Naivasha town.Imarisha Naivasha Board CEO Kamau Mbogo said the Industrial Park and standard gauge railway will attract 280 large businesses. He said water supply to the park alone will increase from 30,000 to 70,000 cubic metres a day.&ldquo;Where will the water come from? All the boreholes on the eastern side, where the projects are being carried out, are full of fluoride and we wonder whether the lake will fully support the demand,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Over the years, we have witnessed the scramble for Naivasha, with large-scale commercial investments that include development of holiday homes and resorts, but we do not factor in the impact the projects will have on the environment.&rdquo;Mbogo said the major casualties of the developments will be the lake&rsquo;s ecosystem and all the investments it supports, significantly fisheries, tourism and floriculture.Speaking in Naivasha, he said the proposal to build three dams in the Aberdares catchment areas would have a negative impact on the lake.&ldquo;All the rivers in the upper catchment area that feed the lake will be diverted to the dams and this means the beginning of the end of the lake,&rdquo; Mbogo said.He called for critical assessment of proposals for the projects and proper planning. &ldquo;The lake is a Ramsar site of international importance, supports the livelihoods of about 700,000 residents and is an important bird area, hence the need to protect it,&rdquo; Mbogo said. &ldquo;The Increasing population, expanding economic ventures and overwhelming demand for natural resources, especially water, have caused major impacts on water availability and quality of the other environmental services.&rdquo;
