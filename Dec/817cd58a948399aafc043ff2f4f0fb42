US Ambassador Robert Godec yesterday met Laikipia residents hit by banditry and tribal attacks by pastoralists from Samburu and Baringo.Participants who included small scale farmers, representatives from group ranches, community conservancies and the private sector raised concerns about the lack of response by the authorities to the criminal activities perpetrated by the invaders.Godec said he would do all possible with other members of the diplomatic community to assist the Kenya Government to resolve current insecurity issues in Laikipia and to seek long term solutions.He urged civil society to take the lead and hold the perpetrators to account.The US is taking a leading role among Western countries in urging the Kenya government to protect peace ahead of the 2017 elections.The ambassador's visit was also intended to assess threat to US interests in conservancies from armed pastoralists.The British High Commissioner will also be visiting Laikipia next week to meet with victims of lawlessness from the communities invaded by armed trespassers.UK investment in Laikipia runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars in the horticulture and conservation sectors with the Ol Pejeta Conservancy being one of Laikipia's largest employers.The British Army has also invested Sh9 billion in building its Nanyuki base and spends billions more each year in local purchases, leases etc.Western diplomats are sufficiently worried about events in Laikipia that if the situation fails to improve, there may be the possibility of travel advisories advising caution to international tourists thinking of travel to the county.The Kenya Private Sector Alliance met with members of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security on Tuesday regarding the economic impact of lawlessness in Laikipia.The committee members expressed dismay at the revelations about invasion of private properties and the level of impunity shown by trespassers and livestock rustlers.
