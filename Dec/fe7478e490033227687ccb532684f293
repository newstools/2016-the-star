ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi will lead the opposition against President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2017 general election.On Sunday he said the National Super Alliance is his brainbrain, and he will settle for nothing less than being its flagbearer.&ldquo;I came up with the NASA idea and invited my friends ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Kanu&rsquo;s Gideon Moi, CCM&rsquo;s Isaac Rutto and others so that can they support me to unseat President Uhuru,&rdquo; Mudavadi told supporters in Mumias town.He asked trade unions, civil society and youth and women&rsquo;s groups across the country to join him in removing Jubilee from power &ldquo;because they are corrupt, inept, tribal and have failed to unite Kenyans&rdquo;.Mudavadi accused the Jubilee administration of sidelining some regions. He said Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto are only busy developing their backyards. Mudavadi said there is too much &ldquo;wayward politics&rdquo; and the county needs divine intervention.&ldquo;That is why I have come to pray with you here at Mumias ACK and seek your blessings. I also seek support from the Wanga community, which produced a paramount chief in the history of our country,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi said Kenyans are fed up with the Jubilee leadership and told Uhuru and Ruto to prepare to vacate office in 2017.&ldquo;Let all Kenyans register as voters in huge numbers to ensure we beat Jubilee with a huge margin. We need all your votes,&rdquo; he said.
