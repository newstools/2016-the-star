The Kenya Rugby fraternity is coming to terms with the death of another player, after Mwamba RFC scrum-half Victor 'yoods' Wayodi passed on Saturday. Wayodi collapsed on the pitch after developing breathing difficulties while playing against Nakuru RFC in the Kenya cup round six tie at the Impala club which ended in a 10-10 stalemate.The 24 year old was rushed to Nairobi women's hospital but succumbed to cardiac arrest while undergoing treatment."Wayodi collapsed during the match and was rushed to the hospital but unfortunately he passed on as a result of cardiac arrest," said Mwamba communications officer, Collins Nabiswa.Wayodi had earlier pulled a back injury during the Impala Floodlit Tournament, that saw him miss the first two months of action. Mwamba rallied from behind from 0-10 deficit at half time to score in the 55th minute through Humphrey Kayange and a drop goal from Lavin Asego 3 minutes later. Goeffrey Ominde drilled in a penalty in the 33rd minute before George Odongo picked up a lose pass and smiled all the way to the try box. Ominde added the extras for Wanyore as they took a 10-0 lead at the breather. This comes barely a week after Nondescript's center Ogeto Gecheo succumbed to breathing problems after undergoing spine surgery, he suffered the injury during their match against Strathmore Leos at Madaraka grounds. Gecheo who was plucked by the cruel hand of death aged only 19 will be laid to rest on Monday in Njoro. Both players were Maseno alumnus, where they horned their rugby skills, before joining their respective clubs.
