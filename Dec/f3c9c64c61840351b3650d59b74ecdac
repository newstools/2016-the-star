A Mwingi North engineer has said he will punish area MP John Munuve for "disrespecting" Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and "betraying" him by joining Jubilee.Paul Nzengu who lost to the incumbent said Munuve is plotting to divide the Kamba vote.On Thursday, he said, "If we were to conduct a by -election, I am sure I would win since Munuve has already been disowned by Wiper. He has totally failed to deliver the promises he made to the people who elected him." Nzengu accused Munuve of engaging Kalonzo in a supremacy battle. He said Munuve lacks an agenda.
