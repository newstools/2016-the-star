It has been a week dominated by the education sector. First we had the results of the KCPE national exam &ndash; and in a giant step forward for a credible exam system, there was barely any cheating under the new system for guarding exam papers.Then we had the graduation ceremony for the University of Nairobi.Both these should really serve to remind us of a continuing tragedy within our country: That there are hundreds of thousands of young Kenyans who cannot find employment &ndash; of whom thousands hold university degrees.This is the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; within which all this celebration of &ldquo;clean exams&rdquo; and the hosting of graduation parties should be seen.These are young people who are (mostly) playing by the rules; studying seriously; aspiring to various careers and professions &ndash; and then just when they get to the top of the academic ladder, they find that it does not lead to the jobs they had dreamt of.
