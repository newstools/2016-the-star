For the last few days Kenyans have witnessed violence across the country as the ruling Jubilee Party has picked its interim officials in the counties through a selection process.Amid all the chaos it is clear the process bodes ill for free and fair nominations when the time comes for the mega party to produce candidates for the 12th General Election. Sadly, violence has been a key factor and confrontation has replaced competition. What does this say about political parties and preparations for the election? If the ruling JP cannot get its act together at the selection of interim officials stage, how then can the membership trust that the nominations will be free and fair? Flawed nominations lead straightaway to flawed elections and subversion of the people&rsquo;s political will. Violence borders on criminality. The police need to make arrests. Internally, JP must discipline offenders and redeem its image, even if means repeating the entire interim officials selection process.
