Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa has urged students to pursue life-long education, saying there is no age limit in learning. He urged them to emulate Agriculture executive Moses Mwanje Osia, 43, who recently acquired a PhD in Strategic Management. &ldquo;It confirms county officers are people who have gone to school, contrary to skeptics who believe most of them are handpicked without due qualifications. It is encouraging to hear Osia graduated together with his son, Bon Aaron, who acquired his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mass Communication. This is the way to go,&rdquo; Wangalwa said.Osia also urged the youth not to limit their education. &ldquo;Patience, humility and discipline paid off dividends for me since 2011, when I started pursuing my third degree. I have achieved it by God&rsquo;s grace. I spent more time praying for it. My key verse is Proverbs 3:5-6, which urges the need to trust in the Lord,&rdquo; he said.
