Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo’s much-awaited announcement of the person he will endorse for Siaya governor failed to take place on Saturday. He was supposed to make the announcement during his parents’ memorial service, but failed to do so when Cord leader Raila Odinga arrived. Midiwo is a critic of the incumbent Cornel Rasanga, while Raila is seen to support the governor. Present at the service were Ida Odinga, deputy governors Ruth Odinga (Kisumu) and Wilson Ouma (Siaya), MPs Oburu Oginga (nominated), Shakeel Shabbir (Kisumu East), Paul Otuoma (Funyula), Olago Aluoch (Kisumu West) and Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda). The event started with speakers criticising Rasanga’s administration, but they toned it down when Raila arrived. The speakers instead talked about the need to support Raila’s presidential bid.
