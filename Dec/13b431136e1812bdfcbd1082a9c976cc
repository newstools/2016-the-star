Lamu politician Rishad Amana has accused incumbent county leaders of sleeping on their job. He accused them of failing to defend the people of Lamu on their basic rights and common problems such as land issues and access to national IDs. He said the leaders have failed in resolving common problems in Lamu county. Amana, who has announced his bid for the Lamu West MP seat on an ODM party ticket in 2017, said for decades, Lamu residents have suffered historical injustices and very little has changed. Speaking in Lamu on Sunday, Amana expressed discontent over the silence by Lamu&rsquo;s leaders over discrimination of certain tribes during the issue of ID cards and title deeds. He challenged Governor Issa Timamy, Senator Abu Chiaba, Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa and Lamu East MP Athman Shariff to fight for the people.
