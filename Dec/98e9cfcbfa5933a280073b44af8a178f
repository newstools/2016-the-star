Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has named Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and two other elected leaders in a case of land grabbing. Mutua tabled a report before the Senate Finance committee on Wednesday, saying Kalonzo Musyoka,&nbsp; Mavoko MP Patrick Makau and an unnamed Senator were linked to the crime. "Land is being grabbed in Mavoko and I am trying to stop it, but there are cartels funded by senior politicians," he told the committee. He said&nbsp; he had written to the Ethics Anti Corruption Commission regarding an investigation. Mutua asked the EACC to investigate Makau last year, claiming he was involved in an attempt to grab 13,000 acres of the company's land. He said the MP was among senior officials involved in "massive corruption" concerning the East African Portland Cement Company property."We are aware that interested groups involving senior government o&#64259;cials and brokers are involved in a plot to grab and sell o&#64256; the land," Mutua said.Read: Mutua accuses Mavoko MP of landgrabbing, asks EACC to investigate
