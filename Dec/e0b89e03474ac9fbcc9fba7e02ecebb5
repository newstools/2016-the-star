The High Court yesterday ruled President Uhuru Kenyatta violated children&rsquo;s rights in ordering compilation of names of all schoolchildren living with HIV and Aids.Justice Isaac Lenaola declared Uhuru&rsquo;s directive on February 23 last year a violation of children&rsquo;s rights to privacy and their best interests.However, he said that in issuing the order the President had intended to provide more and better services and support to those children and HIV-positive pregnant women.Lenaola gave Health CS Cleopa Mailu and Interior CS Joseph Nkaiserry 45 days to codify all names collected as a result of the directive.They are not to be destroyed.The names should be stored in a manner that does not link the names and their HIV status in a public document.The urgent directive ordered all county commissioners to prepare a report with names of all schoolchildren living with HIV and Aids, information on their guardians, number of expectant mothers who are HIV positive and breastfeeding mothers who are infected. The information was to be gathered in a format directly linking names and HIV status.The petitioners were the Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network (Kelin), Children of God Relief Institute (Nyumbani) and two adults living with HIV and AIDS. They said the compilation would stigmatise children and adults. They also said there was no consultation in implementing the directive.Further, they said that nine years after enactment of the HIV and Aids Prevention and Control Act, the Health CS has failed to publish regulations on proper collection and storage of HIV-related data.The judge said, &ldquo;While none of the petitioners had any qualms with the directive and its intentions, their difficulties lie in its implementation...The question is what reliefs are available for the petitioners?&rdquo;Lenaola said it was unclear to the court whether any data was collected and if so, whether the National Aids Control Council has custody of it.He said the data is useful in putting in place specific strategies to target affected persons and ensure they individually receive treatment and care.&ldquo;To destroy the data would be akin to throwing away the baby with the bath water,&rdquo; the judge said.Lenaola said disclosure of identities and HIV status is a clear violation of the law. He said the court cannot direct the executive on which policies to enact or how to undertake that policy making mandate.
