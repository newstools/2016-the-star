Armed cattle rustlers have continued to terrorise various parts of Laikipia West constituency, even as police evict illegal grazers from the area. Yesterday, the rustlers raided several homes in the Ol Moran and Survey areas, where they stole 65 sheep. They first raided the home of Patrick Mucheke, a person living with disability, and stole his 12 sheep. Mucheke said rustlers stormed his home at around 7pm and shot at his house several times. They then broke into the house and took away the sheep, he said. This has been my only source of livelihood as I am disabled, Mucheke said.
