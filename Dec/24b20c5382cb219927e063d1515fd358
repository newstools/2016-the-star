A Senate committee has found Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko guilty of verbally assaulting Governor Evans Kidero and says he should be made to apologise.The Public Accounts Committee also confirmed there was a scuffle between Sonko and Kidero on June 15 but it said it did not fulfil the definition of actual danger.Sonko wants to run against Kidero for governor. The committee absolved Sonko of allegations he physically assaulted Kidero on June 15. The recommendations are in its investigations report tabled last Thursday.Sonko had called Kidero a murder and a thief in land disputes and previously refused to say sorry. &ldquo;In view of evidence adduced, the committee found the allegation of verbal assault made by Kidero against Sonko substantiated,&rdquo; chairman and Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o said. He went on, &ldquo;Based on findings and having reviewed the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, the committee recommended disciplinary action against Sonko by requiring him to apologise to the Senate at the Bar of the Senate.&rdquo;The report said physical assault involves a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person that puts the person in immediate danger or in apprehension of such harm or contact.&ldquo;The committee found there was indeed a scuffle between Kidero and Sonko but the allegation of physical assault was not substantiated,&rdquo; it said. The committee recommended the Hansard record reflecting the altercation and allegations made by Sonko against Kidero be expunged from committee records.In June, Kidero filed a complaint, with Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro citing &ldquo;undignified treatment&rdquo; during a meeting with the EACC.Kidero and his officers were being questioned over 2013-14 spending. Trouble started when Sonko made a presentation on land rates, which he called illegal. He said a woman was evicted from her Sh2 million property and murdered.
