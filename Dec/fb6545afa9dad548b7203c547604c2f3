KPMG kicked off the audit of the voter register on Friday, a process that will end on January 18, 2017.IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba said the firm will submit a report to Parliament on February 1.The methodology of the process has not been defined but Chiloba said it was a requirement of the new electoral laws.KPMG is expected to apply some of the best practices used across the world in an attempt to clean up the register.The law requires the IEBC to implement the audit's recommendations by February 17, two days after the end of the next mass voter registration exercise.Mass Voter Registration (MVR) is scheduled to start on January 16 locally and on February 1 for those in the diaspora. The exercise will end on February 15."We target to register six million additional voters by the 2017 General Election. This will require support and goodwill from all Kenyans," said Chiloba.More on this: Electoral agency to audit voter register 6 months to pollsRead: IEBC sets new election timelinesThe expression of interest advertisement for the audit attracted 11 firms, six of which were asked to submit proposals within 14 days.Four firms presented technical and financial proposals, two of which were technically responsive, leading to the opening of financial bids.Cord had claimed the electoral body is seeking to water down the level of the audit envisioned in law, and has asked the commission to shelve the plan."They cannot undertake this extremely important exercise in the absence of the new commissioners who are going to be held responsible and accountable to the people of Kenya for the conduct of the general election next year," warned Siaya Senator James Orengo.Elections (Amendment) Act 2016 also makes it mandatory that no later than 90 days before the August 8, 2017 polls, the IEBC must open the register of voters for verification of biometric data by the public.That at polling stations is scheduled to take 30 days.More on this: IEBC sets new election timelinesAlso read: IEBC trying to block new election law, claims Cord
