Kenya Science students have threatened demonstrations if the government does not go back on its decision to to relocate the institution. Education CS Fred Matiang&#39;i &nbsp;decided to evacuate the University of Nairobi campus in favour of the Kenya Technical Teachers College. But the students said they that relocation, which was to take effect today,&nbsp;was irrational. They noted that the campus&nbsp;has well equipped laboratories that are essential for their studies.&quot;We have modern laboratories that lend tot he achievement of vision 2030,&quot; said s tudent union chairman Babu Owino. Babu told the press that the government has a week to revoke the decision. &quot;We warn that they are not going to take this institution away from us. Any attempt to do so will have severe consequences. The demonstrations will be violent,&quot; he said&quot;We shall not be intimidated by the government. If they want they can deploy all GSU officers to the institution. We are ready to defend our college.&quot; The Commission on Administrative Justice said on November 29 that the relocation should be halted as the CS had not consulted all stakeholders. In a letter seen by the Star, the commission said the directive by the CS contravenes requirements of the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015.More on this: Ombudsman wants Matiangi&#39;s stopped from moving Kenya Science collegeThe institution was established in 1965 through a partnership between the Kenyan and Swedish government, and has a student population of 1,038. &nbsp;
