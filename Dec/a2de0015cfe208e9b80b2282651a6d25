Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero should fence Kikuyu Springs, which supply water to Nairobi, to prevent contamination and keep off intruders, Kikuyu Town MCA Binary Wainaina has said.&ldquo;Trucks of garbage collectors were nabbed by Ministry of Public Health officials dumping garbage in the water. This poses a threat. A lot of people drink the water, even though it is treated before being pumped into people&rsquo;s homes,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday. The water is piped to Nairobi, while residents rely on Nyongara and Kabuthi springs and boreholes, Wainaina said.He said Nyongara and Kabuthi springs are well-maintained and managed, but the Kikuyu Springs, managed from Nairobi, are under threat of pollution.The MCA said, &ldquo;Despite the fact that the springs&rsquo; source is Kiambu, our [county] government has not addressed the issue because it does not collect revenue from the water nor does any resident use it.&rdquo;He said he will raise the concern with President Uhuru Kenyatta if Kidero fails to take action.Wainaina urged Environment CS Judi Wakhungu to have the springs gazetted a Ramsar Site as promised by Environment minister John Michuki. A Ramsar Site is a wetland site of international importance.
