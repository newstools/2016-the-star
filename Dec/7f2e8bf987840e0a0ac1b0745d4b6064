Debate by Kakamega MCAs on the supplementary budget estimates broke up in disarray after they argued over money shifted and removed by the executive.On Tuesday temporary speaker Said Omusiritsa adjourned the session to yesterday after the MCAs stood, shouted and became uncontrollable. The estimates presented to the assembly by the executive shows Sh894.5 million has been shifted from various dockets, including from the assembly development budget.The revised budget moved Sh490 million to development and Sh404.5 million for recurrent expenditure.The Kakamega county budgeted for Sh13.2 billion in 2016-17. Out of that amount, Sh6.5 billion was set aside for recurrent expenditure.Some Sh6.7 billion was set for development. The assembly budget for 2016-17 was Sh899,913,088, out of which Sh277 million was earmarked for development.Trouble started when Omusiritsa called Budget and Appropriation Committee chairman Bernard Likulu to table the supplementary estimates.Lukulu instead asked members whether they could debate the estimates. MCAs stood up in protest, saying Lukulu cannot offer debate instead of tabling the estimates, including a committee report. Public Service and Administration chairman Reuben Nyangweso, minority leader Titus Kwomah, nominated MCA Alex Khamasi and Bryson Sikolia accused Lukulu of secretly replacing the committee report with the estimates forwarded by the executive.Nyangweso said it was unprocedural for Lukulu to present executives&rsquo; estimates without footnotes on how money had been moved and why.Kwomah said the executive had removed Sh177 million from the assembly budget, Sh100 million to build new chambers and Sh77 million for assembly staff car loans and mortgages.But Marama West MCA Willis Opuka said the assembly development budget was shifted to the executive &ldquo;because the money could be misused&rdquo;.&ldquo;We prefer money for new chambers revert to the executive because MCAs are on recess in two weeks. When we come back it will be campaigning, hence, no one to supervise construction of chambers,&rdquo; he said.Opuka said the assembly service board has already wasted Sh100 million by hastily commissioning the chambers on disputed land, which has been stopped by the court.Revised estimates also cut money for reducing maternal deaths from Sh90 million to Sh50 milllion.
