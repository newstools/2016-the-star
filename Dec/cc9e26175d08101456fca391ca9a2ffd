A pre-election agreement to share JP interim party positions among the 17 subcounties in Nairobi was the secret behind the peaceful branch elections, a legislator has said.Starehe MP Maina Kamanda on Thursday said the branch also adhered to the election guidelines released by the party&rsquo;s national headquarters.&ldquo;Sitting MPs, including the senator, constituted 30 per cent of the delegates. Sitting MCAs had 30 per cent and aspirants constituted the remaining 40 per cent. This was the guideline. We followed it and it worked,&rdquo; he said.The JP elections in other parts of the country, especially in Rift Valley and Central Kenya, the party&rsquo;s perceived strongholds, have been marred by chaos. Nineteen interim officials were elected during the polls held at the JP City branch headquarters at Waruku in Westlands on Wednesday. They will run the party&rsquo;s affairs ahead of next year&rsquo;s general election.&ldquo;The people we elected represent the face of Kenya, the face of Nairobi and the subcounties,&rdquo; Kamanda said.Those seeking elective posts at the 2017 election were barred from running for the party positions. Suntus Ndegwa from Embakasi Central was elected chairperson. John Njoroge from Roysambu was elected deputy chairperson in charge of operations and David Muchai from Lang&rsquo;ata deputy in charge of programmes, while Mary Anne from Makadara is deputy chairperson in charge of strategy. The secretary position went to Antony Samba from Westlands subcounty.Samba will be deputised by John Kamau from Mathare, John Kimani from Dagoretti South and Francis Njoroge from Roysambu. They will be in charge of operations, strategy and programmes respectively.Cecilia Wairimu from Starehe is the branch treasurer and will be assisted by Francis Wambua (Makadara), Joseph Matunda (Starehe) and Francis Wambua (Makadara).
