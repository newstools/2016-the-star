The High Court yesterday directed Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo to record a statement with the police on her threat case.Justice James Wakiaga said the MP should be accompanied by her lawyers to the Parliament police station and the police should not arrest her. Wakiaga directed the case be mentioned before a different judge on January 10 next year.Odhiambo moved to court for anticipatory bail over remarks she made in Parliament as MPs met to debate the contentious amendments to electoral laws.The legislator on December 21 is alleged to have made remarks that Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is a fake President and that his own backyard is poor.She was enraged after police ordered MPs to walk to Parliament as cars were not allowed within the precincts of the House.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come here prepared for death. We&rsquo;re going to Canaan and not back to Egypt,&rdquo; Odhiambo said ahead of the stormy debate. &ldquo;I dedicate this day to telling the President all the negative things I have. We fought for this country as he was in a foreign land. So, he can&rsquo;t dictate his powers to me or any other elected MP.&rdquo;Earlier, the Director of Public Prosecutions, through senior assistant counsel Moses Omirera, said he was not ready to proceed with the matter. He said it was not clear whether it was the police or strangers trailing the legislator.In a suit filed On December 23, Millie says she lives in fear as security agents have issued threats against her. She urged the court to stop the DPP and the Inspector General of Police from arresting her, pending the conclusion of the case. Odhiambo said she has been vilified for lawfully and constitutionally exercising her rights and freedoms.
