A workers union yesterday demanded the county assembly leadership account for Sh161 million it says it was given by the Transition Authority to build offices.The Kenya County Government Workers Union accused speaker Alex Magelo and clerk Jacob Ngwele of evicting members from the fourth and fifth floors of the City Hall Northern Wing. Nairobi branch union secretary Benson Oriaro said despite the duo having received the money and space to put up the offices, they &ldquo;unprocedurally&rdquo; gazetted the wing as county assembly precincts.He threatened to petition the Senate to investigate how the assembly spent the money. The assembly and the executive have been at loggerheads over the offices since 2013. The assembly says it rightfully owns the offices after the IEBC in 2013 gazetted the wing as county assembly precincts.The executive, says, however, the assembly is illegally evicting its workers. It has moved to court and blocked the assembly from taking over the offices. &ldquo;We may not be lawyers but the law is clear on procedures to be followed. We haven&rsquo;t seen a property gazetted twice and even if you must do so, consultation is a priority,&rdquo; Oriaro said. He added that the security of 160,000 property records worth more than Sh7 billion will be jeopardised and the county will lose billions of shillings in revenue if the 2,000 employees are evicted from the offices.Oriaro said it will cost the county Sh5 billion and take 36 months to relocate the workers successfully. Magelo, however, denied the assembly was given money to build the offices. &ldquo;Who gave us the money? Can they prove that? The TA was giving us money for operation for the three months we didn&rsquo;t have the budget. Even so, the money was channelled through the executive,&rdquo; he said.
