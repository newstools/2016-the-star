Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Saturday skipped the celebrations of the International Day of People Living with Disability, despite having been invited.The county government was not represented at the function held in Migori Primary School, as a standoff looms over outstanding funds for the PWDs. Speakers, led by nominated MCA Eunice Mboya, a representative of the PWDs in the county assembly, castigated the governor. Last week on Monday, a group of angry PWDs invaded Obado&rsquo;s office in Migori town and spent the night in the compound before protesting in Migori town on Tuesday.They vowed to force the county to release Sh20millon allocated to them in the last financial year. Obado, through county secretary Christopher Rusana and Governor Press director Nicholas Anyuor, last week said the delay has been caused by the assembly, which is yet to formulate a policy. But Mboya said they want the money with or without the policy.
