A cigarette-smoking chimpanzee that was separated from his mother in Africa and smuggled to the war-torn Iraq, is now recuperating in Nanyuki.The chimp, christened Manno, spent his days smoking cigarettes to impress visitors who would then dole out food to him, in a private zoo in Dohuk, close to the hot-spots of the ISIS war.Visitors accounts claim the four-year-old was dressed as a child and fed soda and sweets giving him near permanent diarrhoea while guests entertained themselves by taking selfies.Manno was rescued from Iraq early this month and was taken to the the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary, in Ol Pejeta, Nanyuki.He is now being kept in isolation for 90 days as veterinarians conduct a battery of tests so that he does not bring diseases to Kenya.Stephen Ngulu, a veterinarian and the chimp sanctuary&rsquo;s director, said Manno was depressed when he came in but has recovered."He plays, he moves around constantly, he is very excited by what we give him," he said.Kenya Wildlife Service Chief veterinarian Dr Edward Kariuki said the major worry was that the chimp could be carrying ebola from his original home in Central Africa.However, tests done before relocation from Iraq showed he is healthy and was also vaccinated for various diseases including tuberculosis.Dr Kariuki said Manno's period of isolation in Nanyuki might be shortened if vets give him a clean bill of health."I think being young, he has a future in him. It's very easy to forget he still has a long life after, and if that life is comfortable and less distressing, then we expect good healing,&rdquo; Dr Kariuki told Al Jazeera.Manno was relocated with help from several conservation groups who spent Sh1 million.He arrived on November 30 at Ol Pejeta conservancy in a small wooden box."The reason we are doing this is not because we want to take chimps from other countries," Kariuki says,"but we are doing this in practice of law enforcement and the fact [that] we like to protect and conserve wildlife species."
