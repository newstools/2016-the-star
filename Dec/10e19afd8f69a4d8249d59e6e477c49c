Farmers in the Mumias sugar zone have threatened to boycott supplying cane to Mumias Sugar Company &ldquo;for being ignored by the government&rdquo;.The company held its annual general meeting on December 9 and elected a new board of directors.&ldquo;But we were shocked to realise the candidates from Western whom we elected were dropped by the Treasury. Instead, people who didn&rsquo;t present themselves before the shareholders and stakeholders were included on the list of directors,&rdquo; farmer Musa Ekaya said.James Wakungwi and Alfred Amulioto were elected during the AGM but they were dropped from the final list published by the government on Monday.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said Wakungwi was fronted to sit on the board to articulate the real problems affecting sugar cane farmers.&ldquo;Many of the directors come from areas where cane is not grown. They don&rsquo;t understand what farmers go through to produce sugar cane. They simply don&rsquo;t understand what cane farming is about," Washiali said."Their interest is simply to make money. We wanted directors from the zone to present and address real issues affecting farmers." Washiali said Mumias faces cane shortage because farmers have been neglected.&ldquo;Cane farmers have been demoralised because no one is addressing their grievances. All the focus is on money, without considering where sugar cane will come from,&rdquo; he said.Ekaya said Mumias Sugar was constructed on land whose inhabitants were evicted without compensation. He accused the government of double standards in reviving the company.&ldquo;On one part, the government claims to be pumping money towards revival of the company. On the other hand, it doesn&rsquo;t want to listen to the grievances of people directly affected by the company. How will the revival succeed if residents are ignored,&rdquo; Ekaya said.He said for Mumias to survive, all stakeholders should put their heads together and move towards one direction.
