The driver of the fire engine that ran over former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi has been denied bail by the High Court in Kitui.Philip Isika was charged on Monday with two counts; killing Ex- Mayor Martha Mwangangi and with an intention of wanting to kill Narc leader Charity Kaluki Ngilu on December 15, 2016. Isika will remain behind bars until December 28 when the case will be mentioned.Judge Rose Ombeta said that she arrived at the decision after the state counsel Martin Wanjala argued that the release of the accused may cause him personal harm from the wrath of angry residents.The prosecution also said he might interfere with the witnesses.Isika was arrested at Kitui Ginnery soon after the Friday incident.The two were leading protests against the demolition of kiosks at Kalundu market.Kitui governor Julius Malombe ordered that the kiosks be brought down.The driver of the fire engine was trying to scare away the protesters who wanted to set a county vehicle ablaze before tragedy struck.The lot, which barricaded roads leading to the market, accused Governor Malombe&rsquo;s government of illegally demolishing a source of their livelihood.Also read: Malombe, Ngilu row over death of ex-mayor
