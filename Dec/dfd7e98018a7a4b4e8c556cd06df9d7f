The Wiper governing council will today endorse its leader Kalonzo Musyoka as its presidential candidate as he seeks to run against other Cord presidential hopefuls to fly the coalition&rsquo;s flag at next year&rsquo;s election.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama yesterday told the Star the endorsement will place Kalonzo in a better position to be the Cord candidate.ODM leader Raila Odinga and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula were endorsed last month by their own national delegates to square it off for the top seat. &ldquo;Each party has its own presidential candidate. They will only be sorted out at the Cord level. At the moment, each party has to nominate and push for its presidential candidate,&rdquo; Muthama said.The Wiper NGC meeting will be held in the Kasarani Stadium, Nairobi. Muthama did not confirm if delegates will also discuss the future of five expelled Wiper rebel members, including Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua.&ldquo;They were nominated and supported by the party but are working against its policies,&rdquo; he said.Muthama said the party&rsquo;s disciplinary committee has dealt with the rebels&rsquo; matter &ldquo;conclusively and we are not going back to that.&rdquo; Elected leaders expelled for decamping to the Jubilee Party include Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), John Munuve (Mwingi North), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Richard Makenga (Kaiti).
