Judges and magistrates should examine their conduct and improve on matters that impede the Judiciary&rsquo;s war on corruption, Chief Justice David Maraga has said.He urged the police, Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to up their game in the war on graft &ldquo;if they expect the judges and magistrates to rule in their favour&rdquo;.The CJ spoke at the Milimani law courts as he launched the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division of the High Court.He said the fight against corruption is a collaborative effort from all agencies and institutions mandated by the Constitution. He added that the blame game should come to an end and they must identify the lapses and fix them immediately.&ldquo;The war on corruption requires a multi-faceted effort of credible and proper investigation by the police and the EACC, and proper prosecution and submission of evidence by the DPP. Only then can the courts deliver convictions,&rdquo; Maraga said.The CJ also took issue with how the police handle their investigations. The DPP should not initiate or charge a suspect if investigations are not complete, or if witnesses are not ready, he said.His message to his fellow actors in the justice chain was &ldquo;give us evidence, and we shall convict. If you fail to furnish us with evidence beyond reasonable doubt, we shall acquit. This is not a failure of the court system but a miscarriage of the investigative and prosecutorial machinery&rdquo;.Maraga urged officials to stop blaming the courts when cases collapse due to taking accused persons to court to manage political pressure when investigations are not concluded, or when those investigations are casually done, or drawing up faulty charge sheets.&ldquo;I have asked our judges and magistrates to make it clear in their judgments who should take responsibility for failures in corruption cases. We all must be accountable,&rdquo; he said.The CJ said he will not allow adjournment of corruption cases meant to delay the outcome of the hearings. He reiterated that hearing of graft cases will proceed on a daily basis with no room for adjournment, except in compelling and exceptional circumstances.The Law Society of Kenya must also rein in members to uphold the spirit of such practice by not taking up frivolous briefs and misleading the courts to get adjournments, Maraga said. &ldquo;It is unethical for an advocate to apply for an adjournment in the morning, and later in the afternoon, in a fit of falsified fury, address a press conference blaming the judiciary for delaying cases and rising backlogs,&rdquo; he added.
