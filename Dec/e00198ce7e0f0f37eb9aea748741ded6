Orange Telkom head coach Jos Openda said seeking the services of Wekesa wouldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time as dependable defender Betsy Omala participation in the event is a doubt.Omala has been away from both the national team and club championship assignment for the better part of the season due top personal commitment. &ldquo;Our defence in the 2016 season was not threatened as much but it&rsquo;s one of the areas that we are working on besides our forward department,&rdquo; noted the former national team head coach.He added: &ldquo;Omala is a utility player who I would love to have in the team but as per now, I can&rsquo;t really confirm if she will be part of the squad or not. Wekesa has shown positivity in training and I am happy to have her in the team even as we look forward to defend the club championship title we won last year in Lusaka, Zambia,&rdquo;Openda, who alongside former most sought after national team goal keeper Josephine Ataro and Rose Ngulo recently guided Orange Telkom to retain the KHU women&rsquo;s league title a record 19 time, however said there is no time to rest.Openda said retaining the national title is boost but defending the Africa title will even be better. &ldquo;We will not be resting during this festive season. The club championship is set for between January 7-15 in Nairobi and our focus is to win the title. We are currently training at the City Park Stadium under floodlights on Tuesday and Thursday and we are looking to increase the hours of training,&rdquo; noted openda.He continued: &ldquo;Just so that we can gauge our performance ahead of the club championship, we will be fielding the team to the this weekend&rsquo;s Jamhuri Open in Kisumu and also participate in the next week&rsquo;s 2nd edition of the Heroes Memorial tournament at the City Park Stadium.&rdquo;Orange Telkom alongside Sliders will represent the country in the Africa show while former champions Butali Sugar Warriors and Kenya Police will do duty for the nation in the men&rsquo;s category.
