A 30-year-old man died on Monday morning after he jumped into the Indian Ocean waters at the Likoni Ferry. The unidentified man is said to have jumped into the ocean when MV Likoni was moving from the mainland to the island. Likoni police boss Willy Simba, who confirmed the incident, said the deceased did not have any identification papers on him, making it hard to immediately identify him. Simba said Kenya Ferry Services divers rescued him immediately and gave him first aid, but he later died. His body was taken to the Coast General Hospital mortuary. Cases of attempted suicide have been on the rise at the channel in recent months. Simba said most of the cases have been due to marital issues.
