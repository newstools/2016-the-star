The US Department of Justice has sued Barclays Plc and two former executives on civil charges of fraud in the sale of mortgage-backed securities during the run-up to the 2008-09 financial crisis. The lawsuit was filed after Barclays resisted a penalty the US government had sought in settlement negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said. The person would not disclose the government&rsquo;s demand. Major US banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp , have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle similar claims over misconduct in the sale and pooling of mortgage securities, which helped to cause the financial crisis. Barclays was among a handful of European banks still under investigation by the Justice Department, according to company disclosures. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are also in settlement talks, sources have said.
