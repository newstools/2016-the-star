Returns on savings with commercial banks more than doubled in the first two weeks of the implementation of the interest rate cap law, fresh statistics from the Central Bank shows.The data collated by state statistician, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, indicate commercial banks investors&rsquo; interest on savings increased to 3.79 per cent in September from an average of 1.68 per cent in August.This comes after the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016 was effected on September 14.Average interest on term deposits rose marginally to 6.91 per cent from 6.42 per cent in August. Fixed-term deposit, which has maturity date, earns higher interest than regular savings.The amended law set payable deposits to at least 70 per cent of the base rate set by the CBK. This translates to a seven per cent minimum interest rate since the CBK&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee retained the Central Bank Rate at 10 per cent in its meeting on November 28.However, the new law has impacted negatively on borrowers, despite a drop in interest rates for commercial banks loans and advances. The data shows the weighted average recorded in September was 13.84 per cent down from 17.71 per cent in August.Investment firm Cytonn last week said capping interest rates has forced banks to become &ldquo;choosy&rdquo; on who to give credit, preferring to invest in government securities which are risk-free.&ldquo;Private sector credit growth in Kenya slowed for the 15th consecutive month in October. We do not expect the private sector credit growth to pick up as the loan pricing framework brought about by the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016 is rigid and does not accommodate borrowers who cannot fit within the four per cent,&rdquo; Cytonn said in its banking industry report for the third quarter.This was echoed by the StanChart&rsquo;s MNI Business Sentiment Indicator, which showed that firms are worried about a challenging lending environment and a rise in input prices, with fears of price increments in the coming months.&ldquo;The fall in sentiment fits our view on the Kenyan economy &ndash; weaker credit growth and demand, and potentially higher input prices, have been taking their toll on business activity,&rdquo; said Razia Khan, Standard Chartered chief economist for Africa.
