Attorney General Githu Muigai yesterday remarked that the wealth declarations made by public servants add no value to the war on graft (see story on page 2). And he deplored the organised crime characteristics of runaway corruption in Kenya, saying they &ldquo;constipate almost all departments of government&rdquo;. Making the most despairing high-level remarks on the corruption scourge since President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s at the State House Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Summit on October 19, Muigai said the justice system needs mending immediately. The wealth declaration forms should be made public, instead of being placed in the custody of the Speaker of the National Assembly and being held in secret registries inaccessible by the public, researchers, investigators and media. Kenyans are keen to know whether there are public servants who have under-declared or over-declared their wealth. The law that keeps these forms in secret registries should be swiftly amended and their contents brought within the purview of the Access to Information Act, 2016.
