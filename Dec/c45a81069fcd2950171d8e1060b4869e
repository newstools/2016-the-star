The birth of Ray Isaac Simbiri and Ron George Pile on the same day was as unexpected as the political re-alignments in 2002, when Raila Odinga declared Mwai Kibaki "Tosha".Nobody in the family saw the identical twin boys coming. Not even their father Stephen Orot, a doctor at the Veterinary Laboratories in Kabete, who says that the pair is the first in his family.Having not had any experience with twins, his young family faced many challenges in the early years, especially in relation to house helps who would often feed or pay more attention to one twin due to the confusion.SIGN OF NEW BEGINNINGS&ldquo;It was not easy. When one fell sick, the other followed shortly after,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Since they were born around the time Raila endorsed Kibaki for presidency to unseat the dominant Kanu party, the nurses at Bondo District Hospital where they were born nicknamed them Kibaki and Raila as a sign of new beginnings.&rdquo; The twins were born on December 14, 2002, just two weeks before Mwai Kibaki was sworn in as the third president.Ray or Kibaki as he came first and Ron or Raila as nicknamed by the nurses sat for the KCPE exams earlier this year with astounding results.The top candidate countrywide scored 437 marks out of 500. Ray scored 424 marks while Ron scored 414 marks. The twins both went to Aga Khan Primary School, Nairobi, where Ray has broken the record for the highest score in KCPE in the history of the school.BEST PUPIL IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS&ldquo;So far, it also seems like Ray is the best pupil in public schools in Nairobi. Unless we are advised otherwise, this appears to be the case,&rdquo; says Philemon Kilatya, Ray&rsquo;s standard eight class teacher, who also taught him Maths and Science.Between Ray and Ron, there was only one pupil separating them in the ranking with a score of 418. But curiously, Ray and Ron scored the exact same marks in three of the five examined subjects.&ldquo;We both scored a B+ in Science, an A plain in Maths and an A- in Social Studies,&rdquo; Ray explains.At Aga Khan Primary, they were nicknamed RR due to their striking similarities in looks and their first names.RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONRay, who is very religious, has been nicknamed Wabukala (after Eliud Wabukala, the Retired Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop).&ldquo;When the twins were born, I knew that raising them was not going to be easy, so I took the step of naming them after respected men of God back in our village in Kisumu East,&rdquo; Dr Orot says.&ldquo;So I named Ray after Rev Isaac Simbiri and Ron after pastor George Pile.&rdquo; The religious foundation, he says, has paid off, since not only were the boys the best performers, they were also rated the most disciplined at their school.The twins came after the birth of their sister and older brother, &ldquo;then all of a sudden, we had four children. The pressure, both financial and physical, can take a toll,&rdquo; he says.They also have a younger sister and all these years later, the siblings are still fascinated by the twins.&ldquo;We both enjoy studying, have the same friends and love to watch and play football, but Ray supports Manchester United and I support Arsenal. We love to draw and get along very well,&rdquo; Ron says.For them to have posted such impressive marks, they said they stuck to a very strict and demanding timetable that guided them during the holidays and weekends without supervision.They would begin studying at 6.30am, religiously every single day for six days, resting only on Sunday.&ldquo;From 6.30am, we would study until 8.45am, where we would break until 11 am to have tea, play and help with house chores. We would then study until 12.30pm and break again to play, relax and help around the house and resume at 2pm and study until 4pm,&rdquo; Ray says.The timetable was prepared by the boys. &ldquo;We are very self-reliant. In the house, we also help with the chores. Our parents have made it clear that there is no task that only girls can do, so we all chip in,&rdquo; Ray says.HARD TO TELL APARTThough it is challenging to tell one apart from the other, Ray is slightly more outgoing than Ron, who appears more reserved.But this was of little help to both teachers and pupils at Aga Khan Primary, who had a very hard time telling them apart, and it therefore became a rule that they could not be in the same class to make it easier for the teachers, especially.&ldquo;But in the end, the teachers just called us R because they just could not really tell us apart. You have to spend more time with us to see the differences,&rdquo; Ron says.They have a great admiration for their father and as a result, they chose Maseno School, their father&rsquo;s old school, as their first choice.The twins say their first role model is their father, whom they say is very intelligent and also very understanding. They also say that he is quick to guide but he is also a strict disciplinarian.ROLE MODELSWhile many parents will have sleepless nights due to the economic pressure of enrolling a child in a national school, it is much harder for Dr Orot, who has twins.&ldquo;But the good thing is that I have a one-year scholarship from Hon Tim Wanyonyi, the Member of Parliament for Westlands constituency,&rdquo; Ray says.Ray wanted to score 440 marks and be the best student overall. He may not have achieved this ambitious target, but he did manage to be the first at Aga Khan Primary, Nairobi.&ldquo;Hon Wanyonyi gives scholarships to the best boy and girl in each and every primary school in Westlands constituency,&rdquo; Ray adds.Ray says the wheelchair-bound MP, a lawyer by profession, has never allowed his physical limitations to limit his ambitions. &ldquo;He is my second role model after my father,&rdquo; he says.On his part, Ron would like to follow in the footsteps of entrepreneur and philanthropist James Mwangi of Equity.CONSTANT PRESSUREThough it often seems like it is other people who face challenges handling twins, the boys explain that being twins and in the spotlight due to their excellent performance throughout their primary school life can be very challenging.&ldquo;From a very young age, you cannot hide and disappear in the crowd, especially in school. If you do something good one time, you have to keep doing even better because everybody is watching you,&rdquo; Ray says.The pressure notwithstanding, Ray and Ron could not have found better competitors in each other, with Ron saying that they &ldquo;keep each other focused on the goals that we set. That is how we have stayed at the top.&rdquo;Both boys have been called to join Kapsabet Boys High School in Nandi.
