Kuloba and Wakhura join Butali WarriorsStrathmore University men&rsquo;s hockey team players Derrick Kuloba and Constant Wakhura have changed allegiance to Butali Sugar Warriors ahead of next Month&rsquo;s Africa Club Championship and the 2017 Kenya Hockey Union league season.Butali coach Cliffe Okello confirmed the development saying the move could not have come at a better time as they prepare to make their debut in the club Championship next Month in Nairobi.&ldquo;They are good players. They can both play in midfield as well as full back and that is an advantage to us. As a club we are delighted to have them on board as we head into next year&rsquo;s competitions,&rdquo; Okello said.Okello a former national team player said he was aware they will be regarded as underdogs in the Africa championship between January 7-15 in Nairobi but he was quick to note they will be out to make a good impression.&ldquo;We have qualified for the yearly championship twice in a row but we failed to honour the last edition due to some reasons. I am happy that this time around we are going to compete. And therefore we are going to put our best foot forward and hopefully the end results will favour us,&rdquo; observed the tactician.He added: &ldquo;After the end of the season, we didn&rsquo;t have time to rest as we headed straight into training to prepare for the championship. We broke training last Wednesday and we are scheduled to resume training on December 27, Thereafter, we plan to head to Nairobi for residential training in early January.&rdquo;Butali surrendered the KHU title they had won back to back from 2014 to Strathmore University in a penalty shoot out.Okello however observed that goalkeeping was their main undoing in the just ended season. He is optimistic they will have improved on this when the club championship and 2017 season start.&ldquo;Besides goalkeeping being our main let down, I also learned not to underrate opponents,as well as not to be overconfident,&rdquo; noted OkelloIn the African Club Championships, Kenya&rsquo;s representatives will be Butali Sugar and Kenya Police in the men&rsquo;s category. Telkom Orange and Sliders will represent the country in the women&rsquo;s category.
