IEBC chair candidate lawyer Lucas Leperes Naikuni will ensure political parties adhere to 2/3 gender rule to meet the constitutional requirements."Should a party submit a list that is not balanced then you can be assured that we will not accept it," Naikuni said.While appearing before the select panel on Monday, Naikuni said he will also oversee clean up of the voter register by April next year, to remove "dead" and underage voters."If I am appointed the IEBC Chair, I pledge that the voter register will be clean by April. We cannot be using the same register we keep complaining is messed up with people who are alleged to be dead and others under aged," he said.The lawyer further said he will also ensure that all elections equipment are tested before the general election to avoid mishaps during the material day."Having learnt from the 2013 elections, one of my key roles will be to ensure that IT equipment have been tested and people taught how to use them," he said.Naikuni was the fourth nominee to appear before the panel at the County Hall in Nairobi after being shortlisted by IEBC selection panel for the job.The job attracted more than 45 applications occasioned by the resignation of the team that steered the 2013 poll.Read: Eyes on selection panel as interviews for IEBC chair start on MondayThis comes as Cord claimed the Jubilee administration is blackmailing the IEBC Selection panel to nominate Lucas Leperes Naikuni as the next electoral commission boss.Read: Duale alleges plot by Raila to use foreigners, technology to rig 2017 pollMore of this: Cord claims Jubilee fronting Lucas Lemperes to succeed Hassan as new IEBC chairOthers who were interviewed on Monday are former LSK representative at the JSC Florence Mwangangi, Former Mombasa Mayor Taib Ali and High Court advocate Tukero Ole Kina.Read: IEBC Chair Interviews: I will ensure Kenyans in diaspora vote, Mwangangi tells panel
