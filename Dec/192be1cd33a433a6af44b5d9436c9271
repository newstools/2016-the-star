The High Court has ordered the Tana River assembly to involve residents in lawmaking.It has 14 days to find ways of involving the public.The court ruled that a five-day notice of public hearing of the eight bills by the county is unreasonable, insufficient and violates the Constitution.Justice Njoki Mwangi at the High Court in Mombasa directed the assembly not to hold public hearings as scheduled in a notice placed in the Daily Nation. It further said that a declaration to hold public hearings after the passage of the bills denies the petitioner&rsquo;s right to fair hearing.The court also said that by not involving the public in participation of the county bills violates their rights.In October, Ibrahim Wayu filed a case seeking orders to stop the county from tabling the Animal Control Bill, 2016, pending determination of the suit.He accused the county of passing bills without residents&rsquo; input.Wayu said the notice in the Daily Nation did not give residents adequate time to acquire copies of the bills lined up for debate. They include the Bursary Administration Bill and Water Sanitation Services Bill.None of the draft bills had been circulated to the public, he said in an affidavit. &ldquo;Security being the main concern and conflict between the Pokomo and the Orma in Tana River county, the Pokomos have not been given enough time to attend the hearings of the bill,&rdquo; Wayu said. He was also concerned that the county had used an English language newspaper to pass its message, yet the county low literacy levels and most residents have no access to the internet to get the information.
