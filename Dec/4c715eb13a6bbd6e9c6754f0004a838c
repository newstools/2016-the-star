Uasin Gishu county commander Nelson Daliti was appointed two weeks ago, but has been moved to Meru. He swapped positions with Joseph Kina, who will take over in Eldoret.MCAs in the region, including Peter Chomba, have faulted the move, saying crime may increase because new officers will take time to understand the region. &ldquo;The Christmas season is approaching along with election campaigns and they should not have transferred all officers,&rdquo; Chomba said. County commissioner Abdi Hassan has assured residents of tight security.
