"Flight-related allowances are now in the process of being withdrawn. The allowances were withdrawn without any consultation. This has affected us," read the letter.Read: Mbuvi Ngunze resigns as Kenya Airways CEOThe engineers want technical director Martin Haines to resign immediately for not addressing their issues."We have no faith in his leadership capabilities,' they said, adding he lacked skills and experience.The group also said the newly appointed technical maintenance head should not take the position because he "failed spectacularly" in his previous roll as line maintenance head.The engineers further accused the officers, including their HR manager and deputy director, of failing to handle the issues of pay, promotions and shifts.They said they will carry on with the strike until the officials are removed.This comes after Kenya Airways experienced more flight delays on Saturday.
