Several aspirants have shunned ODM because of the huge sums of money charged as nomination fees.Party insiders say many aspirants are yet to return nomination papers to Orange House despite having picked the forms, which is a concern for the party leadership."As a party we are much concerned with this low show, but we have put in place mechanisms to address the issue," a source at Orange House said.Candidates fear the nominations may not be free, fair and transparent even after parting with huge sums of money.The situation is compounded by the fact that Parliament successfully blocked last-minute defections before the general election after it enacted the anti-party hopping law in late August.Under the Election Offences Act, 2016 midwifed by the joint select committee on electoral reforms, aspirants are barred from defecting after losing during primaries of another party.The law was seen as a tactic by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga to block members of their coalitions seeking to vie on other parties if rigged out at the nominations.Those seeking ODM's ticket to run for President will pay a nomination fee of Sh1 million, governors will part with Sh500,000, while senators and MPs will pay Sh250,000.Ward representatives will pay Sh25,000, while those classified under special interest groups, including the disabled, women and youth, will pay Sh15,000.Candidates initially had until November 30 to officially submit their applications but the National Elections Board pushed the deadline forward by a month to December 31.Small parties are angling to pick the spoils from the anticipated nominations fall out in Jubilee and Cord coalitions ahead of the 2017 polls.A number of parties will be waiting on the sidelines to sponsor disgruntled members from the opposition coalition's Cord and the monolithic Jubilee party in areas where the nominations will be disputed.The situation is such serious in Jubilee strongholds with rebel governors Isaac Ruto's Chama Cha Mashinani and Peter Munya's Party of National Unity could reap big from nomination fallouts.Former cabinet minister Nicholas Biwot's New Vision Party alongside the independence party Kanu are also angling for major political benefits especially in the Rift Valley region.There have been fears that in areas with two or more strong candidates in either party, some will move to other parties over nomination fearsSome hopefuls have decided to shun the so-called big parties for regional outfits because they are apprehensive their nominations will not be free, fair and transparent.
