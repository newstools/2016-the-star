GSU officers had to be called in yesterday to calm a crowd of commuters at the Likoni Channel following the breakdown of three ferries.For about five hours, only MV Likoni was operating. The other three ferries &ndash; MV Kwale, Harambee and Nyayo &ndash; developed mechanical problems and had to be withdrawn, sources at the Kenya Ferry Services said.Trouble started at 1pm, when the crowd got bigger and started competing with cars for the only ferry. The KFS, through its Facebook account, said two ferries were withdrawn for safety reasons.&ldquo;Kindly be patient as we wait to resume operations,&rdquo; it said. MV Harambee resumed operation just last week, after a year out of service.It was reportedly repaired at a cost of Sh140 million. The overwhelmed sentries could no longer control the commuters who started jumping out of and into the ferry even before the ferry settled on the ramp on either side of the channel. There were no injuries.GSU officers were then called in. They managed to contain the crowds. However, a driver of a lorry carrying soft drinks lost control of the vehicle, and it partly plunged into the water.An hour later, the three ferries resumed operation after KFS engineers repaired them. KFS managing director Bakari Goa told the Star there are many problems to solve.
