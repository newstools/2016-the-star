Officials of the Kenya National Union of Nurses have been summoned to court to explain why they should not be committed to civil jail for defying orders to call off the strike.Nurses skipped work from Monday, demanding that the June 27, 2013 collective bargaining agreement be implemented.Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa (pictured) directed the Kilimani OCS to assist in producing the 16 listed in the application filed by the Council of Governors. They are Agnes Munderu, Ann Githiong&rsquo;o, Asha Ali Ido, Charles Alisoreng, Damo Kwaraa, Fredrick Oigo, George Shiveka, Henry Adolwa, John Bii, John Gachara, Joseph Ngwasi, Maurice Opetu, Purity Matu, Seth Panyako and Stephen Rutere. According to court documents, Justice Nelson Abuodha had suspended a strike notice on December 1. The 30-day strike notice was issued on November 14. The judge also directed that the parties negotiate to resolve outstanding issues arising from the 2013 CBA. However, on December 5, the union and its members proceeded on strike.The CoG said the nurses have proceeded on an unlawful and unprotected strike and Kenyans will suffer if it is not called off.The continued disobedience of the order, it said, is watering down the integrity of the court and making Kenyans lose faith in the authority of the Judiciary.&ldquo;No one is above the law. It is essential that court orders are obeyed for maintenance of good order,&rdquo; the council said.
