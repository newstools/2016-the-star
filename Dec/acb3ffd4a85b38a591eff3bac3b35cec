The Western Elders&rsquo; Council has supported Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli&rsquo;s efforts to identify a Luhya spokesman.The candidates are Musalia Mudavadi, Cyrus Jirongo and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula &mdash; and results of an opinion poll will be announced.Chairman Philip Masinde urged all residents to back Atwoli. He said this will give the region political and economic direction, even after next year&rsquo;s general election.&ldquo;We appreciate your efforts in trying democratically, through university researchers, to help us all have someone acceptable from among us as our point man,&rdquo; Masinde said.He spoke at a meeting with the Kakamega County elders&rsquo; council at the Kakamega Sports Club on Monday attended by Atwoli. On December 31, Atwoli will name the community&rsquo;s spokesman in the Muliro Gardens, Kakamega.Who will it be?He hired the University of Nairobi&rsquo;s economics and research department to help identify the strongest among the three big names who have declared interest in running for president next year. Competition and lack of a Western candidate has threatened to split the Luhya vote.&ldquo;I took this initiative because the community has become a laughing stock. I started this journey in 2012. I took Mudavadi, Jirongo and Wetang&rsquo;ula to a secluded location in August and last year and asked then to agree [on one spokesman]. But they said they wanted more meetings,&rdquo; Atwoli said.He said any politician who resists the research findings will face the wrath of the community. The elders also supported the search for opposition unity ahead of the election. They said they appreciate political parties merging, adding that the process should be peaceful.
