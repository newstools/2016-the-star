Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and his Mining counterpart Dan Kazungu on Thursday hailed Cord for calling off the January 4 demos against the amended election laws.The two, who also lauded the Senate for their wisdom on the matter, said Kenya cannot be driven by mass action as it normally leads to 'bloody violence and war'.Wamalwa said mass action was what led to post election violence in 2007/08, which caused the death of more that 1,300 people and displaced some 650,000."We want peace and stability in the country. The economy of the Coast region depends on tourism. Without peace, it will be affected," he said.Kazungu asked Kenyans to desist from being cheated to take part in any mass action for whatever cause that borders on a politician's individual interests."Do not join the groups calling for mass action. If the country resorts to such, people will suffer and livelihoods will be destroyed," he said.Kazungu said the Senate and National Assembly were following the matter and expressed optimism that through dialogue, the issue will be resolved.The CSs asked leaders to give the senate time to conclude their public hearings on the matter, and urged Kenyans to concentrate on development issues.The leaders spoke while on a tour of stalled irrigation projects that are set to be revived along River Sabaki in Malindi constituency.On Tuesday, Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro directed the legal affairs committee to seek public views on the laws and issue a report on January 4.On Thursday, Cord suspended the planned demos to pave way for the senate committee to conclude the tasks assigned by the Speaker.Read: Ethuro pushes election laws debate to January 4, orders public participationAlso read: Cord calls off January 4 demos, lauds Senate for inviting public input on election laws
