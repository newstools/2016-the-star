Ulinzi Stars&rsquo; striker Mark Bikokwa will not be part of the team&rsquo;s 2017 roster as he will be attending courses at the Kenya Defence Forces&rsquo; Military Recruits Training School in Eldoret.Club assistant coach Benjamin Nyangweso said on the KPL official portal that the upcoming youngster has been picked to take part in training that will last slightly over six months. Nyangweso, however, said the striker will be eligible to play for the club immediately he returns, provided he is fit and ready to take up the challenge.&ldquo;That is a very important course he is attending but he will be back once he completes the training. He is not the only one, there are several other men and women from the military who have been picked for the course.&ldquo;It is a routine exercise which one must attend and we can only have him back once he is done. The course itself will end around July or August and after that, he will return to play for the club,&rdquo; he said. Bikokwa joined the military side in January this year from Nzoia United, but injuries kept him from making a big impact in his debut season. Those who know him well, however, remember his sterling performance for Nzoia in the 2015 season where, he scored numerous goals and became the stand out player in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League. Bikokwa&rsquo;s absence will be a significant blow to the GOtv Shield runners up as they are primed to return to continental duty next year in the CAF Confederation Cup.
