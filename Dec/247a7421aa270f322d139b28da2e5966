Mr N is giving me a hard time about getting caught in the act with The Prude at the Polo Club parking lot. He&rsquo;s one to talk! On our first date he was getting hot and heavy with me in the parking lot of a restaurant when the watchman tapped on the window. I pulled my skirt down and tried to button up my blouse. It was ripped so it was a futile attempt. Mr N, ever so confident, opened the window. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he asked curtly, his irritation obvious. &ldquo;&lsquo;Is everything okay, Sir?&rdquo; asked the watchman as he glanced towards my ripped top. &ldquo;Everything is fine,&rdquo; Mr N responded as he started the engine. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, Samantha?&rdquo; he looked towards me. I smiled at the watchman. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;We left and stopped in the middle of the highway to continue what must count as one of my best sexual experiences to date. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compare those two scenarios,&rdquo; Mr N says. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get caught!&rdquo;&ldquo;But we could have,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;It would&rsquo;ve been worth it,&rdquo; he responds with a grin. &ldquo;Remember how your huge panties fell out of your bag?&rdquo; How could I forget? I had removed them in the restaurant in case things went further because they were not very attractive. Terrible looking granny panties, they were. I put them in my bag and forgot about them until they fell out when I was looking for my phone. They landed right on Mr N&rsquo;s hand that was perched on the armrest! He couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing at me!&ldquo;These are huge,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;Do you always carry underwear in your bag?&rdquo; I was so embarrassed. I tried to grab them from him but he was too quick for me. He lifted them to his nose and took a whiff. I was mortified. By now, he was not laughing. He pulled over and parked on the side on the road and left the hazards on. He pulled his seat back and grabbed me like a weightless rag. Next thing I know, I was straddling him. My phone was ringing. I could see the screen. It was Frank. It made it all the more exciting that he was calling me when I was with someone else. Yeah, I had started cheating on him ages ago. The video he saw the other day on the Internet was just the tip of the iceberg.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about that night, please! I&rsquo;m scarred for life,&rdquo; I now say with a smile. I reach into the bag GG gave me. &ldquo;I hope no undergarments are going to fall out of there!&rdquo; Mr N says. &ldquo;Very funny. This is your cash. Do you have a bag?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;In the car,&rdquo; Mr N responds. There is an emphasis on the word &lsquo;car&rsquo;. I hope he&rsquo;s not getting any ideas! I leave the bundle in the bag and change the subject.&ldquo;I need to change the piping in my mother&rsquo;s house. Any idea who can do this for her?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;I just changed my plumbing the other day.&rdquo;He whips out his cell phone and calls someone. They chat in vernacular for a bit and then he hands the phone over to me. We talk and agree to meet in an hour&rsquo;s time. As I hang up the phone, Frank walks back into the bar. This is getting ridiculous. I thought he had left! He sees Mr N and the shock on his face is almost comical. This is the third guy he&rsquo;s seen me with today. This time he doesn&rsquo;t say anything and just walks past. Unperturbed, I have another sip of champagne. I must say, my actions today (and these past few months) give a whole new meaning to the words: &ldquo;Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!&rdquo;
