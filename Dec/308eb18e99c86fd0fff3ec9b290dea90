The Jubilee Party will not win any seat at the Coast next year as all the six counties are opposition strongholds, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said.Any leader who has decamped to Jubilee will also fail miserably next year, he said.Joho is leading an onslaught against the President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto's administration by discrediting its projects.He called the Jubilee administration corrupt and said he will never apologise for calling Ruto a &ldquo;thief&rdquo;. Some Rift Valley elders had asked him to apologise for his remarks.In January this year, more than 11,000 squatters of the controversial Waitiki Farm in Likoni were forced to pay Sh1.2 billion for the land after resettlement.On Sunday Joho said, &ldquo;In Central, the miraa farmers and the coffee farmers were given Sh1 billion and Sh2.4 billion, respectively, but in Mombasa we are asked to pay for our own land.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are not going to pay anything. We shall not go anywhere even if they come to evict us.&rdquo;Jubilee is favouring regions where they have the most backing and are sidelining regions that voted for Cord leader Raila Odinga, the governor said.&ldquo;When they go to Central and Rift Valley region, they call it a development tour. However, when they come to the Coast, it is termed, a meet-the-people tour,&rdquo; Joho said.This is despite the fact that Jubilee has initiated numerous road projects in Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu counties. The projects are currently ongoing.The state has also renovated several markets and commissioned the second container terminal at the Port of Mombasa.Joho spoke during a political rally at Bomani Grounds, Likoni, where he urged Mombasa residents to register to vote out Jubilee.In the March 4, 2013 general election, Jubilee won only a handful seats at the Coast, among them Kinango and Taveta MP posts and Lamu senator.But the party has over the last three years made inroads in the region and has lured many ODM leaders to their side.Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro are among ODM leaders who have pledged their loyalty to Uhuru.Joho and his brigade have accused them of being &ldquo;sell-outs.&rdquo;Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said, &ldquo;I challenge those who have become sell-outs to look closely at what Jubilee has to offer.&rdquo;Three weeks ago, Ruto called Joho an academic dwarf for opposing the Jubilee projects, among them the establishment of a dry port in Naivasha.Nassir said Joho spoke on behalf of all Mombasa residents and Coast leaders support him in pushing for the people&rsquo;s rights.&ldquo;If Joho is an academic dwarf, then Ruto is just an academic fool who does not understand issues affecting the Coast people. He has failed to argue port matters on an intellectual basis,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We cannot allow the port services to be transferred to Naivasha. If protecting the port matters qualify someone to be called an academic dwarf, then let us stay with our economic dwarf.&rdquo;Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko said Uhuru and Ruto are terrified by Joho&rsquo;s rising political star.&ldquo;They have been fighting him for being outspoken. We need to protect him and vote for ODM in next year&rsquo;s general election,&rdquo; she said.Aisha Jumwa, the Kilifi woman representative, described Joho as the &ldquo;Lion of the Coast&rdquo;.Other leaders who spoke during the rally include Kwale Senator Juma Boy, Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, Kwale assembly speaker Sammy Ruwa and MCAs from Mombasa.They said they will continue opposing the government's plans to establish a dry port in Naivasha.Dori said the entire Coast region is singing the ODM song.&ldquo;We will not allow any person to intimidate us. We do not need your money nor your favour, we want our right to own land in the region,&rdquo; he said.Dori said the Coast residents should protect the Mombasa governor from the preying Jubilee government, which is very uncomfortable with Joho&rsquo;s kind of politics.He said Coast residents should vote entirely for ODM for all elective positions to vote out Jubilee.Juma said Kwale region is still an ODM stronghold despite the governor and woman representative decamping to Jubilee.&ldquo;We are still in ODM and we shall ensure that Raila Odinga becomes President next year,&rdquo; he said.
