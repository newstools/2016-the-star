Majority Leader Aden Duale on Sunday claimed that Cord leader Raila Odinga has planted people at IEBC to help him rig the 2017 poll.He said that Raila was working with one Michael Yard in the plan that he says will see Cord use technology to influence the outcome of the August 8 vote.Duale said that he at one time questioned the role of the foreigner when the latter attended an IEBC meeting some three weeks ago.During a press conference at the Jubilee headquarters in Pangani, the Garissa Township legislator accused Yard of being behind the many errors at the electoral commission."We are aware that this same Michael Yard is the chief of International Foundation System. He was in the country during the 2013 elections and he has come again. He is not a staff of the IEBC and we are asking what is his role?," Duale said.He said: "We have written to the IEBC that we do not want to see this Yard anywhere near its premises or even in any business they conduct,"Duale said they had asked the chair of the Legal Affairs Committee to compel IEBC to provide information of all the resources they have received from donor agencies."We want them to further provide names and particulars of all the people seconded to the agencies," he said."Raila knows that he cannot get the numbers to be the president. He wants to use Yard to be part of his scheme to use technology to rig himself as the president. We demand IEBC to provide this information by Tuesday afternoon," he said.Duale had earlier on said claims by Odinga that the election will be rigged showed that he sensed defeat.He accused the opposition leader for undermining the smooth preparation of elections with allegations that IEBC intends to interfere with the outcome of the scheduled polls."Even before IEBC starts preparations for the elections, Odinga has started talking about rigging of elections. We are asking him to tell us if he wants to run IEBC or run for elections," Duale said at that time.On the other hand, Raila on Saturday warned Jubilee against any plot to rig the general election in favour of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The commission has been a centre of focus since the 2013 poll with various leaders urging that it must assure Kenyans a free, fair and credible election in 2017.Read: Raila condemns violent Jubilee elections, warns IEBC against plot to rig 2017 pollAlso read: Jubilee, IEBC &lsquo;want to use skewed audit to rig polls&rsquo;
