Presidential aspirant Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are is drafting a motion to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta for deaths occasioned by the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike.Mong'are said by failing to save lives through ending the doctors' strike and by withholding a report on the actual number of soldiers killed during the El Adde attack, Uhuru has violated the Constitution. Mong&rsquo;are also listed the non-disclosure by the president of those killed in the Westgate mall and the deadly Garissa university terror attacks by the al Shabaab terror group as among the grounds for the impeachment motion.The Nyamira senator said the president should be sent home for gross violation of the Constitution, which is one of the three grounds for the removal of the President from office.Article 145 of the constitution provides that the president can be impeached on grounds of gross violation of the Constitution or any other law, where they are serious reasons for believing that the president has committed a crime under national or international law and for gross misconduct.For an impeachment motion to be moved, the motion must be supported by a third of all members."The president should also be censured for barricading of Parliament by anti-riot police during a Senate debate on the controversial election laws on Wednesday," Mong'are said.He says as the commander-in-chief, Uhuru should account for Kenyan soldiers killed in war with the al Shabaab terror group. The Ford Kenya senator said the president has failed to protect lives he swore to safeguard. Asked whether the issues meet the threshold for the impeachment of the President, Mong&rsquo;are said: "Uhuru will be confronted with the gravity of this matter, when he defends himself before the Senate," "These are acts that border on gross violation of the constitution. Uhuru must be held accountable for leaving Kenyans to die at the mercy of the enemy and then failing to report to the House on facts about the attacks," Mong&rsquo;are said during a press conference at Parliament buildings on Thursday.Mong&rsquo;are, who will run for president next year against Uhuru, downplayed concerns that he lacks the requisite numbers to have the motion passed at the August House."It will be a calling for the senators to rise up to the occasion to defend the constitution. My motion is not about the tyranny of numbers but a challenge to the senators to live up the oath of office," he said."As a patriotic Kenyan, I will offer to educate my colleagues who may not understand the need for the impeachment motion. I will remind them that they have a duty to defend the constitution they swore to protect . It is about objectives and not about tyranny of numbers," he said.Read: Nyamira senator Kennedy Mong'are launches 2017 presidential bid, pledges change
