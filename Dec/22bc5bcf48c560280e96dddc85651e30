I arrived at the main gate at about 1pm to find a huge crowd all trying to be processed for payment for entry into the park due to a silly and unnecessary vintage airshow inside the park . In order to avoid along delay we entered at the east gate .Some of the roads were a bit slippery and muddy due to the rains , so we merely stayed on the main roads and avoided tracks . The transformation from a dry dusty drab place to a wonderland full of new green growth in only10 days has been incredible . God is good ! We drove along very slowly there were many rewards , firstly we saw a Bohor reedbuck , followed by zebra moving with eland , coke s hartebeest , many impala , rock hyrax , and wildebeest . Herds of giraffe walked in the road , as well as large herds of buffalo and a black rhino . The bird sightings were numerous from Ostrich to tiny mating malachite kingfishers . We had two sightings of lions , a lioness ( MF4) and her four sub-adult cubs , and later a special late afternoon moment with two large lions firstly Sam who entertained us before he was joined by Cheru , and then they both serenaded us with a powerful roaring duet composition . My international guests really appreciated there first ever encounter with African wildlife , and afterwards they could not stop talking about how wonderful this park is .As we watched the sunset over the Ngong hills , the tranquil peace over the park was tangible and very real . Indeed the day in the park was a real soul tonic medicine for the inner being , an escape from the fast paced world around us . The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00 .For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on facebook Nairobi national park
