I arrived at the main gate at about 1pm to find a huge crowd all trying to be processed for payment for entry into the park due to a silly and unnecessary vintage airshow inside the park . In order to avoid along delay we entered at the east gate .Some of the roads were a bit slippery and muddy due to the rains , so we merely stayed on the main roads and avoided tracks . The transformation from a dry dusty drab place to a wonderland full of new green growth in only10 days has been incredible . God is good ! We drove along very slowly there were many rewards , firstly we saw a Bohor reedbuck , followed by zebra moving with eland , coke&rsquo;s hartebeest , many impala , rock hyrax , and wildebeest . Herds of giraffe walked in the road , as well as large herds of buffalo and a black rhino . The bird sightings were numerous from Ostrich to tiny mating malachite kingfishers . We had two sightings of lions , a lioness ( MF4) and her four sub-adult cubs , and later a special late afternoon moment with two large lions &hellip;firstly Sam who entertained us before he was joined by Cheru , and then they both serenaded us with a powerful roaring duet composition . My international guests really appreciated there first ever encounter with African wildlife , and afterwards they could not stop talking about how wonderful this park is .As we watched the sunset over the Ngong hills , the tranquil peace over the park was tangible and very real . Indeed the day in the park was a real &ldquo;soul tonic&rdquo; medicine for the inner being , an escape from the fast paced world around us . The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00 .For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on facebook &ndash; Nairobi national park
