The nationwide doctors&rsquo; strike that begun yesterday is yet another signal of failed priorities, management and leadership. It also speaks of bad faith and cruelty at the top in the national and the county governments.There are genuine grievances, but no excuse for the horrors visited upon ailing Kenyans, for instance the woman in Malindi who had a Caesarian section on Sunday but was yesterday discharged and literally made to walk away, still in great pain.The collective bargaining agreement the doctors cite was signed as long ago as 2011 and a court recently ruled the national government must pay up.Among the grievances are delayed pay (sometimes even after the 20th of the subsequent month) and doctors&rsquo; refusing to be posted to the sticks.This strike is the surest sign that Health was devolved without planning. The TSC manages a much bigger workforce&rsquo;s payroll &mdash; that of 320,000 teachers.Perhaps the doctors need something akin to the Teacher&rsquo;s Service Commission to manage hiring, promotions and payroll.
