The privatisation of KPA&rsquo;s operations and setting up of dry ports in Naivasha and other regions would be tantamount to economic sabotage, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has said.On Monday, he said Mombasa&rsquo;s economy will suffer as well as the entire country. Awiti spoke during Jamhuri Day celebrations in Tononoka GroundsHowever, Deputy President William Ruto on Monday denied the state plans to hand over operations of the Kenya Ports Authority&rsquo;s to a private international firm. He told the Dock Workers Union the government has invested heavily in the port and cannot afford to hand over operations.A growing number of local politicians has opposed the establishment of dry ports. While Jubilee leaders say a private firm will help streamline and decongest the port, the opposition disagrees. The opposition to dry ports seems to have united rivals Awiti and Governor Hassan Joho.Other MPs opposed to dry ports include Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Badi Twalib (Jomvu), Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni), Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe) and Senator Hassan Omar.Awiti said at least 10 per cent of KPA&rsquo;s total revenue should be channelled to Mombasa.
