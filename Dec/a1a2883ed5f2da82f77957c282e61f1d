Kisumu MCAs have refused to go on recess for the second time this month, saying the House has pending serious business.They rejected a motion tabled by deputy majority leader James Omolo on Thursday to suspend House business from December 16 to February 7. The MCAs were to have gone on recess on December 2. However, they postponed the motion, insisting they had serious business to attend to. The MCAs may be reluctant to go on a break following reports that a new clerk, Benson Opiyo, seconded by the county executive, might have been secretly sworn in at a hotel on Wednesday. &ldquo;Mr Speaker, we know very well as members of the assembly what is going on and why reports have not been tabled in the House,&rdquo; Awasi MCA Manuel Aim said.Aim was supported by Caroline Owen, who said they have to clear some issues before going on recess and start on a clean slate in February.But North Nyakach MCA Maina Koko on Thursday supported the motion, saying he does not see why the House should not adjourn. &ldquo;The motion has been withdrawn for the last two weeks, and therefore there is no seriousness in what you are saying. We are exposing our ignorance and we will be harshly judged for this,&rdquo; he said.
