Mandera county Health executive Ahmed Sheikh yesterday said his department is prepared to deal with emergencies during the doctors&rsquo; strike.He said outpatient units, maternity wards and laboratories are operating as usual, as their health workers are not unionised.Sheikh said all subcounty hospitals, except in Mandera East, are running well and patients are being attended to by doctors and nurses.He said the county will hire medical staff as needed and do everything to prevent loss of life.Sheikh warned newly employed doctors and nurses against taking part in the strike, as they are not members of the nurses and doctors&rsquo; unions.&ldquo;We will crack the whip against new health workers [who have joined the strike], as they have gone against the code of ethics,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Certain cadres or job groups should not be in any union and we will not sit back and watch as people do whatever they wish.&rdquo;Sheikh blamed the strike on the national government, saying it has failed to implement a 2013 collective bargaining agreement signed by doctors.He said the government is now transferring its problems to the counties, instead of resolving them.Sheikh urged the national Treasury, the Health ministry, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the Labour ministry to expedite implementation of the CBA to save lives.
