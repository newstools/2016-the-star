The IEBC has asked political parties and candidates who will contest in next year&rsquo;s elections to open campaign financing accounts by today.The commission said the Election Campaign Act requires that this is done at least eight months to the day of the general election.In addition to the accounts, political parties and candidates are to establish campaign financing expenditure committees and appoint authorised persons who will manage the campaign funds.&ldquo;All political parties and candidates are required to register with the Commission the details of their campaign financing accounts, including particulars of the authorised persons,&rdquo; the guidelines state. Any person or organisation seeking to contribute to a candidate or political party shall channel such contributions through the independent candidate/political party expenditure accounts.The IEBC said a Political Party Campaign Financing/Expenditure committee should consist of nine members.Three of them are to be nominated by the governing body of the political party and one of the committee members must be the Secretary-General. Other guidelines are that not more than one member shall be from the same region and not more than two-thirds shall be of one gender. &ldquo;Three members shall be signatories to the party financing/expenditure account,&rdquo; the IEBC said.
