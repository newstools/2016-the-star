A 58-year-old grandmother and her five grandchildren died on Saturday night after the house they were sleeping in burnt to ashes. The incident that occurred in Chalani village, Kaloleniu subcounty in Kilifi county happened just minutes after the elderly woman had retired to bed after late night prayers at a church 10 metres from her house. Sidi Mweni&rsquo;s remains were found in one corner of the house holding the five grandchildren. Among the dead were one-and-a-half year old twin sisters Pauline and Nancy. Baraka Kalume aged eight years and her sister Furaha Kalume aged six years also died in the tragedy. The fifth one who also perished in the fire was Ibra Mweni, one-and-four months old.
