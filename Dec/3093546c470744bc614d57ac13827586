A Pokot cattle rustler and member of a ruthless gang of thieves was killed last night while loading cattle onto a lorry at Survey in Laikipia West.This gang has repeatedly struck in the area in the last several weeks, stealing dozens of cattle from communities and ranches.Hundreds of millions of shillings worth of cattle have been stolen in Laikipia this year with very little action by police or government to arrest thieves.Early this month, the US Ambassador Robert Godec and the The British High Commissioner met with Laikipia residents hit by banditry and tribal attacks by pastoralists from Samburu and Baringo.Western diplomats have expressed concerned about events in Laikipia that if the situation fails to improve, there may be the possibility of travel advisories advising caution to international tourists thinking of travel to the county.The disarmament of illegal weapons holders has been stopped despite promises by government.The raiders who are heavily armed are in league with lorry drivers who whisk them off to be slaughtered and sold.Separately, Pokot gunmen attacked police around Kifuku on Tuesday while the GSU and police were trying to restore security in the area.Residents reported hearing grenade explosions and sustained gunfire. Casualties are unknown, but heavily armed Pokot and Samburu invaders in the area are spoiling for a fight with police and gunfire is an almost daily occurrence nowadays.Leaders in Laikipia and Samburu have disagreed over how to handle the invasion by pastrolaists in Laikipia, with some supporting the disarmament of the pastoralists as ordered by the Interior Cabinet secretary Joseph Nkaisser in October, while others think the move will be an abuse of the pastoralists' human rights.
