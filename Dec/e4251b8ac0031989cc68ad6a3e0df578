The films regulator has launched investigations into allegations that several villas in Mtwapa, Watamu and Malindi in Kilifi county are engaging young girls in sex orgies.Ezekiel Mutua, Kenya film classification board chief executive, said they have information of underage girls being used to shoot pornographic movies in most of the private villas.Speaking when he paid a courtesy call on Joseph Keter - Kilifi county commissioner, Mutua pointed out that they also have word of the said girls being forced to sleep with dogs.Last week, the board in collaboration with office of the Kilifi county commissioner, started an awareness program to ensure that the African culture and national values are preserved."Some time back, the board raided villas in Malindi and was able to parade some of the young girls who had been lured to pornographic activities," the regulator said.Mutua said Kilifi is facing moral challenges due to the tourism industry, pointing fingers at NGOs that promote the LGBT culture."Unless we address the issue of our moral values, we are losing the nation. These immoral organisations should not be given licenses to hold public meetings until we establish their motive and mission in the community," Mutua said.Keter said they will work closely with the the films board to weed out the immoral practices reported in Mtwapa, Malindi and Watamu."We are investigating cases of stripper dances in some resorts in Mtwapa town and also others where underage girls are exposed to pornographic films," the commissioner said.Read: Mombasa strip clubs use underage girls to attract clients, says KFCB chairmanAlso read: Bestiality dens, strip clubs in Mombasa to be raided &ndash; Ezekiel Mutua
