Residents of Karai in Naivasha, where a fireball killed 42 people on Saturday, have said they will not permit the removal of speed bumps.They differed with President Uhuru Kenyatta and the motorists association that said the accident on Nairobi-Nakuru highway had to do with the bumps.Uhuru said on Monday that the Kenya National Highways Authority erected the bumps without consultation.But the residents said they have helped reduce, not increase, the number of accidents in the area.Groups that gathered at Raini, Karai and Kinungi said the crash that occurred before a tanker exploded resulted from human error.Their leader James Kabono said only two people had died since the bumps were erected last year.&ldquo;The lorry that caused the accident lost control long before it hit the speed bumps. Calls to remove them are far-fetched,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The solution lies in erecting speed signs on the highway, not removing bumps."Read: At least 40 dead in grisly road accident on Nairobi-Nakuru highwayAlso read: Naivasha tragedy: Death toll hits 42 as two more succumb to injuriesThe Motorists Association of Kenya blamed the tragedy on the irregular erection of a bump on the road at Karai.In a statement on Sunday, the association said the bump was unnecessary and that "it was just a matter of time before they reaped what they intended by erecting the bump"."Many questions have been asked and blame apportioned. But it was not an accident because God did not erect the sign-less and crudely constructed unmarked killer bump in the middle of a busy international highway," said chairman Peter Murima.A senior KENHA official, who declined to be named, said that high-Powered talks were going on following the Presidential directive on the bumps.But he defended the authority saying the signs they erected were vandalised.
