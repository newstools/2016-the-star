Human bones, skulls and coffins have been exposed at filled-up Lang&rsquo;ata Cemetery when a private developer desecrated it and dug trenches for sewage.The developer has put up houses at the adjacent Royal Park Estate and wanted to discharge sewage into the open trenches. They were dug at the weekend. The developer&rsquo;s identity was not immediately disclosed but reporters were trying to unearth his name and company. Health executive Bernard Muia on Wednesday called the trenches a health hazard and said digging them &lsquo;disrespects resting souls&rsquo;. &ldquo;How can a private developer purchase land and build houses where souls are resting. This is against our culture and we will not allow it,&rdquo; he said.MCA Alex Otieno and officials from the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company accompanied Muia for the site visit. Muia ordered the developer to refill the trenches within 24 hours. By yesterday, the developer had refilled some of the trenches. Muia said he will take the estate&rsquo;s welfare association to court if all the trenches are not refilled.&ldquo;I will not sit at City Hall while cemetery land is grabbed,&rdquo; he said. Otieno said the area where the trenches were dug is in the third layer, meaning bodies were buried just about five years ago.&ldquo;Bodies are buried in layers here. The first layer is the deepest one and that has been there for many years. The bodies have decomposed here. Then there is the second layer and the third layer,&rdquo; he said. The recommended grave depth is six feet, but an attendant at the cemetery told the Star they are digging up to three feet deep to accommodate extra bodies. Elijah Choti, an NWSC official in charge of the sewerage department, said the developer did not seek the company&rsquo;s approval to dig trenches.
