Some Bondo residents want Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti to apologise for saying the parliamentary seat there is a preserve of the Odinga family.Led by former ODM vice chairperson Bondo branch George Owino, they said the governor&rsquo;s remarks were reckless and portrayed the Odingas in bad light. Owino said the seat has attracted many candidates outside the Odinga family since independence.He was addressing the press at Usigu trading centre on Wednesday. Owino dismissed calls to endorse Nominated MP Oburu Oginga for the seat, against the wishes of incumbent Gideon Ochanda. On Sunday during a funds drive at the Bondo Catholic Church, Awiti rallied his Siaya counterpart Cornel Rasanga, Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango and MP Fred Outa (Nyando) to endorse Oburu.He said Ochanda won the seat because he was like a &ldquo;farmhand&rdquo; to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Awiti said time has come for him to relinquish the position to the &ldquo;family owners&rdquo;. He said even if Oburu retires from active politics, his son Elijah will take the mantle from him. Awiti urged Ochanda, who was present, to eat a humble pie and wait to be appointed minister if Cord co-principal Raila Odinga becomes President.
