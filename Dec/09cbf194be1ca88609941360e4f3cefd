Pan-African Paper Mills in Webuye, Bungoma county, on Friday switched on its boilers for the first time in more than eight years, marking a return to operations. This follows a take-over by Rai Group&rsquo;s subsidiary, Tarlochan Limited, in a deal announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta in April at State House. The strategic investor pledged to inject up to Sh6 billion fresh capital in five years into the paper maker. The cash will be spent on rehabilitating machines, upgrading the infrastructure and ensuring that the plant operates at full capacity. Industry and Trade CS Adan Mohamed on Friday inspected progress at the factory after Uhuru set December 15 as official opening date.
