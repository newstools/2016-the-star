Education CS Fred Matiang i yesterday said county commissioners should chair the County Education Boards since Education is a national function.He said the support the ministry received from the county commissioners has made a big difference in the coordination of this year s national exams.Matiang i spoke in Machakos after he visited several schools on the last day of KCSE. County commissioners are the coordinators of the national government functionsin counties and it will be easy for us as a ministry to work with them.The management of this year s exams is a good example of what the commissioners can do to restore sanity in schools, he said.The CS said the constitutional amendments that saw the county commissioners deprived of the mandate to chair education boards was a big mistake.He said since the county commissioners stopped chairing these boards, education in schools has been infiltrated by politicians. Matiang i said this has also led to some boards charging parents illegal levies.He said the success in the coordination of the exams has been as a result of a well-formed inter-agency team from the Education, ICT and Interior ministries. Matiang i said the ministry is committed to restoring the integrity of exams.
