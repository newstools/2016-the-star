Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i yesterday said county commissioners should chair the County Education Boards since Education is a national function.He said the support the ministry received from the county commissioners has made a big difference in the coordination of this year&rsquo;s national exams.Matiang&rsquo;i spoke in Machakos after he visited several schools on the last day of KCSE. &ldquo;County commissioners are the coordinators of the national government functionsin counties and it will be easy for us as a ministry to work with them.The management of this year&rsquo;s exams is a good example of what the commissioners can do to restore sanity in schools,&rdquo; he said.The CS said the constitutional amendments that saw the county commissioners deprived of the mandate to chair education boards was a big mistake.He said since the county commissioners stopped chairing these boards, education in schools has been infiltrated by politicians. Matiang&rsquo;i said this has also led to some boards charging parents illegal levies.He said the success in the coordination of the exams has been as a result of a well-formed inter-agency team from the Education, ICT and Interior ministries. Matiang&rsquo;i said the ministry is committed to restoring the integrity of exams.
