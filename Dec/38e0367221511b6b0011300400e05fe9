Garissa Deputy Governor Abdullahi Hussein has dismissed negotiated democracy by county politicians, terming it an insult to the electorate.He said a declaration made two weeks ago in a Nairobi hotel was selfish of some senior politicians keen on protecting their interests at the expense of the community.Abdullahi said those who rubber-stamped the agreement are mere sycophants and do not have the community&rsquo;s backing. He said he will mobilise residents to reject the list. He urged them not to be manipulated by power-hungry politicians.Addresssing a rally at Bulla Mzuri Primary School, political activist Mohammed Sala said as the Abdallah clan, they will ensure their proposals on sharing of seats are adhered to. He said they will hold rallies across the county to discredit those opposed to them. Major (Rtd) Aden Sugow, who is running for senator and Capt Abdi Yare, who is vying for Garissa Township MP, urged residents to be wary of politicians using clans to advance their political ambitions. Sugow said his sub-clan already has a candidate for senator and woman representative. He questioned why some elders met in Nairobi to settle on a contrary agreement.
