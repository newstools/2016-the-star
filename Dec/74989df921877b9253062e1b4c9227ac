They ferried drank goons who were dressed in party colors and harassed ordinary women. I am astonished that people who belong to the ruling party can bring violence to a meeting that is celebrating a national day. That is a shame&rdquo;, said Munya.The chaos saw anti riot police use tear gas canisters to disperse rowdy crowds immediately after the County Commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga had finished reading the president&rsquo;s speech. At least two people were injured in the melee.Related story: Cop beaten as Joho, Awiti supporters clash during Jamhuri Day feteOn his part, Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi however accused Munya of bringing goons into the venue of the meeting.&ldquo;We did not get the right opportunity to discuss our milestones and failures as Meru people in the spirit of Jamhuri because the lord and prince of corruption, poverty and evils decided to come and have his hooligans descend on us in the field. Let him grow up and understand that he has a higher calling and should act in a manner that brings dignity to the office of the governor&rdquo;, said Linturi.Central Imenti MP Mwiti said as Jubilee affiliated leaders, they dispel chaos and called on Munya to exercise sober politics.&ldquo;His antics will not be counted on the ballot. He has not achieved any development so far. We are praying for Munya to live longer so that we can show him how the leadership of a governor should work,&rdquo; said Mwiti.Meru governor aspirant Kilemi Mwiria said the Jubilee leaders comprised of Senator Kiraitu Murungi, Women Rep Florence Kajuju and Mithika Linturi (MP, Igembe South) fanned the violence and tainted the party&rsquo;s image.&ldquo;This group of leaders is not Jubilee Party but &lsquo;KiKaLi&rsquo; (referring to Kiraitu, Kajuju and Linturi), which is tainting the party image. Today was not a political affair but a national event,&rdquo; Mwiria said.
