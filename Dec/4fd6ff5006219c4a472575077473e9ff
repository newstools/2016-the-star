More than 1,000 youths have been mobilised to guard the Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega county, where the Luhya community political leader will be unveiled on Saturday. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli will lead the event and hundreds of residents are expected to attend. Yesterday, he said the event is aimed at uniting the community. &ldquo;My role is to consolidate the Luhya community&rsquo;s vote into one basket. This is a large community whose voters are united, but the leaders are divided. It&rsquo;s time I resolve that division so that we can achieve our goal,&rdquo; Atwoli told the Star in his Khwisero home. He said he is not interested in politics, but the unity of his people &ldquo;where my umbilical cord was buried&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not vying for any position in the Kenyan mainstream politics. I&rsquo;m comfortable as an international trade unionist. Let no one associate me with any political party or politician,&rdquo; Atwoli said. Among the Luhya VIPs being considered for the position of community leader are ANC&rsquo;s Musalia Mudavadi, Ford&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and former Parliament Speaker Kenneth Marende A section of Ford Kenya leaders have broken ranks with Wetang&rsquo;ula, who is opposed to the rally. They have said they will attend. &ldquo;We are fully in support of the initiative by Atwoli, because it has the backing on the entire Luhya community that has been yearning to have a political direction under one leader,&rdquo; Trans Nzoia Senate aspirant Ken Wafula said. Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale have opposed the event, arguing that Atwoli has no mandate to name the community spokesman. &ldquo;We want him to tell us who gave him that mandate. But if he wants to appoint a personal spokesman that is fine,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said. However, Atwoli has asked the leaders opposed to the event to keep off and watch proceedings from home. Wafula, who is in the organising team, said the venue would be tightly guarded and any attempts to disrupt it would be resisted. &ldquo;As usual Wetang&rsquo;ula has not consulted and wants to impose his personal feelings on members. We will not accept that and we stand with the community,&rdquo; he said. Butula MP Michael Onyura said Atwoli&rsquo;s plan may eventually help the Western communities to achieve the political unity that has for long been elusive. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good move and if it works well, we will all rally behind the leader who will be named through the process that has been going on,&rdquo; he said. Onyura said if the community unites and speaks in one voice it will be taken seriously in the country&rsquo;s political arena.
