Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o is old and should drop his bid for governor, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said on Sunday.Instead, he urged Nyong&rsquo;o to focus on Senate duties. &ldquo;We work till midnight and with Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s age, will he really manage the kind of job we do?&rdquo; Oparanya said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the deputy party leader and he should listen.&rdquo;The county boss drummed up support for Governor Jack Ranguma. He said Ranguma deserves a second term. &ldquo;He is my friend and he has achieved a lot,&rdquo; Oparanya said. He made the comments in Kisumu West at the burial of Environment City director Thomas Sweta.Oparanya urged Kisumu residents to reelect Ranguma so he can implement the projects he has started. The governors, he said, need two terms to ensure stability and success of devolution.&ldquo;Since the inception of devolution, we spent three and a half years putting structures in place. It is, therefore, necessary that we be reelected to fully deliver service to our people,&rdquo; Oparanya said.He said they have made significant gains, despite numerous problems faced by counties, adding that most of them are orchestrated by the national government and enemies of devolution.The deputy ODM boss told off senators who want to unseat governors, accusing them of being self-centered and selfish.&ldquo;At least senators found structures in place because we attained independence in 1963. But with devolution, we needed time to have structures,&rdquo; Oparanya said.&ldquo;The senators didn&rsquo;t know what governorship entails. They thought governors are county council chairmen. I don&rsquo;t understand how they read the Constitution. They read it upside down. They are now all over aspiring to be governors.&rdquo;
