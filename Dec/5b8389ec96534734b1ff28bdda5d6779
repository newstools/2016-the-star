Men in Busia have been urged to get circumcised to stop the spread of HIV-Aids, especially in Budalang&rsquo;i, where the rate of new infections remains high.&ldquo;This is not a vasectomy as it is rumoured. We will just remove the foreskin to reduce the chances of contacting the virus,&rdquo; Health executive Maurice Simiyu said.A four-year Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Programme that ended in September established that men aged 25 and above are the most reluctant to get circumcised, yet they are the most active sexually.The initiative was spearheaded by the National Aids and STI Control Programme and the Busia government.Speaking during a seminar for 30 health workers, Siminyu said Busia is among the counties with a high rate of new HIV infections.He urged health partners and the county to increase efforts and use available means to fight the scourge. Siminyu said those who are uncircumcised are most likely to contract HIV. &ldquo;We want our community health volunteers to get involved so that we can mobilise as many men as possible to be circumcised. We hope this way, some impact will be realised.&rdquo;
