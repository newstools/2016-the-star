Stop dreaming about reelection, Bondo MP seat is a preserve of the late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga&rsquo;s family, four ODM leaders told MP Gideon Ochanda (pictured) on Sunday. Governors Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay) and Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango (Siaya) and MP Fred Outa (Nyando) told Ochanda to his face to support nominated MP Oburu Oginga.
