He takes over from Zedekiah Zico, Otieno who was sent on compulsory leave alongside his assistant George Maina early this month.Zico, who is also former Kenyan international and Gor Mahia coach though will remain with the mailmen, as the technical director. Posta chairman John Tonui while confirming the development, said the restructuring was meant help achieve the club s set goals in 2017. Pamzo has a wealth of experience, which will see us move to the next level after finishing fourth in the Sportpesa Premier League this year, said Tonui.Despite Tonui not disclosing their targets, an insider at the club confirmed they hope to win at least one title next year and finish at a better position in the league. Rangers rejoined the league in 2015 after missing the chance to play in the top tier following confusion, that saw relegated Nakuru All Stars and City Stars remain in the league, due to the war between FKF and KPL over the number of teams to take part in the league.Tonui also confirmed that Pascal Ochieng and Lawrence Webo who were in charge of the team in the last two KPL matches, will retain their positions as team manager and keepers trainer respectively. Pamzo, who won the KPL title with Tusker in 2011, also had stints with Mahakama, Oserian, Sony Sugar and Indian side East Bengal, and was the head coach at Zetech University until his appointment.Pamzo will be given the free hand to chose his assistant ahead of the busy 2017 season which will see Rangers play in the KPL top 8 Cup for the first time.Elsewhere, Jeconiah Uyoga is the 2016 Sportpesa Super 8 League Most Valuable Player after being unveiled in a colourful Sportpesa Super 8 gala awards at a Nairobi Hotel over the weekend.The TUK FC forward was the toast of the night as he became the first player to bag the award in two straight years in the history of the competition.He won it last year during the 9th edition and beat Jericho All Stars Victor Walera and Kayole Asubuhi captain Joel Mutua to the accolade again this year.On top of the trophy, Jeconiah also received Sh30,000 in prize money from title sponsors and he could not hold back his joy.
