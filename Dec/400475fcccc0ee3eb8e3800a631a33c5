Tourism CS Najib Balala has urged Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to undertake projects that can improve the economy.Balala was fronted by the Jubilee Party to challenge Joho in next year&rsquo;s election, but he refused. He said the &ldquo;kiosk-economy mentality&rdquo; should not be tolerated in Mombasa. On Friday, Balala said he supports Joho&rsquo;s Sh2 billion housing project and phasing out of tuk-tuks from the Mombasa CBD.Businessman Suleiman Shahbal and lawyer Ananiah Mwaboza will battle it out for the JP ticket to run for the Mombasa governor seat. The two have been at the forefront in discrediting Joho&rsquo;s projects. Shahbal opposes the housing project. Speaking at the launch of the Sh350 million Cruise Ship Terminal construction at Mombasa port, Balala said he envies some of Joho&rsquo;s projects. He was seen to be endorsing Joho&rsquo;s projects. Balala said politics should not derail the Mombasa development agenda.&ldquo;Bwana governor, stop this petty politics and we will support you,&rdquo; he said.
