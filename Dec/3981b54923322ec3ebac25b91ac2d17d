The owners of a seven-acre property at the centre of a land grab investigation have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko accusing him of failing to prosecute the fraudsters laying claim to the Sh2.4billion parcel.Nairobi House Ltd through lawyer Philip Nyachoti says the DPP has failed to prosecute the suspects for the past nine years when the land grabbers who had forged land ownership papers were unearthed.Nyachoti also says in the letter that the police have attempted to get court orders to compel his clients to surrender the title as part of a forensic investigation."Our client is of the view that this is an intentional and deliberate diversionary tactic aimed at stalling the case before court and interfering with the status of the title which is currently in safe custody of the bank where it was used to secure a loan," the lawyer says.
