A man who survived the Naivasha tanker tragedy but lost his wife and sister is appealing for help to settle a Sh204,400 bill at the Nairobi hospital where the wife died while undergoing treatment.Daniel Kamau's wife was rushed to the hospital at 1am on Sunday night after the tragedy but succumbed to her injuries at 5am the same night leaving behind the huge bill. Kamau said he intended to transfer his wife's body to Kenyatta University Funeral Home but was required to deposit Sh50,000 first before being allowed to collect the body.The hospital's management however allegedly reneged on the agreement after he paid the deposit."I arrived in the morning and the cashiers told me that I must pay the deposit after which they would talk to their boss who would determine whether I will get the body. The boss said a committee must sit and agree and I was told I must clear the entire bill," Kamau said at the Chiromo Mortuary."I came here yesterday (Sunday) to talk to government officials to help me collect the body to stop the bill from accruing but no help came my way."Kamau at some point broke down during the interview with media as he explained how he attempted to save his mother who is admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. His sister is still missing after the incident."I saw a ball of fire and started helping my mother unfasten her safety belt. But it happened so fast and the car exploded throwing me out leaving them inside," Kamau said before breaking into tears. He escaped unhurt."The car was burned completely and our sister is missing since then," he saidHe said he pulled his mother and wife out but the fire engulfed his car with his sister still trapped inside.Kamau, who was the one driving, was traveling from a family function in Ol Kalau back to Nairobi together with his mother, wife and sister on the fateful night.
