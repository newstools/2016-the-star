More than 14,000 drought-stricken Ganze constituency in Kilifi county on Friday began drinking electronic water, a project introduced by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The project enables residents to use automated electronic cards filled with tokes to buy water.Funded by the International Committee of the Red Cross, it was launched at Mbudzi-Mayowe-Chivara (Mbumachi) areas in Jaribuni, Ganze subcounty.It is expected to help solve the perennial water problems in the area, which is known as one of the worst-hit by drought and famine in the country.How it works The system is similar to the use of an automated teller machine to withdraw cash. One has to buy tokens from vendors and fill in their cards to buy water of up to 20 litres. Then one places the e-card at the point of filling, which has a censor.Water starts flowing automatically until it reaches the amount set. If one goes with a five-litre or 10-litre container, the system stops immediately the container is full.In the normal supply system, people waste a lot of water cleaning their containers or filling them until they overflow. In the new system, they cannot waste any water as everything is set to fit the 20-litre jerricane.On Friday, the KRCS and ICRCS officially handed over the project to the Kilifi government. Governor Amason Kingi presided over the ceremony, which was also attended by senior county officials, area MP Peter Shehe and several MCAs. Also present were KRCS secretary general Abbas Gullet, Coast regional manager Hassan Musa and representatives of donors.Gullet said the project is the first one the KRCS has carried out in the area and was piloted in Kilifi and Tana River counties. KRCS experts said the electronic water system is cost-effective and reduces loss of non-revenue water, as the taps stops refilling immediately the 20-litre limit is reached.No kiosks necessaryKRCS project manager Hakima Masoud told journalists they have set up five water points. Traditionally these would be water kiosks, which normally cost about Sh400,000 per unit, where the vendor is supposed to construct a building and pay a bill to the water company monthly.Unlike those kiosks, which sometimes are closed if the vendor fails to pay bills, the new system does not require kiosks. It has a system fitted with a prepaid system and a prepaid metre.Masoud said the new system will help to solve problems of non-revenue water loss and shortages caused by the vendor failing to pay bills.&ldquo;Every person shall have the authority to use water. One does also not need specific knowledge to use the card, just top up the tokens and buy water at the point of operation,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.Already the Red Cross has established vendors who are selling tokens and teaching residents on how to use the cards.Solar powerAt the centre, the prepaid system uses solar power to ensure they are powered throughout to avoid inconveniencies caused by electricity blackouts.Moreover, the KRCS installed solar panels at the pumping station to alternate electricity, particularly during blackouts, to ensure a smooth flow of water throughout.Gullet urged the county and the national government officials, particularly the governor and the MP, to push for and add funds to help the Red Cross expand the project.He said the KRCS has already set up five water points and plans to add 10 others to reach more people who have difficulties in getting water.Gullet welcomed the presence of national and county officials, who are normally rivals. &ldquo;Today, my happiness is to see all leaders together, especially the MP and the governor, on matters of development not politics. Residents need to be served,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Gullet urged politicians to put aside their political interests for the benefit of the people.On the electronic water project, the secretary general said it was the first time they were utilising water technology in the villages and they intend to take it to other parts of the country.He said the move aims to reduce the hurdles experienced by residents who struggle to get relief during famine and struggle to get water.Gullet said last month, they started the cash-transfer programme in Ganze, targeting 6,000 people who will get Sh6000 monthly.He said they also intend to come up with another major water project in Bamba, which will assist more than 80,000 people.Funding the water Kingi said the electronic water project is important to residents and promised to push for funds from his government to implement the project.&ldquo;In the big towns, people go to ATMs with the aim of withdrawing cash, but here, they will use the ATMs to withdraw water,&rdquo; he said.The governor said the county will sit with KRCS officials to look for funds quickly to do the e-water project.&ldquo;In the last three years, there has been a marked transformation in terms of access to clean and portable water in Kilifi county. We have made deliberate efforts to inject funds to help develop Kilifi better,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In this financial year, we have set aside more than Sh600 million for key water projects to solve the perennial water problem in Ganze and Magarini.&rdquo;Devolved services Kingi urged the national government to &ldquo;stop hanging onto devolved functions&rdquo;, saying it derailed development in counties. He said the Jubilee government has been implementing laws that are directed to take away powers from county governments so it can keep controlling billions of shillings.&ldquo;Functions such as water, roads and health are devolved, and it is the duty of the county government to oversee these services. But still, the national government wants to control these services. What we need is to work together to see that we serve our people and improve their lives,&rdquo; he said.Shehe said leaders and residents should take care of the project.The project will now be managed by the Kilifi Water and Sewerage Company, which is under the county government.
