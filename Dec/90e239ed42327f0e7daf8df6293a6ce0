Suba MP John Mbadi has said members of the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee are being compromised by the government to frustrate the probe into the NYS scandal.Mbadi, himself a member of the committee, said agents from the office of the President had approached members to advise them against investigations into the Sh1.6 billion scam.He said Jubilee members had been directed to ensure Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Deputy President William Ruto s aide Farouk Kibet do not appear before the committee for questioning. The committee may not get to the bottom of this matter. Those seeking (to frustrate the probe) are from the presidency, but it may not be the President himself, Mbadi (pictured) said.He spoke on NTV on Tuesday night and said the amount of money lost in the scam was colossal, suggesting the country may have lost more than Sh10 billion. The legislator said the committee could not summon Suna East MP Junet Mohamed over reports in the media that he was involved in the theft at the National Youth Service. Two companies linked to Junet pocketed Sh129 million from the dubious supply of goods.According to the Registrar of Companies, Junet holds 50 shares in Zeigham Enterprises with his postal address number shown as 135, Suna, Migori. Zeigham, which was registered in July 2012, was paid Sh10,230,000 for the supply of machine belts, Sh6,660,000 for submersible pumps and Sh5,500,000 for the supply of centrifugal clutches.
