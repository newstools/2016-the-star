A former Budalang&rsquo;i MP has said residents are reaping the fruits of bad leadership after electing wrong leaders into office.Former MP Raphael Wanjala on Tuesday urged residents to pick leaders who can deliver, not those only interested in enriching themselves with public money. He spoke in Ruambwa trading centre.The former legislator is seeking to unseat MP Ababu Namwamba. &ldquo;You voted me out in 2007, and elected those whom you thought would do better than me, you are now complaining that you have been neglected,&rdquo; Wanjala said.He accused Budalang&rsquo;i leaders of abandoning the projects he had initiated while he was the MP.Wanjala said during his two-term tenure, no money was lost and every cent was properly accounted for.He said Ruambwa residents have a lot of problems, including water shortages, especially in Namalo.&ldquo;The CDF committee had allocated funds between 2008-2010 to implement water project called the Greater Bunyala Water Project. The project has stalled yet a lot of taxpayers&rsquo; money had been spent on it,&rdquo; Wanjala said.The former legislator, who is a director at Nzoia Sugar Company, said more than 200 children from Ruambwa and Mudembi go to secondary schools in Siaya county. &ldquo;It is surprising to note that Ruambwa and Mudembi sublocations have only one day secondary school &ndash; Nayera Model Academy &ndash; which is understaffed and cannot accommodate many students,&rdquo; Wanjala said. He also defended Cord chief Raila Odinga against accusations by some politicians in Budalang&rsquo;i that he has not initiated any development in Bunyala.
