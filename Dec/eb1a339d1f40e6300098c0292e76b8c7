Commercial banks are now demanding for collateral for new borrowers in the wake of increased risk following the enforcement of the rate caps in September, a top industry official said yesterday.First Community Bank chief executive Fazal Said told the Star in an interview yesterday that many micro-sized enterprises and households with no security are being locked out. Some of the banks have resorted to layoffs.He said First Community Bank has laid off 90 employees last month.The Banking Amendment Act was enforced on September 14, forcing banks to pursue a technology-driven strategy to lower costs.The law capped interest rates granted on deposits to at least 70 per cent of the base rate set by the CBK. Currently, this translates to a seven per cent minimum interest rate since the CBK's Monetary Policy Committee retained the Central Bank Rate at 10 per cent in its meeting on November 28.Said said the law is likely to reduce the ability of banks to differentiate creditworthiness and price accordingly, leading to a more homogeneous product, reduced competition and shutting out of certain categories of borrowers.&ldquo;The net effect is that the people who were due to benefit from this law will not benefit because people at the lower end have no collateral,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Many small banks need to work more on non-funded income streams like treasury bills and invest more in digitalisation so that they have lean and sustainable teams,&rdquo; said Said.Fazal, a former manager at World Bank Group's International Finance Corporation, senior employee who has also worked for several South african banks, said many banks are cutting their staff numbers because they are not making enough money to sustain themselves return devidents to their shareholders.He said so far First Community Bank has not been forced to take a bailout from Central Bank because it has had enough money to meet its obligations.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that we are in a good space. We have never gone to CBK for money because the bank&rsquo;s liquidity was sufficient to take it through the period when the banks were taken for receivership.I&rsquo;m clear that with the base we are setting up now and with the new strategy the board is taking this bank will grow.&rdquo;
