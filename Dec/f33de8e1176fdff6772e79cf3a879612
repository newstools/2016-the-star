Kiambu county nurses have refused to join county doctors and other medics in the nationwide public health workers strike that began yesterday.A 21-day strike notice issued on November 14 expired, prompting the industrial action, which immediately took a heavy toll on patients.Health workers boycotted operations to demand review of job groups, promotions, deployment, transfer and remuneration, according to a Collective Bargaining Agreement.But in a statement to newsrooms, Kiambu nurses said, &ldquo;We held wide consultations with members and the decision is that we are not part of the strike,&rdquo; the statement read.It was issued by Kenya National Union of Nurses Kiambu branch secretary Hillary Kibiriti. He said nursing services will be available as usual. Kibiriti said the branch is well aware of a pending case challenging the leadership of the union, thus barring them from participating in the strike.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re equally aware of the injunctive orders against the strike notice. We reassure your office of our resolve to abide by the court order,&rdquo; the statement read.In 2015, Kiambu doctors and nurses walked off the job, protesting against delay in salary payment. The health workers accused the county government of being insensitive to their plight, saying their salaries had been delayed for a month.However, they resumed to work after signing a CBA with the county.
