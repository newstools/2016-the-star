Musa Ibrahim has been appointed chairman of the Kenya Taekwondo Federation on an interim basis for two months.Other officials picked by a well attended stakeholders meeting at the Nairobi Railway Club include Samuel Kanyoro Maingi (interim secretary) and Zachary Chesoni (acting treasurer). During the meeting attended by representatives from 17 counties, two Kenya Taekwondo Association officials Eliud Mutalii (secretary) and Master Benson Voiya (treasurer) tendered their resignation letters in support of the movement. Their resignation letters were sent to the Kenya National Sports council, copied to the KTF and KTA officials. Counties present included Migori, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Machakos, Homabay, Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kajiado among others.Stakeholders accused the two parallel factions for running down the federation with no structures in place to protect the game. The newly appointed interim chairman (Master Musamusi Ibrahim) lamented that the two factions had no license to operate&mdash;meaning they can be challenged in a court of law.&ldquo;To avoid court cases in the near future, stakeholders had to step in to save the sport from imminent collapse. We need to start the new year on a sound footing and that is why we have come up with a caretaker committee to oversee the operations and leadership of our game,&rdquo; observed Musa.
