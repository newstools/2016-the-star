It was getting late after a hot day. I watched the sun setting fast. I drove along just looking straight ahead. It was difficult to see as the sun was in my eyes. Suddenly, a large, fat object popped up in the middle of the road. I stopped to look at it. Wow, it was a fairly large puff adder, a snake found in the park but not often seen in the road. Puff adders (Bitis arietans) are venomous snakes, found in rocky grasslands over vast areas of Africa. A large specimen can measure up to 190 cm ( 75 in). This species is responsible for more fatalities than any other African snake. The venom has cytotoxic effects, poisoning the blood cells. They normally appear to be sluggish but that is deceptive, as their strike is very fast and aggressive. In fact, their strike speed has actually been measured at less than 0.25 of a second. Puff Adders are mostly nocturnal. They prey on vermin such as rodents. Therefore, they perform an important and vital role in balancing the ecosystem.If ever you are walking in long grass and you hear a loud hiss, then stand very still and try to see where the snake is. If it is more than one metre away then slowly retreat, and walk away. If closer don&rsquo;t move and call for help.It is very unusual for a visitor to have an incident with a Puff Adder in the Nairobi Park, as KWS keeps the grass in picnic areas very short, and snakes do not normally attack humans unless provoked. However, it is always good to take care.The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
