Hotel owners should offer favourable rates to domestic tourists to grow the industry, Tourism Fund CEO Joseph Cherutoi has said.He spoke on Saturday at a stakeholders&rsquo; dinner in Gelian Hotel, Machakos.Local tourists kept the industry afloat when international tourist numbers decline, Cherutoi said.&ldquo;For the last two years when the country was facing the challenge of travel advisories, the hotel industry survived because of domestic tourists,&rdquo; he said.In 2014, Australia, France, the UK and the US issued travel advisories against Kenya, mainly at the Coast and in Northeastern, following several terror attacks in the country.The areas included Eastleigh in Nairobi, Garissa, Lamu and Tana River counties.In June last year, the UK lifted its advisory in Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa counties, while in October the US lifted advisories in Mombasa and Malindi towns.In December 2015, France lifted its advisory in Mombasa and Malindi towns.However, the countries have still advised on only essential travel to some parts of the Coast and Northeastern.Cherutoi said the hotel business would soon pick up and the newly formed Tourism Police Unit would ensure visitors are safe during the Christmas holiday.Gelian Hotel chairman Alfonse Kioko said more Kenyans are investing in the hospitality sector. In the past it was dominated by foreign investors, he said.
