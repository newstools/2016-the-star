Knut has urged its 110 branches countrywide to intensify recruitment of new teachers.Secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) yesterday told the 59th Annual Delegates Conference at Kasarani Stadium that 67,000 teachers &ldquo;had chosen not to become members yet they continue to joyride and benefit freely from packages negotiated by the union.&rdquo;Knut signed a Sh54 billion salary pay rise in October. There are 305,635 teachers employed by the TSC to work in public schools and colleges.The Knut membership stood at 197,555 in August 2015. About 12 per cent (35,000) belong to rival union Kuppet.Knut membership numbers dropped further in October to 180,464 after the TSC launched a three-month union membership validation drive starting December 2015 to end membership poaching and misdirected union dues.
