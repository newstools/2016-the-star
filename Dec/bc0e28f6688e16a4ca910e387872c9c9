ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday said the opposition has no option but to form an alliance to send the Jubilee administration home.He is spearheading the National Super Alliance that targets to unite Cord affiliate parties.They include ODM, led by Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s Wiper and Ford Kenya of Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula against President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party.Mudavadi spoke at the party secretariat after he was nominated for presidency by the party&rsquo;s National Governing Council. &ldquo;Kenya is on its deathbed, bleeding and moaning over the rampant corruption within the Jubilee. It is the time to make painful sacrifices to save Kenya,&rdquo; Mudavadi said, &ldquo;We will betray Kenyans if we dither because it&rsquo;s not about who, but what we can do for the people.&rdquo;Raila, who held a joint meeting with Mudavadi in Laikipia and Tharaka Nithi this week, was expected to attend the endorsement, but instead sent Siaya Senator James Orengo.Mudavadi said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must stop crucial procurements until new commissioners are in office and a multilateral electoral conference convened on the next elections.This comes barely a day after Raila and Kalonzo called for a halt of election material procurements until a new commission is appointed to replace the Issack Hassan-led team.Already, Sh2.5 billion has been committed by the IEBC for the procurement of ballot papers. The opposition said this was irregular. Orengo said some individuals in Jubilee &ldquo;calling themselves hustlers&rdquo; are busy deceiving the people about development, when they are &ldquo;busy milking the country dry&rdquo;.&ldquo;People who call themselves hustlers are not fit to be anywhere near the leadership of this country. A hustler is a social outcast, a misfit who doesn&rsquo;t behave well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That person is called a hoodlum. If such a person can rise to the position of even an MCA, then there is something terribly wrong.&rdquo;He said there will be no election unless the ground is level and challenged the Cord leaders and their supporters to &ldquo;get it right this time&rdquo;.On the ongoing health workers strike, Mudavadi said it is unfortunate to see Kenyans dying for lack of medication, yet the President and Deputy President William Ruto are busy campaigning.
