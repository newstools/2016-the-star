Inflation in November rose 6.68 per cent compared with 6.47 per cent in October, driven by an increase in food prices, rent and transport. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data shows between October and November, food and non-alcoholic drinks index increased by 1.17 per cent. This was driven by an increase in prices of tomatoes, sugar, sukuma wiki and cabbages. The prices of ripe bananas, pineapples and mangoes, however, dropped. Over the same review period, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels index increased by 0.11 per cent. This was partly due to increases in house rents and kerosene which outweighed notable falls in the cost of cooking gas, KNBS director general Collins Omondi said yesterday. The transport index increased by 0.55 per cent in November compared to October 2016 mainly due to price increases in petrol and diesel .The average monthly rent for a single room was recorded at Sh4,070 up from Sh4,032 in October. Monthly rent for maisonette was Sh33,247 up from Sh33,123. The inflation rate has gradually been increasing since September, but remains below 7.7 per cent recorded in January.
