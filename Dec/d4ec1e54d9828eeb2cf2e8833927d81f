With the eagerly awaited Gor Mahia polls approaching, contestants in the election have scoffed at the decision arrived by the newly elected board chaired by PatrickLumumba to reduce the voting delegates from 4,800 to 3,000.Dan Oketch, who will be vying for the chairman post that is currently held by prominent lawyer Ambrose Rachier, termed the decision to reduce the number of voters as unfair and unwarranted. Speaking after holding a two-hour meeting with the new board at the club&rsquo;s secretariat at the Nyayo Stadium, Oketch said the election exercise will not be credible since many genuine voters will be locked out.Contacted for comment, Lumumba said the decision was unanimously agreed by the candidates and dismissed those making wild allegations as insincere since they were sensing defeat. The board supremo said they took the decision after conducting a comprehensive verification that revealed many discrepancies with their original identification cards with some bearing missing names and photos. Nevertheless, William Ojijo, who will be vying for the position of Deputy Secretary General post that is held by Ronald Ngala, said he had no problem with the decision to reduce the number of voters.&ldquo;I am ready for Sunday polls. Personally, I have confidence with the newly appointed board chaired by Lumumba and I&rsquo;m confident I will win. I believe with free, fair and credible elections, I will edge out Ronald Ngala from his seat,&rdquo; Observed Ojijo, who is a Nairobi Lawyer. The club goes for the eagerly awaited polls on Sunday at the Safaricom Kasarani indoor stadium.Full list of contestants&mdash;Chairman: Ambrose Otieno Rachier, Chrispine Omondi, Dan Oketch Ang&rsquo;ila; Senior Vice Chairman: Francis Wasuna; 1st Vice Chairman: John Pesa, Faiz Ochieng; 2nd Vice Chairman: George Oria Ongudi, David Oduol Kilo; Secretary General: Kwenda Samuel Ochola, Ben Omondi Odongo, Joseph Ogidi Oyoo; Deputy Secretary: Ngala Ronald Ng&rsquo;onga, Ruben William Ojijo; Assistant Deputy Secretary General: Kevin Odhiambo Mbuya, John Ochieng Onyango; Treasurer: Kennedy Ouma, Jared Odhiambo Omolo, Sally Bolo, Chito Moses Njeria; Assistant Treasurer: Gerphas Okuku Ogola, Carilus Onyango, Calvince Okeyo Bungu; Organizing Secretary: David Ochieng Nyandega, Judith Anyango; Assistant Organizing Secretary: Sammy Ochieng Ogola, Beryl Peres Anyango.
