Most of us still have a vivid memory of the &ldquo;mass action&rdquo; campaign led by the Cord political opposition group, earlier this year.And many are the images we recall from that time: of huge clouds of teargas on city streets; of policemen bleeding from wounds suffered from stones flung at high speed by slingshots; of innocent Kenyans bleeding to death on the streets &ndash; their only crime having been that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time.Now we are told that &ndash; owing to the political disagreement between the governing Jubilee Party and the opposition Cord, over election management legislation &ndash; we will be heading back to those days, immediately after the New Year.That the opposition proposes to again confront the government on the streets of our major cities, in an effort to compel a retreat on this matter.Whatever may be said about the political strategies that underlie either the government's or the opposition's positions, what is certain is that Kenyans will enter the New Year, not with hope, but with deep unease and a sense of foreboding.This will not be a Merry Christmas at all, given what we now know to lie ahead.
