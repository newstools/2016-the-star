Kisumu MCAs were on Tuesday afternoon locked out of the assembly and told to hold their sittings there.Speaker Ann Adul ordered the city management to close the assembly as the MCAs were on a long recess - from December 2 to February 7.She said in a letter seen by the Star that no sessions would be held."Consequently no purported business of the assembly should be transacted at the municipal chambers," the letter stated. It further informed the office not to allow members to transact any plenary. But clerk Philip Adundo said the assembly had not gone on recess. MCAs resolved that they would not set an adjournment date that had not been agreed upon by all members.They held sessions outside the gate and said Governor Jack Ranguma and Adul should be impeached.Nominated MCA Lydia Odhiambo said Ranguma should avoid issues of assembly since it is autonomous. Odhiambo accused the governor of stooping too low into affairs of the Assembly. She said the executive has continued to interfere with their legislative role and currently has provided the assembly with a new clerk yet they have a sitting clerk. "We also have information that the governor has closed the assembly accounts "she said. The MCAs said once the accounts are closed the assembly will be crippled because they will not be able to conduct their duties effectively. Elijah Omondi said the executive is broke and wants to loot money from the assembly coffers. Omondi accused them of deliberately trying to stop the assembly from performing it's duties and functions. He said they are ready to go to the Senate to raise the concerns. The members later moved to their old assembly chambers, which is currently undergoing renovation, to hold their sessions.Read: Hundreds of contractors storm Kisumu assembly, demand payment
