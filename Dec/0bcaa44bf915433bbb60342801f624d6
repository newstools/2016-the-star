President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday mourned South Africa-based Prof Rok Ajulu as one of Kenya's most distinguished and thoughtful academics.Prof Ajulu, one of the academics who fled the country in the early 1980s at the height of purge on perceived dissidents, died on Monday after long illness.He said that the late don, who hails from Bondo, Siaya county, was a true pan-African who will be missed deeply."The young man quickly distinguished himself by his intelligence and courage. It was that combination of wit and strength that eventually earned him a PhD from the University of Sussex," Uhuru said. Prof Ajulu taught in the United Kingdom, as well as in Kenya, before eventually settling in South Africa."He was a penetrating and prolific scholar; his books and papers expressing his distinctive views in rigorous and stylish prose," the president said in a statement.He said the late don raised a family with Lindiwe Sisulu - who serves as Human Settlements minister in the Republic of South Africa.The statement said that the don's daughter from a previous relationship - Achieng Ajulu-Bushnell - represented Kenya in international swimming."I am grateful for Professor Ajulu's life, rich in achievements, in friendships, and in productive scholarship. I offer his family what consolation I can, and I pray that God will grant them the courage to bear their loss," Uhuru said.
