Electricity producer KenGen expects to cut the cost of drilling for geothermal steam by 41.67 per cent after acquiring three more rigs, raising hopes of a drop in power bills in coming years.The new equipment, geothermal resources development manager Peketsa Mangi said, will save the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firmmillions of shillings it has been spending to hire rigs.He said the cost of drilling wells is likely to fall to $3.5 million (Sh358.05 million) from $6 million (Sh613.80 million).&ldquo;This is a drop of around 40 per cent in terms of cost, and this is a boost in accessing more geothermal power which is more reliable and affordable compared to hydro or thermal,&rdquo; Mangi said.He said the high amount is to blame for the slow pace of developing geothermal power resources, with the country&rsquo;s potential estimated at10,000 megawatts.&ldquo;We currently have 287 geothermal wells in Olkaria, and with the acquisition of the rigs we expect we will be doing at least five wells every year,&rdquo; Mangi said in Naivasha.Two of the rigs have the capacity to drill wells that are between five and seven kilometres deep.&ldquo;The two rigs will drill vertically while the third rig can drill 2.5km. We expect to increase the number of wells and geothermal generated through them,&rdquo; he said.On geothermal exploration, Mangi noted that works on the 140MW Olkaria V power plant will kick off early next year.&ldquo;The project, which is funded by JICA, will not interfere with the nearby communities. It&rsquo;s part of the government plans to increase the amount of power generated from geothermal,&rdquo; he said.The manager said plans are underway to feed the national grid 292MW between 2018 and 2019, with projections of 2,500MW by 2025.&ldquo;Currently geothermal is contributing 1,632MW to the national grid and this is set to increase in the coming years due to the commitment by thegovernment and development partners,&rdquo; Mangi said.The geothermal manager noted that geothermal contributes 51 per cent of power used in the country.
