Kanu secretary general Nick Salat wants the Supreme Court to review a judgement it delivered last year which declared Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan as validly elected.Salat through lawyer Titus Koceyo said there are exceptional errors on the judgement that warrant a review.In an application before the Supreme Court deputy registrar Ann Asugah, Koceyo said even though the apex court held that scrutiny and recount is to ensure transparency in an electoral process, the court went ahead and upheld a decision by judge Agrey Muchelule who declined a scrutiny and recount of votes.Appellate judges Patrick Kiage, Gatembu Kiarie and M Inoti Kathurima heard the appeal case.Kiarie and Kathurima upheld justice Muchelule s decision while Kiage dissented.Koceyo said a there will be injustice if the court does not address the issues raised in his client s petition.He said his suit raises legal issues which meet the threshold set by the Supreme Court Act and requires determination by the judges headed by Chief Justice David Maraga.Others are Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, judges Mohamed Ibrahim, Jacktone Ojwang, Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung u and Isaac Lenaola.In the same court, an election loser wants a review of an election petition which determined Nyando MP Fred Outa was elected in a free and fair election.Jared Okeyo of Ford Kenya lost the election petition at the High Court.
