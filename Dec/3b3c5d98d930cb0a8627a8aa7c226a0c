The vaccination will cost Sh6 million.The programme aims to reduce the spread of the two diseases. It will end on December 23.Residents who plan to slaughter their cattle during the Festive Season, however, have been urged not to take them for vaccination since freshly vaccinated animals are not good for human consumption.
