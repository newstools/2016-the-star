Ulinzi Stars winger Samuel Onyango says the best of him is yet to be seen after coming into the team in the second leg and making a significant impact.Onyango scored twice in the league and a similar number in the GOtv Shield, plus a host of assists but says that is not the best of him.&ldquo;I know what I am capable of; I know what I can do and next season, the best of me will come out. I came into the team in mid-season and I feel I integrated very well with the team. I can say my performance has been okay but there is so much I need to improve on ,&rdquo; Onyango said on the soldiers official team portal.The versatile attacker added that the he was welcomed so well into the team and he didn&rsquo;t feel like a stranger.&ldquo;Within a few days of training, I had already gelled well with my team-mates and getting into the starting team made it better,&rdquo; the winger added. Also motivating him ahead of next season is the prospect of playing continental football and he says he wants to leave a mark by helping the team do well.&ldquo;That is a big stage and any player would want to play at that level. It is an opportunity for me to help the team achieve bigger things. We have set the targets as a team and I have also set my own targets and we will work hard to see them achieved,&rdquo; Onyango remarked.&ldquo;I would also want to help the team win at least one trophy in the country. We came close this season in the GOtv Shield and it was unfortunate we lost in the final. We have picked lessons though and next season, we should see better things,&rdquo; the midfielder, who joined Ulinzi from Sony Sugar concluded.
