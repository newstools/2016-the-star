The Kisii senator post is likely to be the most hotly contested if the calibre of aspirants is anything to by.High-profile Kenyans have shown interest, including Kenya&rsquo;s ambassador to the UN-Habitat Sam Ongeri, former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara, former Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution chairman Charles Nyachae and former nominated MP George Nyamweya.Incumbent Senator Chris Obure wants to run for governor, according to the Kisii Unity Caucus.In the March 4, 2013, general election, Obure ran on the ODM ticket and won with 120,351 votes, Ongeri (TNA) was second with 106,325 votes and Magara (PDP) third with 100,754 votes.Nyamweya was also in the race, while Nyachae will make his debut in elective politics next year.Political standLast week, Ongeri said he is still in the race. He said he will back Governor James Ongwae&rsquo;s reelection bid.Ongeri is keeping his cards close to his chest, saying that between March and May next year he will declare on which party ticket he will contest. He has denied joining ODM, even after declaring support for Ongwae, who was elected governor on the ODM ticket.Ongeri said, &ldquo;I am in Jubilee and I have not defected to ODM. The Constitution does not prevent me from working with the governor because he is from a different party.&rdquo;He is unhappy after being left out of the Jubilee presidential campaign team and has made his displeasure public.Caucus selects candidatesThe entry of Nyachae would, however, complicate matters. He is being fronted by the Kisii Unity Caucus for senator and Obure for governor.Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong&rsquo;i recently told the Star that they have settled on Obure and Nyachae as Jubilee candidates.Ongeri, Nyamweya and Magara are in a group opposed to the caucus, and accuse the members of being self-seekers.&ldquo;We will not accept a situation where a few individuals go to State House and then come back here proudly stating that they have the mandate to represent Jubilee,&rdquo; Ongeri said.Don&rsquo;t run away, face me in pollsThe former Foreign Affairs minister criticised Senator Obure for running against Governor Ongwae.&ldquo;Why is he running away from the senator position? He should contest the position and face me in the elections,&rdquo; Ongeri said.Nyachae defended their push for Omogusii Unity, saying it aims at long-term harmony and not just for next year&rsquo;s election.He urged residents to vote for him because he can easily reach President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss issues affecting them.
