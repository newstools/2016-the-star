As various political parties continue to align and realign themselves with diverse alliances and coalitions, Kanu&rsquo;s body language is, to say the least, a bit confusing, politically speaking.The party&rsquo;s top leadership has been sending mixed signals to the electorate. They have never really been consistent on who they intend to work with.Mid-this year, during the Raila Odinga-led anti-IEBC demos, Kanu was in the forefront. Kanu&rsquo;s secretary general Nick Salat was captured on TV and other media dodging teargas canisters and bullets alongside other opposition leaders.But when asked whether Kanu was jumping into a political partnership with Cord, Gideon was witty as usual. He said Kanu was in the demonstrations because, like Cord and other Kenyans, it wants free and fair elections next year.But pundits read more into that brief remark; they said Gideon and Raila could be planning an alliance next year.A few months later, Gideon was seen at a fundraiser in Ukambani. It was no coincidence that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was seated beside him.Less than a week ago, West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, a close Gideon ally, told a political gathering in the county that Kanu will throw its weight behind President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection next year.When the Jubilee Party was launched as a new political vehicle in September, it gobbled up more than 10 political parties in a single gulp, but Gideon refused to fold Kanu, saying that would be foolhardy because when the time comes for power-sharing, he wouldn&rsquo;t have any clout to bargain with.Kanu supported the Jubilee Coalition at the 2013 election, the political supremacy battles in Rift Valley rent asunder Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s fragile relationship with Gideon.It is imperative to note that Ruto&rsquo;s beef with Gideon has not affected the relationship between Uhuru and the favourite son of retired President Daniel arap Moi.This is why Gideon is at a crossroads. If he supports Uhuru, he will indirectly be supporting his political enemy, the Deputy President.Last week, Gideon was among top opposition leaders crafting the National Super Alliance outfit, the ogre believed to be the only antidote against Jubilee attempts to retain power next year.Nasa&rsquo;s proposed lineup has Gideon as one of two Deputy Presidents.This is strategic. This slot puts Gideon at par with Ruto in the political pecking order. The voters will therefore be convinced to vote for Nasa.
