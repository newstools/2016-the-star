Jubilee leaders yesterday accused Cord leader Raila Odinga of working with some Western nations, which they did not name, to get power through unconstitutional means.Turning the heat on the opposition chief, 20 MPs, led by National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale, said Raila&rsquo;s penchant for a shortcut to power is the &ldquo;reason he doesn&rsquo;t accept election results&rdquo;.They criticised the former Prime Minister and &ldquo;his foreign benefactors&rdquo; for trying to redraw the International Criminal Court script used in the 2013 polls to push for regime change in Kenya.Raila, attending the Wiper Delegates&rsquo; Convention in Kasarani, Nairobi, on Tuesday, said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto should have been locked up by the ICC throughout the hearing of their cases at The Hague.The leaders, who addressed a press conference at the Serena Hotel, said Raila has invited donor funding with the objective of influencing the outcome of next year&rsquo;s election.&ldquo;He and his foreign masters aspire to take Kenya into the unchartered darkness of chaos and undemocratic takeover, institutional sabotage and constitutional overthrow,&rdquo; they said in a statement read by Duale.The leaders said Raila and the opposition have sensed defeat at the 2017 polls and &ldquo;are now planning and premeditating violence after the general election&rdquo;. Alluding to Raila&rsquo;s remarks, the Jubilee MPs said the Cord leader and his allies still view the ICC as a useful instrument for regime change in Kenya.&ldquo;Odinga is not a believer in democracy as he purports. He is power-hungry and believes in nothing but self,&rdquo; the MPs said.The legislators said Raila&rsquo;s undemocratic credentials, &ldquo;riddled with a record of election results rejection,&rdquo; are the main reason he has been trying to destroy the electoral commission, &ldquo;like he does whenever he loses an election&rdquo;.Duale said Raila&rsquo;s demand that Kenya remain at The Hague-based court doesn&rsquo;t hold any water as he is not the Commander-In-Chief and doesn&rsquo;t possess the instruments for such a task. They urged him to quit politics, dismissing NASA as nothing to make Uhuru and Jubilee scared of the next election.
