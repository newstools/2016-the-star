ODM MPs have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to break his "studious silence on the the ravaging public health care crisis".The six MPs asked Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto to call off their political campaigns and prioritise ending the health workers' strike. The perceived inaction of the two leaders on the doctors and nurses strike which started on Monday has stoked criticism from various quarters.The President is currently in Ukambani region and is expected to head to Kericho and Nyamira counties later on to launch various projects.Uhuru, while on the tours, has also stepped up campaigns for his 2017 re-election bid in what the legislators termed "abandoning the country".Addressing a press conference Parliament Buildings on Wednesday, the leaders condemned Uhuru and DP for the "political engagements at the expense of most urgent matters".They condemned Uhuru for his "business-as-usual" approach to the crisis and demanded action today.ODM said it had initiated the recall of Parliament from a two-month recess for a joint session on the strike that entered day three on Wednesday.MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Florence Mutua (Busia), Fred Outa (Nyando), Zuleka Hassan (Nominated) spoke to journalists on the matter.National Assembly health committee members Raphael Otaalo (Lurambi) and James Nyikal (Seme) also attended the press conference.The politicians blamed the strike on the national government which they said has clung to billions of shillings meant for devolved functions."The time to show leadership is now. We demand that the President cuts short his political campaigns and intervenes for normal health services to resume.The legislators also noted in a statement read by Wandayi that Kenyans need to be saved from the anguish and pain they are going through.Wandayi, who is the ODM secretary for political affairs, said Jubilee orchestrated the full-blown crisis in the health sector.They said this started after the defunct Transition Authority failed to properly cost all the devolved functions."Jubilee blocked costing of the functions as a deliberate move to retain billions at its disposal and make it available for Jubilee thieves," he said."We concur that the doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers deserve better terms of employment, which county governments cannot offer presently because Jubilee is sitting on monies and some functions meant for the counties."Read: Lamu nurses withdraw from union, end strike over frustrationBureti MP Leonard Sang has drafted a constitutional amendment bill seeking to revert the health function to the national government.Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2016 proposes amendments to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution by deleting a key section that devolves the health function.If the bill sails through, national referral health facilities, pharmacies, ambulance services, promotion of primary health care, licensing and control of undertakings that sell food to the public will be managed by the national government.Also read: Striking nurses agree to hold talks with CS Mailu
