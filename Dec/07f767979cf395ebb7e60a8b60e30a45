Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata has accused Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura of allegedly using goons to intimidate him.The MP, who has declared his interest for the Senate seat, said the senator has been using the youth to interfere with his campaigns.Kang'ata on Monday cited his manifesto launch at Kenol town on December 3, where a group of youths chanted Kembi&rsquo;s name.The youths also distributed pamphlets, saying the MP supported the move by the Murang&rsquo;a Water and Sanitation Company to increase water tariffs by 75 per cent last year.Kang'ata said the youths attempted to shout him down and disrupt his event.&ldquo;I had to tell my supporters to leave them alone to prevent a fight from breaking out,&rdquo; the MP said.He said it is unfortunate that the senator, who has been criticising Governor Mwangi Wairia for using goons in his politics, is now using the same tactic.Kang&rsquo;ata said Kembi has been critiquing his decision to conduct medical camps in the county, saying it is not the role of a senator.In his manifesto, the MP pledged to spread the medical camps to all parts of the county.During the Jamhuri Day celebrations, Kembi told Murang&rsquo;a town residents the primary role of a senator is to oversight the county government.The Senator also criticised Kang&rsquo;ata&rsquo;s pledge to unite Murang&rsquo;a leaders, saying the Senate seat requires a leader who can face corrupt leaders without forging friendships that may compromise him.But Kang&rsquo;ata said he lobbies for money to conduct the medical camps to offer services to residents. He said he started the initiative in 2002, when he was the councillor for Township ward.&ldquo;If the senator does not have the heart to assist the needy, then he should let those willing do so without criticism,&rdquo; Kang&rsquo;ata said.The MP said despite their political differences, he respects the senator.
