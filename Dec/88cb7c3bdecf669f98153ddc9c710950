Cord leader Raila Odinga discussed Kenya's political landscape with Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto when he visited him in Chepalungu on Saturday.Raila, Rutto's Chama Cha Mashinani party and other opposition outfits are believed to be setting up an alliance that will unite them ahead of 2017 general elections.The alliance is a potentially formidable initiative uniting them against President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee Party.It aims to undermine DP William Ruto's influence in his South Rift Valley backyard, where some leaders are shepherding the key region's voters away from the ruling Jubilee coalition.The Governor said they also discussed matters of national interest, including devolution.Expert comment: Rutto's massive face-saving strategyAlso read: Gideon Moi to be DP in Nasa line-upThe opposition leader posted pictures of him and Rutto on Facebook, eliciting reactions by Kenyans who either supported or dismissed the 'alliance'.Cord leader Raila Odinga with Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto at the latter's Chepalungu home, December 3, 2016. /COURTESY"What we want is for the Jubilee government to go home," said James Wekesa.User Chicharito Iddy congratulated the "father of democracy" for "striking a political deal".But Laban Koros said the DP will not be defeated even if Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter are included in the alliance."When King Ruto, whom you fear more than death, starts his politics he will reduce you people to nothing...
