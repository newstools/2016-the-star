Pokot leaders led by Pokot South MP David Pkosing told Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday that the community supports Jubilee because Kanu had failed them.&ldquo;We have been in Kanu and the previous governments for more than 50 years and our community has no tangible development project that it can be proud of,&rdquo; he said when a delegation of Pokot leaders and residents visited Ruto&rsquo;s Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu.&ldquo;Our major problem in West Pokot was underdevelopment. Today, Jubilee has initiated many development projects including building a teachers&rsquo; college, a medical college, expanding irrigation schemes, construction of roads, among others, and some people are telling us not to work with Jubilee? No way,&rdquo; Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said.
