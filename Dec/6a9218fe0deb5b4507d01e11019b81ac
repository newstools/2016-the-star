Two groups in Athi River want the East African Portland Cement company to consider them in plans to sell part of its land. In a press briefing on November 17, EAPC board chairman William Lay said the land in Mavoko could fetch Sh8 billion. He said the SGR project may take up about 160 acres at Sh5 million per acre, while the Export Processing Zone is also interested in the land for expansion.But Kathama and Syokimau-Mavoko community associations say they should be the beneficiaries. Kathama chairman Peter Mwandia said it is unfair for EAPC to sell the land at Sh5 million per acre.
