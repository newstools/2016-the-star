Governor Evans Kidero has rejected the proposal to scrap Nairobi as a county and revert its leadership to the national government.Kidero said at the Wiper national delegates conference on Tuesday that the idea was demeaning to residents."It is wrong for people who do not even represent the people of Nairobi to try and change our ways of leadership and representation," he said.Kidero's sentiments were echoed by Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke who told off Murang'a Senator Kembi Gitura.Mueke told Gitura, who drafted the proposed bill, to stick to his mandate of representing the people of his county.Read: Nairobi to be scrapped as county in proposed lawThe bill seeks to give the President powers to nominate a Cabinet Secretary to head Nairobi.It seeks to amend the constitution so as to reduce the number of counties to 46 by excluding Nairobi from the ambit of county governments.The proposal may open a new battlefront between Jubilee and Cord; Kidero was elected on an ODM ticket in the 2013 general election.
