Abubakar Ahmed Bini is an Islamic cleric who has cut out a rare image in the Rift Valley where he spearheads unity among all religious groups mainly Muslims and Christians for the benefit of all.Bini is the chairman of the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya (CIPK) in the region. He has teamed up with Catholic Bishop of Eldoret Cornelius Korir and together they have initiated inter-faith dialogue that has for the first time seen Muslim clerics visit churches and Bishops or pastors entering mosques.He is also the chairman of Baitul-Mal group and Madrasa Hudah Foundation all which engage in charity work with the former mainly assisting the aged, widows and the poor to access basic needs in society. Much of what I do is voluntary. I don t earn any salary or allowances but I always feel so gratified when my work is recognised especially when it impacts on the lives of the people particularly the poor or less fortunate in our region, he says.The outspoken cleric only went through Islamic studies in the course of his life. He describes himself as an all round master of initiatives aimed at making society a better place.From peace initiatives, the fight against alcoholism and drug abuse, activism against human rights abuses, corruption along with other ills in society, Bini hardly shies away from speaking out his mind. He actively participates in programmes aimed at changing the society for good. This has earned him recognition from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) and the government which on many occasions calls on him among other key religious leaders whenever there are burning issues to sort out.Recently NCIC Chairman Francis Ole Kaparo walked into a peace forum in Eldoret and immediately recognized Bini whom he praised for his activism of peace issues.Two years ago, the killing of more than 140 people at Garrissa University College sparked off tensions between Muslims and Christians but Bini was among the first clerics in the region to go out preaching tolerance. Terrorism hurts all mankind including Muslims and I had to go out and explain to people that not all Muslims are terrorists and that not all terrorists are Muslims. These are criminals misusing our religion and we should not allow them to divide us along religious lines because that is their main interest, he says.The problem of alcoholism and drug abuse among youth is very serious and he was given chance to serve at the National Agency for Control of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) he would give all his heart to the fight.
