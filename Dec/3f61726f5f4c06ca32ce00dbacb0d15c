Governors are in court to block the implementation of Water Act, which they say takes over their roles and places it under the national government. In a suit filed under a certificate of urgency, the Council of Governors wants temporary orders restraining Water CS Eugene Wamalwa and his agents from implementing the new law, &ldquo;as it contravenes the Constitution&rdquo;. The Act establishes a centralised framework for provision of water and sanitation services. It also excludes the county governments in the performance of the shared functions of the two levels of government. The new law also diverts funds meant for county governments or shared between the two levels of government to multiple state agencies. As a result, the county governments feel the new law undermines devolution and ought not to be allowed to stand. The counties say it was enacted without consultation and in disregard of their concerns.
