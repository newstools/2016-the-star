Cord leader Raila Odinga is not opposed to talks to form a mega opposition to dethrone Jubilee, he says. He spoke at Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s home in Chepalungu on Saturday, where they held a three-hour meeting. The two declined to divulge what they talked about, insisting it was a normal visit between friends. This comes at a time when Rutto has strongly criticised Jubilee.
