Kenha has been urged to mark speed bumps and erect sign posts on the Thika-Garrisa highway and the Machakos-Kitui road to prevent accidents.Yatta MP Francis Mwangangi on Saturday said many accidents have occurred on the stretch between Kithimani and Matuu on the Thika-Garrisa highway and between Machakos and Kitui because of unmarked speed bumps.He said marking the bumps will ensure drivers unfamiliar with the roads take precaution and avoid causing accidents, especially during the festive season.Mwangangi also urged the National Transport and Safety Authority to be vigilant to ensure no deaths occur. He urged motorists to be careful and avoid drink. &ldquo;We do not want to lose lives and end up mourning instead of celebrating Christmas,&rdquo; Mwangangi said.
