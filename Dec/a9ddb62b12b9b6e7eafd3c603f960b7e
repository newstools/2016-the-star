Victims of road accidents between Soko Mjinga and Kimende on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway have complained of being robbed of their mobile phones, valuables and cash.Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said the government has received several complaints that the first responders at the accident scene usually steal their valuables and flee without helping them.Koros speaking during the Jamhuri Day celebrations at Soko Mjinga on Monday.He said those who arrive early at accident scenes are mainly idlers in trading centres near the highway.&ldquo;It is very shameful for someone to struggle to snatch a wallet, money, wrist watch and mobile phones from a person who needs your help. We shall follow up and beef up our surveillance on our roads to reduce such incidences,&rdquo; Koros said.Anyone found stealing will be prosecuted, the commissioner warned.The event was attended by area MP Mburu Kahangara, Kinale MCA Njuguna Mureithi and politicians Jonah Mburu and Mwenda Wanene.Koros said the area between Soko Mjinga and Kimende is covered by Kinale Forest on either side and accidents cause huge traffic jams.&ldquo;I urge motorists using this road to be patient whenever an accident happens because everyone wants to go. Some of our youth are quick to assist them to use [muddy] village roads where the vehicles will get stuck and they will extort money from the motorists to help push the cars,&rdquo; he said.
