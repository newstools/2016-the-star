Alon Orland of Uganda came in second in MX50 with Tanav Choda of Kenya completing the podium dash. Dekker Kihara, who is a former MX50 champion and Nandi Kiplagat cruised to second and third positions respectively in MX65, completing an emphatic Kenyan clean sweep.But the Orland brothers Aviv and Stav made up for Alon&rsquo;s undoing in MX50 as they rode to a scintillating 1-2 Ugandan finish in MX85 ahead of Christian Chege of Kenya as Fortune Ssentamu of Team Uganda placed fifth. Barrack Orland, who is the father of Stav, Alon and Aviv brothers emerged the winner in the veterans and masters category, beating compatriot Mbambasi Ashiraf and home oldie Moses Mugo to the podium tussle.
