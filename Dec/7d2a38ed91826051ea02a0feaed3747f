Ignore the opposition's rhetoric and propaganda in its quest for power, Bungoma senator hopeful Juma Mukhwana has urged Kenyans. He said the country has made tremendous progress that is now being undermined by the rush for votes.Mukhwana spoke on Wednesday when he was hosted on the KBC TV breakfast show Good Morning Kenya. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto need to be given ample time to serve Kenyans.''We all know that the Jubilee administration has enabled wananchi get the SGR, water projects, electricity and key road projects are being done across the country. That is what Kenyans need, not empty politics of dividing people,'' he said.
