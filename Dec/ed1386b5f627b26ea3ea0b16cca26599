The government will this month launch a campaign to end violence against women.The campaign called Jitokeze will be a joint programme by the Gender ministry and UN Women.They will also launch and activate a hotline number, 1195, where victims can report such cases. Gender-based violence remains one of the most pervasive human rights violations of our time and is endemic in Kenya. In particular, violence against women and girls is worryingly high. Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki said in a statement.Female genital mutilation and child marriages are some of the violations meted on girls and women in the country, despite them being outlawed.The Demographic Health Survey released in 2014 shows that 47 per cent of women and 40 per cent of men aged between 15 49 had experienced either physical or sexual violence at the hands of their partners or spouses. The GBV is still prevalent, despite the existence of legislative frameworks, judicial sanctions, advocacy and sensitisation efforts that have been put in place. The government s Medium-Term Plan II has prioritised it as a key gender issue that needs to be tackled urgently, Kariuki said.Statistics from the Gender Violence Recovery Centre shows that the country records close to 3,000 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, of this number 1,172 are children. Ninety per cent of these acts were done by people who are known by the victim. The Protection against Domestic Violence Act is one of the laws drafted by nominated Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo to help in the fight against the problem.
