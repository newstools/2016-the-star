Embu residents have castigated area senator Lenny Kivuti for sending Christmas and New Year well-wishes on SMS instead of 'giving them gifts to mark the festivities'.They said that the senator, known as a flamboyant politician, could have done better than package his message on a 30-word text.While some of them hit at the legislator for only playing politics with the well-wishes, others said he could have called the needy to his home for a feast.Peterson Murithi, a resident from Runyenjes, said the lawmaker "is rich enough to send a Christmas gift to every household in the county'."He is wealthy and therefore could have sent goodies to every household instead of sending cheap SMSs," Murithi said.Others were shocked at how the senator obtained their phone numbers, most them saying that Kivuti must be a smart politician."I have never met the senator. I only see him on TV. I don&rsquo;t know how he got my number," one Peter Muthee said.Some of the residents who received the message said they had no problem with it, saying the senator personally reached their hearts.But all the same, a section of the residents said the senator should have put the message on a billboard from which the county would have benefited."He would have mounted billboards with the messages since that way the county would have got revenue from him," a social media user said.Caroline Mukami joked that the senator should have sent them money through Mpesa since he (Kivuti) obtained their numbers."The senator would have organised a mega Christmas party at his home and invite the needy in the community," Mukami said.Ambrose Njeru, one of Kivuti's handlers, told the Star that the SMS was to publicly reach out to every resident who owns a mobile phone."We decided to use that channel since its cheaper and more convenient compared to printing Christmas and New Year cards," he said.He said that they reached to more than 100,000 voters in just a click of a button.Read: Gideon Moi's Christmas wishes billboard stirs political debate in Baringo
