The business fraternity can now access and submit trade licence and public health certificate application forms through the e-TL global system.Governor Jack Ranguma said the system is aims to enhance revenue collection and ease business by enhancing accountability, transparency and efficiency. The rollout will begin in Kisumu town before it is expanded to seven subcounties. Ranguma said the e-TL, formerly known as the single business permit, will transform the way business is done.A recent World Bank report on the ease of doing business in Kenya ranked Kisumu the best county. World Bank representative Frank Twagira said besides promoting an environment that encourages external investment, Kisumu is one of the counties where you can get the fastest approval for building plans. He said the digital system has reduced the human tendency to delay processes because it is devoid of bureaucracy. iThe e-TL is an automated web-based system used to process applications for trade licences and public health certificates to new businesses and renewal of the documents for existing businesses.Twagira said the county worked with the World Bank Group to design, develop, test and deploy the system.
