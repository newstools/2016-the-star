If I breastfeed, blood oozes from the baby&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; said the mother.Letoluai and her parents are having sleepless nights to comfort their ailing baby from pain. &ldquo;I spent most of my time in forest burning charcoal to earn money that is not even enough to buy food for my seven little children.
