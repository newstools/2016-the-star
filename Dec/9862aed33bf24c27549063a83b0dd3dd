Kanu yesterday warned President Uhuru Kenyatta not to sign the electoral amendments or it will join Cord during the January 4 demonstrations. Party secretary general Nick Salat said the new amendments do not represent the views of Kenyans and were geared towards satisfying individual interests. &ldquo;The rigging has started very early. We cannot sit, wait and watch. We want Kenyans to exercise their right and elect the people who can serve them,&rdquo; he said. Salat said, despite having an agreement with Jubilee, Kanu will not entertain policies that go against the will of Kenyans. He said the state wants to rig the elections to impose leaders on the electorate. &ldquo;We have seen high levels of corruption and our people isolated in many areas because some of the leaders in this government are serving individual interests. We want good leadership and that is why we have to elect the people we want,&rdquo; Salat said.
