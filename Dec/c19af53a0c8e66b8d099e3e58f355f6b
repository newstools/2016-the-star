The Kenya Revenue Authority has suspended a clearing and forwarding company involved in the tax evasion scheme involving 24 containers which were nabbed on Thursday. Multi-agency detectives at the Port of Mombasa said Tranvistar Clearing and Forwarding Company and two others &ndash; yet to be identified &ndash; cleared the 40-feet containers in unclear circumstances last week. The containers had new garments and milk powder which had not been declared. They were discovered after being subjected to scanning. KRA, which intercepted the containers before they left the port, said the government would have lost an estimated Sh75 million had the consignments been sneaked into the market. Out of the 24 containers, 21 had new garments and shoes disguised as cold rooms being imported by horticultural firms. Three of the containers had milk powder disguised as flasks and sewing machines. Transvistar Clearing and Forwarding cleared 10 of the containers. Detectives are tracing the other two clearing companies involved in the syndicate. The milk powder, Hilwa, was manufactured in the United Arab Emirates. The Star learnt the three clearing and forwarding firms used company names of horticultural located in Nairobi and Uganda as consignees. KRA chief manager for port operations Joseph Kaguru said they have written to the horticultural companies to help in the investigations. &ldquo;The horticulture directors should sue the clearing agents for using their company names without notification,&rdquo; he said. KRA recently acquired three more scanners to enhance capacity in intercepting contraband goods at the port.
