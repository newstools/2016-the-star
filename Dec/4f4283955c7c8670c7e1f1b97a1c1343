ANC has asked the Jubilee government to withdraw its stand criminalising civic education. President Uhuru Kenyatta in his Jamhuri Day speech alleged that foreign powers are financing regime change on the pretext of providing civic education through civil society organisations.But ANC secretary general Godfrey Osotsi in a statement released on Saturday said this as an affront to the principle of public participation in governance and decision making.&ldquo;As a party we demand that the Jubilee leadership immediately disembark from this project of disregarding and circumventing the Constitution to create primitive, criminal and outdated opportunities,&rdquo; the statement reads.A bygone eraOsotsi said the government has no right to block Kenyans from enjoying their constitutional rights.&ldquo;We urge the civil society to quickly explore judicial and constitutional ways of fighting for their right to undertake civic education and stop the government from frustrating their noble and patriotic work,&rdquo; the statement reads.He said transferring the NGO Council from the Devolution ministry to Interior is part of a scheme to frustrate and demobilise civil society groups. In March, Uhuru appointed ex-police commissioner Hussein Ali, his former co-accused at the ICC, as the chair of the NGO Coordination Board.Osotsi said Jubilee is just like Kanu, even its actions are a continuation of the crimes against citizens carried out by the Nyayo regime.&ldquo;It is such tendencies and turning the police and other security organs of the state against the population that made Kanu extremely unpopular and led to its rejection and final removal from power,&rdquo; the statement reads. The PBO Act 2013, which gives the non-profit sector total independence and protection, has been delayed.
