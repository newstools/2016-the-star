It will now be forwarded to the Senate for input. The House adjourned until February 7 next year, when they resume the Fourth session.The Bill also increases the number of voters in a polling stations from 500 to 700.The elections Act Amendment Bill passed in September after a protracted political negotiation had set the number of voters in a polling station at not more than 500.This increased the total number of polling stations by 13,000, raising the cost of election by more than Sh10 billion.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had warned that there aren't enough public facilities to facilitate the additional polling stations.The law requires polling stations be demarcated in either a hospital, school and any other public facility.Under the amended law, those wishing to be nominated as members of the county assemblies must have a degree from a recognised university.Initially, those seeking election as MPs needed to have at least a certificate earned after studying for at least three months in a post-secondary school institution.When the Act was being prepared in 2011, affected MPs successfully lobbied former President Mwai Kibaki and then Prime Minister Raila Odinga to have those contesting in the 2013 elections exempted from that requirement.
