Second the Administration Police to the counties to enforce revenue collection, Governor William Kabogo has urged the national government. This way county revenues would increase by 300 per cent, he said.Kabogo said corruption and insufficient support from the national government are the reasons the counties have not achieved their full potential. He said the counties have lost a lot of money through loopholes in revenue collection and embezzlement.&ldquo;I do not want to politicise this matter but the support of the national government to the counties is quite wanting. We are not in a position to realise the full potential of the counties because there is no reinforcement,&rdquo; the Kiambu governor said.Kabogo was speaking in Mombasa. He urged the county administrations to automate revenue collection to curb the loss of funds. &ldquo;The share counties get from the national government is not enough to bring change. We have to increase it through revenues,&rdquo; he said.Kabogo said since Kiambu county automated its system, revenue has doubled in just two years. This year Kiambu has collected Sh2.47 billion up from Sh1.1 billion last year.&ldquo;Sixty per cent of the money in the county disappears into people&rsquo;s pockets. Automation is the only way to ensure that all revenues go to the government,&rdquo; he said. Kabogo attributed the success to integrated ICT in the county&rsquo;s financial management system. &ldquo;This system is creating transparency. The private sector has shown interest because they know where to place their money,&rdquo; he said.
