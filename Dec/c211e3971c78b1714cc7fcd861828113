Cord leader Raila Odinga beat President Uhuru Kenyatta in a twitter opinion poll sanctioned by lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi on Tuesday.In the poll, 60 per cent of the lawyer's followers who voted said they will back Raila if election for presidency were held today.At least 40 per cent of the 'voters', who the Star cannot independently verify, said they will back Uhuru for a second term."Polls closed. A total 7,012 voters cast their votes. Uhuru 40%...Raila 60%," Ahmednasir said, "This is a scientific polling...don't worry...no rigging here..."Senators, journalists, politicians are among those who took part in the poll which stirred heated debate on the lawyer's timeline.The results re-ignited the conversation on credibility of opinion polls in the country, which most commentators dismissed as a sham."@ahmednasirlaw current results makes one wonder about the recent released opinion poll on the same?," Esther Passaris, Nairobi businesswoman, said.Other users said the poll was not scientific therefore unreliable while others claimed that the polls were being re-tweeted by Cord supporters."Tired argument. Do your research better," former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth said.Read: Bad elections in 2017 are cookingJournalist James Smart said: "@ahmednasirlaw your poll is more reliable than Ipsos,"In a quick rejoinder Ahmednasir said: "@jamessmat ...and I can confess that 65 to 70% of my Kenyan twitter followers identify themselves as 'Jubilee'..."The opinion poll was heavily criticised and endorsed by users in equal measure, with others saying it does not reflect the situation ahead of the 2017 general election."The fact that, the likes of @jamessmat have re-tweeted this and his followers are Corded, makes your poll null and void," a user said.Khaemba Peter &rlm;said: "Retweeting doesn't interfere with the results. It only widens the sample space which makes it more reliable,"Another user Brian Amecha said: "The same opinion polls misled the US that Clinton was favourite over Trump and my choice should remain a secret bruh, not so?""@ahmednasirlaw @IpsosKe Now this is Real Opinion Polls.
