Lawyers yesterday dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s remarks during Jamuhuri Day, where the head of state criticised and warned the civil society against carrying out civic education programmes.Through Law Society of Kenya president Isaac Okero, lawyers asked Uhuru to accept criticism and work with all people to champion the interests of Kenyans.Okero said the civil society in Kenya has played a critical role in election preparation since the advent of multi-party politics, to open the democratic space and ensure good governance.He said Kenyans in the civil society ought to be encouraged and facilitated to assist their fellow citizens to be best prepared to participate in the general election, whether as candidates or voters, and whether such assistance is through the IEBC or other state agencies or by direct engagement with the public should be immaterial.&ldquo;Elections in Kenya are not simply a matter of casting a vote. Kenyans need to be fully informed on how the electoral system works and what the political structure is,&rdquo; Okero said.He said the civil society groups&rsquo; role in civic education is to ensure Kenyans can identify issues that concern them, know how to address the issues and how to hold elected leaders and government officials accountable.Okero said it is the role of the state to protect citizens from any external threat, including that directed at the electoral process.&ldquo;Following the recent elections in the US, we see that nation grappling with the prospect that there may have been illegal interference in their electoral systems by a rival superpower. But general statements demonising Kenya&rsquo;s civil society are unfortunate and unnecessary,&rdquo; Okero said in a statement.
