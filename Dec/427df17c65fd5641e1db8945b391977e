Land CS Jacob Kaimenyi yesterday accused land cartels and dishonest ministry officials of frustrating the digitising of land records.He said 13 registries will be digitised by the end of the year. Kaimenyi said this will seal loopholes associated with the manual system of keeping land records, while another five will be completed by 2017.&ldquo;Let us not resist change as temptation to resist is very high,&rdquo; he said at Crown Plaza Hotel during a land administration workshop.The digitisation of land records is aimed at enhancing efficiency, taming corruption and eliminating cases of missing records.This effort might, however, be frustrated by cartels uncomfortable with the reforms.Kaimenyi advised beneficiaries of the manual system to brace for a &ldquo;rude shock&rdquo;, as their activities will be &ldquo;confined to the annals of history once all 57 registries have been digitised&rdquo;.The programme will cost Sh800 million.The CS said the ease of doing business will significantly improve once all the registries have been digitised.&ldquo;Digitising land registries will improve record-keeping, improve revenue generation and improve record tracking to avoid cases of files disappearing,&rdquo; Kaimenyi said.During the workshop, Kaimenyi told ministry officials to get ready for change.lame excusesHe said it is easy for people to find lame excuses that can easily be eliminated by partnering with other organisations. &ldquo;It is possible to have a database of land in the entire country,&rdquo; he said.Kaimenyi said digitisation is in line with the ministry&rsquo;s vision of being a globally competitive institution in land management.&ldquo;Since technology has been developing so fast and making our work easier by the day, and with innovation in ICT, I believe without a shred of doubt that we can be a world-class institution that serves its citizens sufficiently in real time, up-to-date information about land and related resources,&rdquo; he said.Land PS Mariamu Elmaawy said the manual system is inefficient and allows a lot of loopholes that have been utilised in the past to fleece Kenyans.&ldquo;We have great resources in the country. Let us overcome our fears,&rdquo; she said.
