The Asian Development Bank slightly lowered its 2016 growth forecast for developing Asia yesterday, reflecting slower-than-expected expansion in India. Developing Asia, which groups 45 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is now expected to expand 5.6 per cent this year, rather than 5.7 per cent, the ADB said in a supplement to its Asian Development Outlook 2016. The ADB trimmed its 2016 growth estimate for India to 7.0 per cent from 7.4 per cent due to weak investment, agricultural slowdown and the government's recent demonetization.
