Former Education minister Margaret Kamar has joined the Jubilee Party and has formally said she will run for the Uasin Gishu Senate seat.She will seek to unseat Senator Isaac Melly.&ldquo;I will heed the advice of my supporters and run for the Senate seat through the Jubilee Party ticket,&rdquo; Kamar said on Tuesday.She spoke during a thanksgiving ceremony for her supporters in Eldoret town.Kamar said if elected, she will fight for strong legislation on devolution and look into ways of improving education in Uasin Gishu county.In 2013, Kamar vied for Uasin Gishu governor on the ODM ticket, but was beaten by Governor Jackson Mandago. She was a close ally of Cord leader Raila Odinga.There have been reports that she is interested in the governor position, but she withdrew her bid mid-this year. &ldquo;I will vie through the party which is popular in this region,&rdquo; Kamar said.There has also been speculation that she may join the National Vision Party, headed by former minister Nicholas Biwott.Former Judiciary Chief Registrar Gladys Shollei is also said to be interested in the county Senate seat. She has, however, not formally declared her interest.Kamar comes from the Keiyo community, the second largest Kalenjin subtribe in the county. She enjoys support among other communities in the region. &ldquo;We will support her bid, because we know she has good leadership qualities,&rdquo; Kanu official Paul Kibet said.He said they had wanted Kamar to run for governor, but her decision to shift to the Senate position is also wise.In October, Kamar said her experience will help her fight for more resources for the county. She said she will work with all the communities to ensure devolution succeeds.
