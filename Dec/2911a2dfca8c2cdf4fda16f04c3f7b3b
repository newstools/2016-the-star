Avocado farmers in Murang&rsquo;a county have been paid Sh45 million bonuses for fruits sold this year to Kakuzi Foods Processing Company.The farmers supplied 1,100 tonnes of avocados, earning Sh10 million more than the Sh35 million bonuses they were paid last year. Nyeri, Kiambu and Embu shared Sh10 million in the payout. Kakuzi MD Paul Mbugua released the money to Murang&rsquo;a Cooperatives executive Edward Muiruri on Monday for disbursement to farmers. He said there is a high demand for high-quality fruits internationally. He said the farmers got more money this year because they increased the quantity of fruit delivered.Mbugua said brokers have been promising farmers increased prices to lure them away from the agreements they signed with Kakuzi. The Murang&rsquo;a government negotiated with the firm on behalf of the farmers for increased prices for their fruits in 2013. The contract ensured farmers fetched Sh8 and above for one fruit, depending on size. This is a huge increase from the Sh1.50 brokers had been paying.
