The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) and the Nurses Union are mobilizing doctors and nurses to commence their countrywide strike on Monday. Daisy Korir who is the treasurer in the doctors union said they have exhausted all avenues for dialogue with the government and the only option is for them to down their tools in order to fight better terms and conditions of service.Korir added that they want the government to implement a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. We have given all we could so that we engage the government and the SRC but they have ignored us and we have no option but to go on strike as from Monday , said Dr Korir.She accused the government of ignoring the plight of health workers causing frequent strikes in the sector. We signed the CBA three years ago and even went to court but our pleas to have the agreement implemented have fallen on deaf ears. We are forced to take the painful action of doing tools so that we get our right , said Dr Korir.She said members of the public should be aware of the possible lack of services in all hospitals as from Monday and seek alternative means if they will need treatment.The Nurses Union also says all its members will join the doctors strike on Monday to push for better terms and conditions of service.The unions secretary general Seth Panyako said that nurses have been frustrated with poor pay and unfavorable working conditions adding that counties have refused to sign a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with them.
