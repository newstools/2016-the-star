Governors in Nyanza and Western have ganged up to protect themselves against charges of corruption for fear of senators running against them, Kisumu senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o has said.&ldquo;Their panic as senators challenge them in the elections has led them to make some of the most demagogic and stupid claims to justify clinging to their positions,&rdquo; he said in a statement.Nyong&rsquo;o wants to run for Kisumu governor post, currently held by Jack Ranguma.He dismissed remarks by Kakamega&rsquo;s Wycliffe Oparanya that current governors deserve two terms.On Sunday in Kisumu, Oparanya told Nyong&rsquo;o to abandon his governor bid because he is &ldquo;old&rdquo;.Separately, Oparanya termed his rivals retarded children. He said governors have spent four years putting in place structures and need a second term to ensure stability and success of devolution. But Nyong&rsquo;o said, &ldquo;Oparanya claimed recently [that] governors were elected to serve two terms. Wrong. Five years, and if your record is poor, voters will send you home without much ado. It does not matter how much you bad-mouth Prof Nyong&rsquo;o.&rdquo; Oparanya and Ranguma&rsquo;s development records are wanting and they should be ready to face their opponents in 2017, he said.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic Wycliffe. Stick to Kakamega and don&rsquo;t run away from the onslaught by Senator [Boni] Khalwale.&rdquo;Leaders who want to run for Kakamega governor include Khalwale, former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe, businesswoman Mabel Muruli and former Kakamega Sports executive Suleiman Sumba.Other senators who want to run for governor include Kennedy Okong&rsquo;o (Nyamira), James Orengo (Siaya), Hassan Omar (Mombasa), Mike Sonko (Nairobi) and Chris Obure (Kisii).
