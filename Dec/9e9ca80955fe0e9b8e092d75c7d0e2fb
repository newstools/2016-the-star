Residents in some of the area where East African Portland Cement has proposed to dispose off parcels of land it owns want to be given first priority in the planned sale. The country's third largest cement maker by market share said on November 17 it planned to sell part of its 13,000 acres to help it return to profitability. The company plans to raise about Sh8 billion from the proposed transaction. The proceeds are earmarked for retiring of about Sh5 billion debt and retrench about 1,000 of its 1,500 workforce at a cost of about Sh2 billion.A recent report by the Office of the Auditor-General Edward Ouko has cast doubt on the firm&rsquo;s ability to stay afloat with liabilities amounting to Sh4.9 billion against an asset value of Sh2.11 billion. EAPCC chairman William Lay however said on November 17 the publicly traded firm was &ldquo;asset-rich but cash poor&rdquo;.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need a bailout by the government. Instead we are presenting a solution which requires minimum intervention that will turnaround the company and position it for growth,&rdquo; he said.The plan to sell the vast land has however to be approved by the Cabinet, with firm having placed the proposal through the department of Trade under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Co-operative Development. This is because the Athi River-based company is controlled 52.3 per cent by the state &ndash; 25.3 per cent directly through Ministry of Trade and 27 per cent through National Social Security Fund. Rival Bamburi Cement, controlled by France's Lafarge Group, owns a 41 per cent stake in EAPCC.Athi River residents have however asked to be considered in plan to sell the vast EAPCC land.&ldquo;More than 300 families are living in the farm but we have not been able to start public utilities like schools and hospital because the title is still under Portland,&rdquo; Syokimau/Mavoko Community Association chairman Pius Musembi said.Musembi asked the company to fast-track the transfer of the title deed to the locals, saying they occupied the land to safeguard against grabbing private developers.Reports have indicated the government may acquire land for expansion of the Export Processing Zone and also as a migration passage for the wildlife from the Nairobi National Park.The cost for an acre is estimated at Sh5 million based on the 2,000 acres offered to government for Sh10 billion.The locals, however,say they cannot match the Sh5 million quotation.&ldquo;We the locals cannot afford to pay the quoted price and we believe this has been done deliberately to lock us out of this deal yet according to the law we should be the first people to benefit out of this land,&rdquo; Kathama Welfare Association chairman Peter Mwandia said.The two groups claimed they have had correspondences with the company since 2010 when it first announced its intention to dispose the land.
