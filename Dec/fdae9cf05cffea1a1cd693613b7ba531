The government should sufficiently fund the Konza City Development Authority to realise the dream of an ICT hub, a legislator has said.Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga questioned the government&rsquo;s commitment to the capital-intensive project, arguing funding has been insufficient. The project in Machakos county, he said, was key to transforming Kenya&rsquo;s under-performing economy given growing number of innovative technopreneurs.&ldquo;The idea behind Konza City is a great one, but it is unfortunate the government is not paying sufficient attention to this project,&rdquo; he said on Thursday.
