A Jubilee aspirant has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take charge of the party operations. Speaking at a Nairobi hotel, Starehe MP aspirant Francis Mwangi said Uhuru should be seen as being in charge of the party to avert chaos. He said his visibility will deter elected leaders from interfering with party operations and pushing for their own interests at the expense of JP. Mwangi said different factions are emerging after elections of officials. He said if the President doesn't take charge, the divisions will hurt the party as aspirants will feel left out. Mwangi said all aspirants should be given a fair and equal chance."Some sitting MPs are in charge of the presidential campaign. Will they really be fair? The President needs to be in charge to ensure everyone has an equal chance," Mwangi said. He said some Jubilee officials treat other party members as inferior. "We have paid the Sh30, 000 fee for registration. We are serious party members, not inferior to anyone," he said. Mwangi said the party should mobilise youth across the country to register in large numbers to defeat Cord.
