Kenya head into the Cape Town Sevens with a lot to fight forAfter undergoing a &ldquo;baptism of fire&rdquo;, Shujaa head coach Innocent Simiyu will be heading heads high into the Cape Town Sevens that kicks off this afternoon in South Africa hoping to atone for the mistakes his charges made during the first leg.Shujaa were bundled out of the Challenge Trophy semi-final by USA after a 19-21 loss and they will have to win at least two matches in their pool to make it to the Main Cup quarter-final, having fallen short during the Dubai Sevens, where they earned five points finishing 12th overall.Simiyu promised to work on Shujaa&rsquo;s defence which was a major let down, as well as the discipline at the breakdowns that cost them a lot of penalties. Kenya also lost a lot of possession due to poor decision making and attack patterns.Shujaa will start their campaign against France &ldquo;Les Bleus&rdquo; at 12.43pm. Kenya had a low record against the French side last season winning once out of their four meetings. Les Bleus won 28-26 in Cape Town last year, 33-7 in Dubai, 24-21 in Vancouver, Canada in March and won 24-5 over Shujaa in Paris. The Kenyans only beat them in Singapore 28-7. They recently beat Shujaa 24-14 during the concluded Dubai Sevens.Shujaa will face Fiji later at 4:26pm in the second Pool &ldquo;B&rdquo; match and need be wary of the form their opponents are in. Shujaa won once out of their four meetings, 33-7 in Singapore. They lost 12-28 in Sydney, 19-24 in Las Vegas, and 10-12 in Hong Kong. The Fijians are known to be big and powerful and have very carefully planned off-loads. Should Kenya tame Fiji&rsquo;s horses, they may end up thrashing them like they did while winning the Singapore Sevens last season.Fiji are the current back to back World Sevens champions.Their last group stage match will be against Japan at 7:15 pm. Japan shocked them after a 31-7 thrashing at the Rio Olympics. Kenya had earlier also lost to the Japanese 19-14 in Las Vegas and their only wins against the Asians came in Dubai, where they won 17-12 last season and 17-7 recently.Earlier when Simiyu took over, he set a 100-points target with 10 points in each leg and a Cup quarter final finish and he still has time to achieve that.Defending champions The Blitzboks of Sourth Africa are heading into the tournament as favourites having won Gold after beating Fiji 26-14 at the Dubai Sevens. Last year they beat a stubborn Argentina. They have home advantage and are in great form leading the World Series standings with 22 points in their basket. They start their Pool &ldquo;A&rdquo; matches against Russia at 1.49pm, then USA at 5.10 pm before winding up against Australia at 8.56pm.Uganda will be the other African representatives having attained a core status in the HSBC World Rugby Series. They start against Wales in the Pool &ldquo;D&rdquo; at 11.37 am, Scotland at 2.36pm before playing Samoa at 5.57pm.After a poor start in Dubai, New Zealand will be hoping to bounce back from their position 8. They will start their Pool &ldquo;C&rdquo; campaign against Argentina at 11.59 am, Canada at 3.20 pm before closing their group stages high against England at 7.03pm.
