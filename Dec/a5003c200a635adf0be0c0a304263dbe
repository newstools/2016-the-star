Mombasa is notorious for traffic jams but these are expected to be nightmares of the past when feeder roads and highways are built. The wait will be three years.Kenya National Highways Authority communication manager Charles Njogu on Thursday said the roads will ease congestion, enhance connectivity and improve regional integration. These are some of the biggest infrastructural projects at the coastal city in more than 20 years. The major projects include the dualling and improvement of the Port Reitz and the Moi International Airport access roads, rehabilitation of the 53.4km Bachuma Gate to Maji ya Chumvi section along the main Mombasa&ndash;Nairobi artery, and the dualling of the Mombasa&ndash;Mariakani highway. The Mwatate&ndash;Taveta road is being constructed, as well as the multinational weighbridge station at Mariakani. Kenha is also constructing the Mombasa Southern or Dongo Kundu Bypass as part of the new Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project. &ldquo;These projects are in various implementation stages and are expected to improve not only the intake and evacuation of cargo from the Port of Mombasa, but also decongest the city, open up the South Coast to tourism and other development,&rdquo; Njogu said.Kenha is also constructing the Mombasa Northern Bypass, which will run from Miritini to the North Coast. It will also rehabilitate the Lunga Lunga&ndash;Malindi transport corridor.Due to increased cargo to and from the Mombasa port and increased traffic volumes, the Mombasa&ndash;Mariakani section has remained a bottleneck to traffic flow in and out of Mombasa.Njogu said that Kenha recently awarded the tender for the rehabilitation Phase 1 of this section, which will cover Mombasa&ndash;Jomvu.&ldquo;The project road is important for the Northern Corridor, which links the Port of Mombasa to the landlocked Eastern and Central African countries of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo,&rdquo; he said.
