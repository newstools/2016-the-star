CORD has dashed to court, seeking to prevent President Uhuru Kenyatta from signing into law any changes to the election laws.The opposition moved to court even as the Senate pushed the debate on the Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 to January 4, to allow the Legal Affairs and Human Rights committee chaired by Busia Senator Amos Wako to conduct public hearings.But even as the Senate pushed forward the debate on the controversial changes, Cord, under a certificate of urgency, asked the High Court to block Parliament and the Executive from handling any Bill touching on changing the Elections Act.Through lawyer James Orengo, Cord argued that the electoral system is currently in a state of confusion and the proposed amendments will undermine the important and fundamental features and provisions of the electoral laws.The most controversial clause in the Bill gives the Independent Boundaries and Electoral Commission powers to use manual voting in case there is failure in the electronic system.Cord asked the court to issues orders prohibiting &ldquo;any further proceedings, business, transactions, decisions including sittings, debates, approvals and parliamentary mediation on Bills and assents to Bills&rdquo; concerning the General Election.The President is the only person with the constitutional mandate to assent Bills into law once passed by Parliament.Last week, the Jubilee side in the National Assembly pushed through the amendments to the election laws, despite protest from Cord.In court, High Court Judge Edward Muriithi certified the application by Cord as urgent and directed the parties appear in court today for an inter-partes hearing.He also directed Cord to file and serve their application on the Speakers of the National Assembly, the Senate and on the Attorney General.Cord also asked the court to quash the decision of the Speaker of the Senate that appointed a day for a special sitting yesterday.Cord accused the National Assembly of acting irrationally and oppressively by introducing proposals that were rejected in the enactment of the Election Laws (Amendment) Act and in any case before the expiry of six months or at the end of a session or term.It argued that the Assembly and the Senate have contravened Standing Orders numbers 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136 and 138 of the National Assembly, including the procedures set for purposes of dealing with proposed amendments in committees of the Whole House.&ldquo;It is irrational and unreasonable to change the law when the electoral process has begun. The actions of the Assembly and the Senate undermine and violate the national values and principles and are dividing the country to disunity, misrule and threatening the peace, security and law and order,&rdquo; he said.The court heard that it is unfair and an act of bad faith to convene the Houses of Parliament giving short notices when a big number of legislators are on holiday or out of jurisdiction.Cord argued that &ldquo;Peace, security, law and order and the safety and security of citizens and their property are likely to be compromised if the debate and legislation affecting the electoral law is not undertaken with the involvement of all stakeholders, including political parties.&rdquo;In the Senate, the Speaker directed that the Legal Affairs committee conduct public hearings and table its report on January 4, when another special sitting is expected to be held.&ldquo;I accordingly direct that the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, in accordance with Articles117 and 118 of the Constitution, scrutinizes the Bill and undertakes public participation commencing immediately today after the First Reading of the Bill in the Senate and prepares its report,&rdquo; the Speaker ruled.&ldquo;The Committee should engage all stakeholders in the election process and take into consideration all issues that have been raised regarding the contents of this Bill,&rdquo; he added.Ethuro said senators will consider debate and vote on whether to pass or reject the Bill on the same date, saying the matter is urgent and of national importance.&ldquo;It is also not lost on us that we are counting down to the General Election now due in just eight months. For these reasons, it is imperative that any legislation concerning the manner in which the election shall be conducted be disposed of and concluded well ahead of time, so that the public and all players are clear about the rules that shall apply,&rdquo; he said.He called on the senators to display maturity and sobriety as the country is looking up to the Senate.&ldquo;They expect from the Senate nothing less than a sober reflection and circumspection on the issues before us. Debate robustly. Hold different views. It is your prerogative. But please do so with decency and decorum and in accordance with the Constitution, the laws and the rules of this House,&rdquo; he said.
