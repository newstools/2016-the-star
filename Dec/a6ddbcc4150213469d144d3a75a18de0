COTU boss Francis Atwoli has accused a senior politician from Rift Valley of bribing some Luhya MPs to boycott a rally he is set to host on Saturday.Atwoli, the brainchild of the December 31 rally where the community is set to name its preferred presidential candidate, said attempts to divide the community will fail."This person should keep off Luhya politics. Why should the politician resort to bribing Luhya MPs not to attend the event?" he asked. "The community's votes will 'be cast in one basket'. Do these people triumph when we remain divided?" Atwoli asked during an interview with the Star on Thursday.He warned the legislators from the region 'against being used by outsiders to fight the unity of Luhya community'."This is a journey that I started in 2012 where I hosted Luhya kingpins in Maasai Mara. It cannot and will not be stopped by anyone," Atwoli said. He said that MPs claiming that they were not consulted are lying "because they were part of the planning from the beginning"."Despite the fact that all have been invited, I want to also personally extend the same to them as the rally will be peaceful," he said.He further urged the community's elders to desist from being used to oppose the progress of the Luhya nation."They should therefore step aside and watch the December 31 declaration which will put to an end all the political brokerage of Western Kenya," Atwoli said. He added that those who will go against the person who will be unveiled will risk being politically irrelevant.Read: Kakamega MPs to skip Atwoli's meeting, cite lack of consultation on plan to name presidential candidateAlso read: Khalwale: Atwoli's rally to name Luhya preferred presidential candidate is 'sideshow'
