Uptake of pension plans by small and medium-sized enterprises is steadily rising, an industry official said yesterday, underlining the need for savings for life after retirement. "The reason why the personal pension plan is growing is because in the economy it is the small and medium enterprises which are growing. And these are the people who are actually coming in to set aside funds for their retirement,&rdquo; Jubilee Insurance general manager for employee benefits David Ogega said. &ldquo;You only get the big companies once in a while.&rdquo; Speaking at the Jubilee Insurance Personal Pension Plan's annual general meeting in Nairobi, Omega said the scheme has registered a 16.67 per cent growth in members to 21,000 this year compared to 18,000 in November last year. The scheme, he added, is looking to invest in corporate bonds and offshore ventures to bolster returns for members.
