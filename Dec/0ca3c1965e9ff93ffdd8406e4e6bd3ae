The Meru county government spends Sh70 million on sanitation and prevention of communicable diseases annually, Public Health director Ephantus Kariuki has said.The health sector has faced several problems in maintaining and improving hygiene because many residents lack toilets.Kariuki on Wednesday said open defecation contaminates water sources, causing communicable diseases. He said despite this, the Health department&rsquo;s public awareness efforts are beginning to bear fruit.Kariuki said as part of the county&rsquo;s campaign to prevent cholera outbreak, several residents have been arrested by public health officers and charged in a court of law with failing to have toilets or latrines.&ldquo;A large proportion of Kenyans bear the greatest burden of preventable ill health, with the hardest-hit being women and children,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Preventable diseases contribute to over 80 per cent of all hospital admissions.&rdquo;In January, several people were diagnosed with E. coli bacteria infection, which is associated with consumption of contaminated water or illicit brews.The county has established more health monitoring units and is implementing a community health volunteer strategy.The units have increased significantly to 143 from 41 in 2013. The number of volunteers has risen to 2,402 from 1,115 in 2013.&ldquo;Implementation of a community health strategy continues to yield better outcomes. Meru did not record any case of cholera when most neighbouring counties were hit hard,&rdquo; Kariuki said.Health executive William Muraah has been in the forefront in sensitising residents on sanitation. He has been holding public forums across the county.&ldquo;Building toilets and good hygiene is the only weapon to eradicate diseases. We are arresting those who don&rsquo;t have them,&rdquo; Muraah said in Karama during a public forum mid-this month.There have been significant measures to promote public health and safety. In February, food vending along the Meru-Tharaka border were banned following a cholera outbreak.&ldquo;All food outlets and hotels have been closed and we are encouraging people to take food from their homes,&rdquo; Mt Kenya Region Regional Manager Gitonga Mugambi said. &ldquo;We have also issued out chlorine and aqua tabs to treat the water and contain the endemic spread of cholera.&rdquo;Two people died in two weeks following the outbreak which was reported in Gatithini, Mukothima and Kithima areas along the border.Mugambi said more than 100 cholera-related cases were reported in Gatithini, Mukothima and Marimanti areas.
