Governor Evans Kidero has denied his officers were involved in the intimidation and forced eviction of an elderly couple and bulldozing of their property in Westlands.On Wednesday, he told a press conference that City Hall has written to the National Land Commission, demanding information on all expired leases.He appeared to heap blame on the commission, saying it might have renewed the lease for another person without consulting the county government.The merciless destruction early on Sunday was shown on television, creating an uproar.The house of Purin Kurji, 74, and his 70-year-old wife was flattened by a bulldozer. This was after the property was invaded and smashed by about 20 men armed with pangas and rungus.They were told a developer, Francis Njeru of Frank Logistics, had taken over ownership.Njeru was arrested and released on Wednesday, as investigations continue into the eviction and destruction.&ldquo;We saw an advert that the NLC called the claimants of that particular to its offices on December 9 to discuss this matter. But we have never recommended the commission to renew this particular lease,&rdquo; Kidero said.Efforts to reach the commission were unsuccessful. Phone calls to NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri went unanswered.Kidero said although the 99-year lease for the land LR No.1870/1/337 had expired, the county had not recommended the commission renew it, as nobody had applied.&ldquo;We have been investigating since this occurred and we have confirmed that enforcement notice Number 5500 did not originate from us and the person by the name J Oduol who signed it does not work here,&rdquo; Kidero said.The governor said the county is the custodian of public land and thus any lease renewal by the commission must be authorised by the county.&ldquo;Since 2013, we have renewed only two leases from two applications and this particular case is not one of them. We want know if the commission made other renewals without our input,&rdquo; Kidero said.On Wednesday, senior resident magistrate Hellen Onkwani ordered developer Njeru released on Sh300,000 bail, pending investigations. She dismissed the police application for seven more days of remand.The prosecution told the court police need to investigate the ownership of the disputed land and some documents that Njeru is in possession of, which they claim were forged.
