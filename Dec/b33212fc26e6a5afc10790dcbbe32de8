A case in which State House director of digital communication Dennis Itumbi is seeking Sh50 million compensation from the Attorney General will be determined on February 7, 2017.Itumbi wants to be compensated for being detained in 2012 over suspected interference with ICC cases. He said his constitutional right to privacy was violated when his home was raided and his computer searched.In a letter dated December 22, 2014 to AG Githu Muigai, Itumbi said he wants the office to admit liability.He noted that in January 2012, ICC chief prosecutor Luis Ocampo reported that he was investigating interference with witnesses in the case against President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and Radio journalist Joshua arap Sang.He said the court did not issue any arrest warrant but that police raided his residence in Kiambu and confiscated his mobile phone and laptop to access his private information.Itumbi sued the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Inspector General of Police in June 2015, demanding compensation for unlawful arrest for allegedly hacking into ICC system.He added that the refusal to close the file was causing him anxiety and uncertainty, given that the ICC pre-trial brief released on January 19, 2015 had not implicated him in any way.Itumbi also submitted that his arrest and four-day detention violated his right to protection, freedom and privacy, and denied him the right to a fair hearing and release on bail.He swore that even after being denied access to a lawyer, he promised to cooperate with the investigators, but was still denied bail."I was directed to make weekly appearances at the CID headquarters and later summoned by the parliamentary committee on defence," he said.The ruling will be delivered by justice Joseph Onguto.Read: Itumbi sues state over 2012 arrestAlso read: State wants Itumbi pay suit dismissed
