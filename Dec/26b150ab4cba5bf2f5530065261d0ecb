The Narok county government will implement an environmental health law to improve sanitation.County Public Health officer Daniel Sironka said the bill is being discussed by interested parties before it is taken to the County Assembly. It will ensure proper management of waste and protect water sources from pollution. &ldquo;Those who defecate, urinate, throw waste haphazardly or release raw sewageinto the river will face the law,&rdquo; Sironka said at a meeting. Sironka said the Constitution guarantees all Kenyans a clean environment and proper healthcare. He said the county has few latrines. To address the shortage, the Public Health department has embarked on a campaign called Community Total Sanitation to create awareness of the importance of using toilets.
