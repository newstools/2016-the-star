The government has suspended vaccination of more than 10 million children against polio because of the doctors&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; strike.Qualified medics were to coordinate the drive and administer the vaccine in 15 high-risk counties between December 10 and December 14, where the government fears polio might reappear.Health Promotion Unit head Dr Sammy Mahugu said the drive has been pushed to next year. &ldquo;Due to unavoidable circumstances, the December 10-14 polio campaign has been postponed to January 18-22,&rdquo; he said.Targeted counties include Nairobi, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Turkana, Lamu, Tana River, Isiolo, Samburu, West pokot. Others are Uasin Gishu, Busia, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. &ldquo;The campaign targets 33 per cent of children under the age of five,&rdquo; Medical Services director Dr Jackson Kioko (pictured) said.There are concerns that these children have now been left vulnerable in case there is an outbreak. The ministry fears the crippling virus might hit the country, after it reappeared in Nigeria three months ago.Kenya has been polio-free since 2006, but it has experienced several importations of wild polio virus in 2009, 2011 and 2013. The virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and can cause paralysis.Most infected people do not develop symptoms at all or may have mild symptoms, which include fever, tiredness, headache, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. Some people develop muscle paralysis and die if the respiratory muscles are attacked.
