President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised veteran politician John Keen as a man who was generous with his time and property.Uhuru also said Keen, who died on Christmas Day, was outspoken about what he believed was right, and committed to a strong government that worked for its people."In colonial times, he stood firm in defence of African rights. By 1962, his energy and devotion to nationalist ideals had made him Kanu's organising secretary. In that position, he prepared the party for the elections which saw an African government take power in this country for the first time," he said in a statement on Sunday."With his passing we have lost a man who fought for our liberty, and a patriot who served Kenya selflessly. His name will not soon be forgotten. May God rest his soul in perpetual peace, and may He console the family, and grant them the courage to bear this loss."Read: Veteran politician John Keen dies aged 90Also read: Uhuru, Raila mourn late minister William ole NtimamaCord leader Raila Odinga noted the country has lost yet another member of the "increasingly thinning number of those great Kenyans who fought for and negotiated Kenya&rsquo;s independence here at home at the Lancaster Constitutional Conferences in London, in the United Kingdom".Raila said Keen had been a friend to whom he turned for discussions on matters of national interest."His passing is a personal loss," he said in a statement on Sunday.
