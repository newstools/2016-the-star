COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli has asked the senate to reject the amended election laws that are expected to be presented for debate at the August House on Wednesday.Atwoli said the changes, made during a stormy special sitting of the National Assembly on December 22, "are not in good faith"."The Senate should live-up to its expectation as the Upper House and refuse to pass the contentious amendments to the laws that will govern our 2017 general election," Atwoli said in a statement on Monday.The Senate is expected to reconvene a special sitting to debate and either pass or reject amendments to Electoral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016.Atwoli said the senate should present itself as an alternative House for national guidance and further urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to assent to the laws."Cotu calls upon the President, being a symbol of national unity and an institution that all Kenyans, irrespective of their political party affiliations, look upon amid such sharp divisions in the country, not to Assent to the Bill," he said."He should send it back for consensus building and dialogue among legislators from both sides of the House...for sake of peace and harmony among Kenyans after the August 2017 Elections," Atwoli said.The secretary general said the passing of the election law was uncalled for in such an "emotive and acrimonious" sitting of MPs.Read: Raila gives Uhuru nine-day ultimatum on election laws, says demos a last resortAlso read: Election law changes &lsquo;may trigger post-poll chaos&rsquo;More on this: Battle on poll laws moves to Senate session"It is evident some individuals have allowed power to get into their heads and use the August House to pass archaic legislation," he said.He said the passing of the law will only divide Kenyans even more, "as it is only meant to serve a few individuals"."Passing of any laws that aims at serving individuals will never take Kenya to next anticipated levels," Atwoli said.On Monday, Cord leader Raila Odinga gave the government a nine-day ultimatum to reverse the amended election laws or the opposition proceeds with its plan for mass action.
