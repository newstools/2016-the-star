Landlords with apartments along the stretch of the Nairobi-Nakuru highway to be expanded are staring at empty houses and zero income. Many of our tenants have moved out without notice for fear of their property being destroyed, John Makibia said.He is chairman of Muguga Highway Residents Forum. The 25km stretch to be expanded is between James Gichuru Road and Rironi, Limuru.Makibia said the Kenya National Highway Authority placed beacons in August and informed them construction would begin in November.He said despite the government promising to compensate owners of flats, petrol stations and other businesses, it is yet to do so. Stress will kill usMakibia, who was accompanied by more than 200 members of the association, said Kenha has not responded to their questions on when the compensation will begin.They spoke at Muguga in Kikuyu constituency on Wednesday. Secretary Kamau Thumbi said more than 30 flats that stand about 500 metres from the highway are almost vacant, after tenants fled. Some of our members had bank loans, others are old and were using their retirement benefits. These people will die of stress. Others might be left homeless because the land they live on is an inheritance, he said.Thumbi urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene. He said farmers with land along the highway did not plant crops, despite the area being fertile with adequate rainfall.The first phase will begin at James Gichuru Road in Nairobi, with Kenha expected to clear all structures within 500 metres from the highway to create room for the expansion.The expansion will end at Rironi, where the highway branches to the Mai Mahiu road.
