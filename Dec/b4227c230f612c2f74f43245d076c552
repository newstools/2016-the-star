Three companies yesterday distanced themselves from a firm Zakhem International Construction which demanded an extra Sh10 billion to construct the Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline. The directors of Quality Inspectors, Straccon Engineering and Dynamic Green Technologies appeared before the Energy Committee yesterday. They said they have almost completed work and are not askingfor extra money.The committee chaired by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi was told Zakhem International Construction, awarded the Sh43 billion project in July 2014 to construct the pipeline has continued working despite its contract expiring in February. Quality Inspectors chief Chege Kiragu said his company was subcontracted by Zakhem in 2014. The other two firms were subcontracted later.
