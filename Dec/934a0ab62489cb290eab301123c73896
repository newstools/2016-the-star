Kenya Ferry Service chairman Seif Kajembe has urged the Mombasa government to allocate funds to the parastatal for efficient services.Currently, only the national government allocates funds to KFS. The county only draws cash from the facility, he said.Kajembe said Mombasa residents use the Likoni Channel crossing free of charge and it is upon the county to offset the bill. He, however, said KFS will not charge the commuters.&ldquo;We respect the county. I ask the county to disburse funds to the Kenya Ferry Services to support those people crossing the channel,&rdquo; Kajembe said on Monday. He spoke during the recommissioning of the MV Harambee, which was decommissioned a year ago. It was repaired at a cost of Sh143.5 million.Kajembe&rsquo;s demand is likely to cause conflict between the KFS management and Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s administration. The High Court last week barred the Mombasa administration from collecting revenue from KFS and commuters. The court directed the county to refund KFS millions of shillings in revenue lost after it unlawfully took over ferry services in February. The county must repay Sh2.5 million for each month and it will be Sh1.5 million for late payment every month. It is not yet clear whether the county will agree to set aside money to repay KFS. It has a huge recurrent expenditure and has been struggling to pay workers.
