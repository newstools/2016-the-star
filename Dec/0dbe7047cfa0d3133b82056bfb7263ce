Eight Kenyan and international human rights groups yesterday petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to form a commission of inquiry into violations by security agencies.The request comes as the world marks International Human Rights Day and just days after police rubbished a Haki Africa report. It documented 81 cases of police executions and enforced disappearances of alleged terror suspects at the Coast in four years.In a letter to the President, the human rights groups said independent research and media reports show credible evidence the Kenya Police Service, Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Wildlife Service and the National Intelligence Service have killed or tortured suspects of terror or other crimes. However, justice has been inconsistent and victims often have no avenues of redress. The groups said authorities fail to acknowledge or publicly condemn the abuses.&ldquo;Instead, government officials have denied such abuses occur without investigating the allegations and, in some instances, threatened families, and the media and human rights activists who advocate for justice for the victims,&rdquo; the letter says.&ldquo;Killings, torture and disappearances continue with no holding to account suspected security officers.&rdquo; The lobbies include the Kenya Human Rights Commission, International Justice, Haki Africa and the Independent Medico-Legal Unit.The state denies systematic abuse.
