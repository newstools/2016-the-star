Cord got a temporary win yesterday in its fight against the electoral commission after it obtained an order suspending the award of a Sh2.5 billion tender to supply ballot papers.High Court judge George Odunga stopped supply of papers by Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company, pending the hearing of a case filed by Cord through lawyer James Orengo.He said Cord has made an arguable case that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission awarded the tender using a repealed law.Odunga certified the matter urgent, saying it involves the general election, which is of great public interest, hence, the need to handle istt swiftly.His orders arose out of an application filed by Cord under certificate of urgency.In its suit papers, Cord says in the tender document, the specification for poll registers included &ldquo;principal register of voters&rdquo;, which is not provided for under the Election Act.It also said there is no evidence to demonstrate the &ldquo;principal register of voters&rdquo; is capable of being maintained on a public web portal in a format that can be inspected andverified for accuracy.The court was told the statutory forms currently in use for transmission of presidential election results are inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the elections law.Cord argued that it is irresponsible of the electoral commission to order supply of poll registers, ballot papers and result transmission forms without securing or specifying the devices to be used for identification of voters and transmission of results.The opposition also seeks an order requiring the IEBC to re-tender the contract for ballot papers. Cord says the awarding was contrary to election laws and the Public Procurement and Assets Disposal Act.
