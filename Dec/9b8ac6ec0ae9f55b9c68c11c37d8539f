After posting Kenya&rsquo;s best ever Olympics performance at the Rio Games, Kenya&rsquo;s best athletes were yesterday feted at a colourful ceremony held at Nandi Bears Club.The athletes received tokens of appreciation ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations.The event organised by Lotto Foundation and the Ministry of Sports was meant to recognise the athletes for their efforts in bringing glory to the country since the inception of Olympic Games.Among the athletes present were the year 1968 Olympic steeplechase silver medallist Ben Kogo, Ezekiel Kemboi, paralympians Samuel Muchai who won two gold medals and gold medallist Wilson Bii among other athletes. According to the world 3,000m steeplechase champion Ezekiel Kemboi, Kenya&rsquo;s performance at the games could not pass without celebrations.&ldquo;I am very delighted today that this event was organised to bringing together the athletes who competed at the Olympic Games. In most cases athletes are only celebrated when winning medals and after that no one cares,&rdquo; Kemboi, who was disqualified after stepping on the inner line at the Rio Games, said.Kemboi, who first represented Kenya at the 2004 Olympic Games encouraged athletes to remain disciplined if they are to last long on the track.&ldquo;The secret behind success in athletics is simply discipline. I won my first medal in 2004 when the current champion Conseslus Kipruto was in Class Four and I am still strong enough to take on him,&rdquo; Kemboi said.He said some of the athletes have fallen prey to the ill-motive agents who dupe them into using banned substances. &ldquo;If you want to be respected, train natural and win clean. Don&rsquo;t accept to be lured into using drugs. Many athletes who have taken that route have ended up ruining their career,&rdquo; Kemboi added.According to the Lotto Foundation chief operating office, Peter Ng&rsquo;eno, they are committed to the development of sports in the country.&ldquo;We were part of the country&rsquo;s Rio Olympic Games success and ensured our young and budding athletes got a chance to begin honing their skills on the world stage by supporting the Youth Commonwealth Team to Samoa last year,&rdquo; he added.Ng&rsquo;eno said they are looking forward for the 2020 Olympics adding that Kenya should field athletes in disciplines across the board.&ldquo;We extend a special mention to the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s rugby 7s teams that qualified for the games and joined the South African team as the only teams representing the African continent. We believe next time they will both bring medals home,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;eno said.Kenya won gold through David Rudisha (800m), Faith Kipyegon (1,500m), Conseslus Kipruto (3,000m SC), Vivian Cheruiyot (5,000m), Jemimah Sumgong (marathon) and Eliud Kipchoge (marathon).
