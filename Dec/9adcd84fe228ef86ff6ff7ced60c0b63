Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter showed up for Jubilee officials' elections in a red shirt, a sign that he may be warming up to the party he has severely criticised before.Keter wore the colour that is one of the party's and greeted the region&rsquo;s MPs, aspirants and citizens with the word 'Jubilee'.&ldquo;Tuko Pamoja&rdquo; the people responded quoting Jubilee's slogan which is Kiswahili for 'We are together'.Some said Keter had realised he will not make it next year if he continues attacking the party led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.&ldquo;I think he is now back and on the right track,&rdquo; one said during the exercise in Nandi county, on Tuesday.The MP did not take a moment's rest as he kept marshaling support for some of the candidates set for nomination and possible election.&ldquo;We must build the party and we need strong people. Who can we nominate?&rdquo; he asked during consultations with his group.Keter said two weeks ago that anyone supporting Jubilee was either corrupt or a fool.He quit the party saying he will defend his seat either as an independent candidate or join another party.But Ruto said during his visit to the region with the President last week that he had forgiven the MP and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi for straying from the ruling coalition.Read: I quit Jubilee, only foolish people can stay - Alfred KeterKeter has also criticised the government over matters including the Standard Gauge Railway construction and the Sh1.6 billion National Youth Service scandal.The bold and outspoken legislator once warned that Jubilee could lose in 2017 if the ongoing litany of corruption cases and massive loss of public funds are not resolved.More on this: Jubilee 'will lose' in 2017 - KeterAlso read: Ignore Jubilee's 'fake' promises ahead of March 7 by-poll, Alfred Keter tells KerichoThe MP broke into dance in the hall after the exercise that saw Sammy Biwott from Emgwen constituency elected the Nandi county Jubilee party chairman.Among MPs present were Corneli Serem (Aldai), Kirwa Stephen Bitok (Mosop) and Elijah Lagat (Chesumei), and Nandi County Governor Cleophas Lagat.
