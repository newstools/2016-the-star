West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo yesterday welcomed the decision by the IEBC to bar hopefuls and incumbents from contributing in harambees, saying it amounts to voter bribery.The IEBC has issued a directive urging those who are running for political seats to stop contributing in harambees from Thursday. Lonyangapuo, however, said harambees have helped develop this country and urged the directive be re-examined in the future so it does not undermine development.&ldquo;Many social activities have been set up through harambees,&rdquo; he said. The legislator said December is the month when many women&rsquo; groups engage in table banking and they need the support of their leaders to boost their ventures.&ldquo;Women have helped boost our economy through small businesses. We need to support them so they can expand them,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.
