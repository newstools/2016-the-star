THE Labour and Employment Relations Court will today rule on whether a warrant of arrest will be issued against officials of the Doctors union for defying court orders. Justice Hellen Wasilwa said she will give her decision today after the Council of Governors told the court that the doctors should be held in contempt of court for disobeying an order. The court had issued an order directing them to resume duty. However, the doctors through its Secretary General Fredrick Oluga said they only became fully aware of the content of Justice Nelson Abuodha&rsquo;s order on December 14. He added that they were not properly served with the order of the court. In the same court, the Council of County Governors and Kenya National Union of Nurses recorded a consent ending their prolonged strike. The strike called by the nurses&rsquo; union on November 14 was suspended and the two parties agreed to immediately sign a recognition agreement to lay basis for engagement of the parties on the labor relations.The parties also agreed that the county governments shall not discipline any nurse or union official on the account of participation on the said industrial action and withdrawal of their labor.This means that all court proceedings against the union on account of the strike will not proceed as the same was marked as withdrawn.The nurses and doctors had initially vowed not to resume duty until the Government implements a pay deal signed in 2013 awarding them a 300 percent pay increase.The nationwide strike called by the Doctors and Nurses began on December 5 after talks by the Health Ministry collapsed.According to demands by KPMDU, doctors want a 300 per cent salary increment as the CBA signed in 2013 stipulates. This should see the lowest paid doctors pocket Sh 342,000 and the highest pocket slightly over sh 940,000 away from the current remuneration of sh 500,000 for the highest paid and sh 40,000 for the lowest paid.
