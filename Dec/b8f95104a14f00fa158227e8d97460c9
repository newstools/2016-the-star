This interregnum between Christmas and New Year is an interesting one in Nairobi and the opening stanza of The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock by TS Eliot, came to my mind.Let us go then, you and I,When the evening is spread out against the skyLike a patient etherized upon a table;Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,The muttering retreats ... To lead you to an overwhelming question ...Oh, do not ask, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;Let us go and make our visit.So let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to take a look at the markets in 2016. It&rsquo;s been a dramatic year in the markets with big headline political events wrong-footing markets. The chances of Brexit and the election of President Trump were considered the equivalent of three legged ponies at the Epsom Derby, by the bookmakers. As we can see, the new Zeitgeist spread like wildfire, and the world at the end of 2016 looks nothing like it did at the beginning of the year. Vladimir Putin looks like the biggest geopolitical winner in 2016 and this has been reflected in the markets. The Russian Ruble has returned +21.31 per cent versus the dollar and is the top-performing currency versus the dollar in 2016. The Brazilian real was a close second at +20.96 per cent. Interestingly SSA clocked positions six through nine in the top 10 currency rankings in 2016; 6 Zambia Kwacha +11.96 per cent, 7. South Africa Rand +11.00 per cent, 8. Lesotho Loti +11.00 per cent, 9. Swaziland +11.00 per cent. 7. African currencies ranked in bottom 10 performers. The biggest African loser in 2016 was the Egyptian Pound which retreated -58.84 per cent, followed by the Nigeria Naira -36.68 per cent, Mozambique Metical -33.27 per cent, Congolese Franc -21.14 per cent. The British Pound retreated -16.99 per cent through 2016. The reason I am laying out the currency movements is because movements are material and can juice or trash a portfolio, in the blink of an eye. The Kenya shilling has held its own against the dollar when you factor in the carry (the interest rate you receive) and a stand-out in 2016. I expect the dollar to continue on another leg higher. The first leg kicked off on November 8, with the election of Donald Trump. I am of the view that sterling has room to pop to the upside in 2017. Closer to home, President Buhari has to capitulate and therefore I expect another fall in the Naira. The Congolese franc could go just about anywhere as buffers erode. The Zimbabwe bond note experiment is predicted to end in a debacle sooner rather than later.Aly-Khan is a financial analyst
