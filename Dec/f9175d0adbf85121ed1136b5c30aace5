Former President Daniel arap Moi has mourned the death of veteran politician John Keen, describing him as 'long-time personal friend and fellow freedom fighter'. In his message of condolence to the family through his spokesman Lee Njiru, Moi said he had been saddened by Keen's death.He recalled how they had met in 1955 and teamed up to give impetus to the struggle for freedom from colonial domination and for the dignity of the Africans."In this regard, Keen was energetic, passionate and fearless," Moi stated, adding that Keen served with diligence when he was an assistant minister."We prayed to God to give the bereaved family the necessary fortitude to bear the loss," the former head of state said on Wednesday.Separately, Nairobi county assembly speaker Alex Ole Magelo said that the death of Keen will not leave the Maasai community in despair.He told the Star on phone that the politicians death is a loss to the Maasai since Keen was one of the greatest elders from the community."We will continue to fight for the Maasai rights. Keen and the late Ntimama fought for the same and we will continue to do so. They were role models," Magelo said.Magelo said although Keens shoes are big to fill, the remaining community leaders wont despair.Keen died at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi on Christmas Day, aged 90; family members said he had been sick for some time but still managed his properties in Karen and Namanga.The late veteran politician will be buried on Friday in line with Maasai traditions.Keen once served as assistant minister during the reign of former President Daniel Moi in the 1980s.The Maasai politician served as Kajiado North MP from 1969 to 1979 under Kanu before falling out with Moi over the majimbo issue.He later joined retired President Mwai Kibaki and formed the Democratic Party which he served as Secretary General.Read: Veteran politician John Keen dies aged 90
