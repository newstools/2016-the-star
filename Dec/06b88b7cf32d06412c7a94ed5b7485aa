A cleric has told politicians to tone down statements on the electoral law changes to be discussed in the Senate today.Bishop Cyrus Githaka of the Episcopal Church, Mt Kenya region, yesterday said the hard positions being taken by the government and the opposition could lead to violence. &ldquo;In 2007 before the general election, politicians accused each other of plans to rig the elections. After the polls, many people died during the post-election violence,&rdquo; Githaka said in his office in Kagio town.Last week on Thursday, Jubilee MPs passed amendments to the electoral laws that were negotiated by a joint committee. The law proposed digital identification of voters, but the amendment introduced a system of both manual and electronic identification.Cord leader Raila Odinga has threatened to lead protests on January 4 unless the amendments are overturned by the Senate. Githaka urged the clergy to lead the country in calling for negotiations to avert a possible crisis that could lead to violence.
