Governors will sign recognition agreements with the nurses&rsquo; union today.Kenya National Union of Nurses&rsquo; general secretary Seth Panyako and other officials are expected at the Council of Governors&rsquo; offices this morning for the signing.CoG chairman Peter Munya said any negotiations on a Collective Bargaining Agreement will happen only after counties formally recognise the union.&ldquo;The recognition agreement will be signed between each county government and Knun. We have equally agreed to finalise the CBA by March 31, 2017,&rdquo; Munya said in a statement.Legally, any union should sign a recognition agreement with the employer before it can negotiate a CBA. Munya said the current CBA that nurses are referring to is not registered, hence null and void.Once a new CBA is developed and signed, it will be registered with the Labour ministry and the Labour Relations Court.
