Nine ODM rebels got a reprieve yesterday after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal barred the party from deregistering them and declaring their seats vacant.The nine are Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Viwandani MCA Sam Nyang&rsquo;wara and MPs Stephen Kariuki (Mathare), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), Samuel Arama (Nakuru West), Ababu Namwamba (Budalang&rsquo;i), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni), John Waluke (Sirisia) and Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga.They were handed a temporary lifeline when the Tribunal stopped the Orange party from expelling them, until their application challenging the decision is heard.The Tribunal is chaired by Kyalo Mbobu, with James Atema and Paul Ngotho as members. It directed the Registrar of Political Parties not to amend or alter the ODM membership list.In its ruling, the panel further told ODM that in the event the names have been removed from the party&rsquo;s register, they should be restored until the dispute is determined.The Tribunal members issued the orders after lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, appearing for the nine ODM rebels, said they feared the party would go ahead and illegally declare their seats vacant, forcing them to go for by-elections.The lawyer accused the party of failing to accord Namwamba and Mwahima a fair hearing during a recent disciplinary committee meeting. The rest of the members, Kilukumi said, were heard, despite their protest that ODM has not held party elections for the last 10 years.He said during the last NEC meeting at the Kasarani Gymnasium, no party officials were elected, as the meeting was disrupted by &ldquo;men in black&rdquo;.He submitted that ODM lacks a legally constituted NEC to discipline members deemed rebellious.&ldquo;The tribunal is satisfied there is imminent danger of the applicants being expelled from the party,&rdquo; the Tribunal ruled.Yesterday, it directed Kilukumi to serve ODM with the suit papers ahead of a hearing on December 15.The decision to expel the rebels was reached after they were found guilty of attending the launch of the Jubilee Party at the Kasarani Stadium on September 10. The nine want the court to rule that they did not violate the party&rsquo;s constitution in attending JP&rsquo;s launch and bar their expulsion.
