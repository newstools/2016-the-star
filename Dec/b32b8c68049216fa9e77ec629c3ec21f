ODM leaders have criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta over his remarks that NASA is tribal outfit with no agenda. They are Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, MPs Fred Outa (Nyando) and Oburu Oginga (nominated), Rose Nyamunga (Kisumu woman representative) and Rosa Buyu (ODM deputy organising secretary). They termed the remarks “desperate”. During a rally on Saturday, Outa said NASA is unstoppable. “Citizens are tired of this regime and it is high time they start packing to leave office,” he said. Oginga said Uhuru should accept criticism.
