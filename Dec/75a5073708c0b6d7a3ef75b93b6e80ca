Bungoma county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng' has urged millers to stop fighting for sugar cane.He said anybody engaging in violence or destruction of property because of cane poaching will be dealt with accordingly."We will not condone such acts anymore," Chepchieng' said.He urged millers to respect private farmers, saying they should not force them to sell their sugar cane."Respect private millers. No one should be forced to sell their cane to a particular miller. If we stick to the resolutions we made, we will be peaceful and hooliganism and cane poaching will stop," Chepchieng' said.He said the death of a Nzoia Sugar Company worker last week during a confrontation was unfortunate. Chepchieng said security agencies are on high alert."We warn those involved that they will be held accountable. We do not recognise economic crimes when one kills another, that is criminal and we will act accordingly," Chepchieng said.He said the removal of sugar cane zoning is still a proposal so millers should stick to the original zones.Chepchieng said millers from Western met and made resolutions on sugar cane harvesting.Meanwhile, farmers in Bungoma have said they should be allowed to sell their cane to the highest bidder.Speaking during a press conference in Bukembe, their leader Joseph Wasike said it is wrong to be dictated on where to sell their cane, yet the prices differ.&ldquo;This is liberal economy. Farmers should be allowed to sell their cane to whoever they want according to the price per tonne,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If a miller takes six months to pay after cane delivery, do you expect us to wait?&rdquo; Wasike said.
