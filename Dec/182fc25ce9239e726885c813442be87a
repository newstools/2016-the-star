I am told a scheme has been hatched to run a series of commentaries on TV, radio, newspapers and blogs to malign me and the Kenya Film and Classification Board because of our campaign on content regulation and moral values&hellip;Some evil men and women holding key positions in&hellip;media houses have even discussed how I should be removed from KFCB or even physically eliminated&hellip;Some of the LGBT NGOs have very big support in the media because some people holding key positions in the media and entertainment industry are homosexuals and would want to stop our campaign against inappropriate content.Ezekiel Mutua, CEO, Kenya Film and Classification Board (KFCB), December 2016 Dear Ezekiel Mutua, Moran of the Burning Spear (MBS),Morans, I was taught, don&rsquo;t whine, wail or wallow in self-pity; they instead do something about it. Have you, for instance, reported to the relevant authorities the alleged conspiratorial existential threats you are eager to have us believe have been planned against your person?Shouting &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; for the sole sake of self-promotion or to elicit gratuitous public sympathy will oft-times only be met with disinterested contempt from your audience; I recommend you read Aesop&rsquo;s tale on the shepherd boy who did exactly this for this little bit of enlightenment. Perhaps you should rather focus on why you are now regularly lanced by the sharp pitchfork of public criticism and excoriation.The truth is that your so-called moral crusade is constitutionally infirm. You regrettably have positioned yourself as an overzealous, bigoted crusader for modern-day puritanical, born-again Christian McCarthyism; whose demagoguery harkens to the dark tyranny of KANU-era authoritarian tendencies.Which of these national values has your crusade been in aid of: patriotism, national unity, sharing and devolution of power, the rule of law, democracy and participation of the people, human dignity, equity, social justice, inclusiveness, equality, human rights, non-discrimination and protection of the marginalized, good governance, integrity, transparency, accountability and/or sustainable development?And where in the constitution did you read that homosexuality is illegal? Article 27 guarantees freedom from discrimination while Article 28 protects the right to human dignity for all. Article 32 provides for the freedom of conscience, religion, belief and opinion. A holistic reading of the constitution will lead you to the following epiphany: homosexuality is not illegal.You will also note that no policy, law, regulation or directive can be inconsistent with the constitution. Articles 2 and 3 instruct that, &ldquo;This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic and binds all persons and all State organs at both levels of the government&hellip;Any law, including customary law, that is inconsistent with this Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency, and any act or omission in contravention of this Constitution is invalid&hellip;Every person has an obligation to respect, uphold and defend this constitution.&rdquo;Outside your pernicious attempts to odiously trample underfoot rights that are constitutionally guaranteed, you have been accused of the attempted exercise of a muscularity that is not grounded in law. As your former colleague Macharia Gaitho recently observed:Mr. Mutua&rsquo;s job description comes with clearly defined functions and responsibilities set by the same law that establishes the board he heads. Unfortunately, he has opted to bastardize the institution&hellip;The term &lsquo;film classification&rsquo; is very clear. It is not about exercising pretend powers to ban private parties or enforce prior censorship on films, TV shows, stage plays, advertising, news broadcasts, and even private wedding videos&hellip;Neither is it about prescribing one&rsquo;s own extreme religious Taliban-like moral code on the rest of society.Where do purport to draw power from to, for whatever unconstitutional reason, reportedly ban musicians&rsquo; names, private parties, videos of songs, speed-dating, advertisements and movie streaming? Because as leading constitutional lawyer Wachira Maina pointed out very clearly to you, it is not under the Films and Stage Plays Act, Chapter 222 of the laws of Kenya.Your attempted response to Wachira&rsquo;s critique was legally incompetent for it is not founded even on legal quicksand. First, here is what Section 4(1) of Cap 222 says: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of section 10 of this Act, no film shall be made within Kenya for public exhibition or sale either within or outside Kenya except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a filming license issued by the licensing officer under this Part.&rdquo;Article 3 already clarifies who the licensing officer is: &ldquo;The Minister shall, by notice in the Gazette, appoint a person to be the licensing officer of this Part.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Part&rdquo; being made reference to is PART II &ndash; MAKING OF FILMS.Now, the KFCB is established under PART III &ndash; EXHIBITIONS OF FILMS of the same Act of Parliament and has its functions spelt out via Section 15. Section 15 (1) states: &ldquo;The functions of the Board shall be to &ndash; (a) regulate the creation, broadcasting, possession, distribution and exhibition of films by &ndash; (i) examining every film and every poster submitted under this Act for purposes of classification; (ii) imposing age restriction on viewership; (iii) giving consumer advice, having due regard to the protection of women and children and children against sexual exploitation or degradation in cinematographic films and on the internet; (b) license and issue certificate to distributors and exhibitors.&rdquo;To expand these powers, this section would need to be amended to reflect the new powers sought. Otherwise, all these claims that you make that a task force here or another law there can &ldquo;donate&rdquo; power to the KFCB is a patently illegal attempt to provide expand its clearly-delineated mandate; an unavailing and ultimately futile attempt to clothe with legitimate and legal garb the nudity of KCFB&rsquo;s mission creep. Statutory powers, especially those of regulation, cannot be whimsically &ldquo;donated&rdquo; or dished out as if items of some magnanimity or charity.Hence, before you accuse others of &ldquo;maligning you&rdquo;, kindly check that it is not your conduct that, by its erratically errant nature and character, has maligned you beyond the pale of constitutional and legal redemption.Ngure wa Gachanja is a human rights and democratic governance practitioner.
