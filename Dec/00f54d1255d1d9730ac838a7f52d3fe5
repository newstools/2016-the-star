Kenya&rsquo;s Orthodox boxer Rayton Okwiri has announced that he has quit amateur boxing and will be turning professional next month.The hard-hitting boxer will make his pro-debut at Crown Plaza, Nairobi on January 28 against a Tanzanian boxer to be named soon. Coach David Ottey, who is one of the event organisers, said Okwiri will first fight thrice at home and should he win his bouts, then he will sign a deal with Fox TV to pursue his career internationally.Okwiri&rsquo;s debut fight will be an under-card of the WBA International title contest pitting super-featherweight Nick Otieno &lsquo;Kanyankole&rsquo; against Ghanaian Gabriel Odeyi.Okwiri, who made hit Olympic Games debut last August in Rio, revealed that his local manager Nick Owuor has asked him to prepare for a debut pro-fight, probably in January.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited that the new year will come with lots of good stuff as I take my boxing career to the next level. This is a dream I have been chasing for years and I&rsquo;m glad the opportunity has presented itself at an opportune time. I have always aspired to join the bare-chested game and I&rsquo;m looking forward to my first fight,&rdquo; he said.Okwiri has for the past two years plied his trade as a semi-pro in the AIBA Pro Boxing ranks. The Mombasa native, now a Prisons officer, was alongside two-time Olympian Benson Gicharu and Nickson Abaka signed to the APB competition on three-year contract with the AIBA Boxing Marketing Arm (BMA) to compete in APB.Under APB, Okwiri and his compatriots had a minimum of four guaranteed bouts at an agreed purse ostensibly to maximize their training programs and fight schedule throughout the year with a regular match calendar. Okwiri said the APB had injected lots of professionalism in his career hence his decision to turn pro.&ldquo;Our APB experience was all good as it saw an increase in the number of rounds, providing a chance for the most resilient boxers to succeed, adapt and adjust their skills to comply with the demands of the competition,&rdquo; he said.
