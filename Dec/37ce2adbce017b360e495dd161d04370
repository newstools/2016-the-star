Christmas came early for some sick children in Eldoret as Kenya's top athletes teamed up to give them gifts in hospital.Shoe4Africa and the athletes visited the Eldoret-based Shoe4Africa children's hospital on Friday, and gave out sweets and toys.They cut a cake with the children at the height of the visit by Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and former world 5000m champion Benjamin Lim.Others were former world 800m queen Janeth kosgei and Brittish 1500m runner Charlie Grice.Kipchoge said the visit encouraged the children who could not spend time with their families."I wish you quick recovery," Kipchoge, who won Kenya the second Olympic marathon gold in Rio, told them.Kipchoge noted that most of the diseases the children were suffering from resulted from malnutrition which can be avoided through balanced diets."I have realised that 70 per cent of you here are sick just because of lack of fitness. Fitness in children is brought about by good nutrition and some little exercise. Parents should ensure their children are fit," e added.Jepkosgei said the children were Kenya's future champions and needed support and love."I am happy that this year I also became a mother. I know how it feels when a child is sick. Let us show them love," she said.Shoe4Africa CEO Toby Tanser and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital CEO Wilson Aruasa asked doctors to ending their strike.
