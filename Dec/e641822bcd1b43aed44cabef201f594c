Musalia Mudavadi's Amani National Congress(ANC) has asked the government to stop criminalising civil society activities.Godfrey Osotsi, Amani secretary general, said they read a plot by the current regime to stay in power after 2017 general election, "against the people&rsquo;s wishes".

"We demand that the Jubilee leadership immediately disembarks from this project of disregarding and circumventing the constitution to create primitive, criminal and outdated opportunities," Osotsi said. He said that the government has no permission to block Kenyans from enjoying their constitutional right."We urge the civil society to quickly explore judicial and constitutional ways of fighting for their right to undertake civic education," he said.The Mudavadi party wants the government stopped from frustrating civil society bodies, adding that the groups have been doing a noble and patriotic work.The party further decried the recent shift of the NGO Council from the Ministry of Devolution to the Interior Ministry."This is blackmail and tactics deployed to frustrate and demobilise targeted Civil Society groups," Osotsi said. They likened the Jubilee Administration to past repressive regimes that stifled democracy."It is such tendencies and turning of the Police and other security organs of the state against the population that made Kanu extremely unpopular and led to its rejection and final removal from power," the statement read.
