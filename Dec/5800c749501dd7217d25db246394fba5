Owners of disputed Sh2.4 billion property in Lavington have written to police to protest against the invasion and occupation of their property.Nairobi House Ltd told the Muthangari OCS it leased the seven acres from the government for 999 years. But trespassers have forcibly and illegally taken over the land, the NHL said.&ldquo;My client is aggrieved on the fact that we have previously lodged such similar complaints on trespass, forceful and illegal takeover, malicious damage to the said property and attempted interference with our client&rsquo;s title and occupation of the said parcel of land, but we have never received any positive assistance or response from your office,&rdquo; reads the letter from lawyer Philip Nyachoti.The property is adjacent to Muthangari police station. It has previously been claimed by two firms, Jewel Investments Ltd and Trenton (K) Ltd, associated with Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and businesswoman Lennah Koinange. Courts ruled in favour of NHL.The letter said on several occasions, NHL workers have been stopped by police officers from the station from carrying out any activities on the land,without any explanation.&ldquo;Those officers have always acted in a manner likely to suggest that they are assisting the trespassers in their quest to fraudulently and illegally take over my clients&rsquo; land,&rdquo; Nyachoti said.The lawyer has also petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, the Lands ministry, DPP Keriako Tobiko, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, DCI director Ndegwa Muhoro and CEO of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Halakhe Waqo.&ldquo;We want all relevant government agencies to act accordingly to safeguard my client&rsquo;s proprietary interest from fraudsters and to uphold the Constitution on protection to property,&rdquo; Nyachoti said.
