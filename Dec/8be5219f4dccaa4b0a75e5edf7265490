Amani secretary general Geoffrey Osotsi yesterday hit out at a section of the interim Nairobi branch officials demanding his removal.Branch chairman Newton Wanjala and Embakasi Central secretary Fred Wamalwa on Tuesday accused Osotsi of meddling in the party&rsquo;s grassroots affairs with an intention to impose new leaders. They said Osotsi has been holding meetings in the city, pretending to be educating members on the planned restructuring of the party.But speaking to the Star on the phone, Osotsi said Wanjala and Wamalwa are self-imposed leaders who are not recognised by the party. He said the duo have misplaced fears and are blackmailing the party. &ldquo;These people want to frustrate the plans to strengthen this party. We won&rsquo;t allow a few disgruntled people to derail us&rdquo; he said.
