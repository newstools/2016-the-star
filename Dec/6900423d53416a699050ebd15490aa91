FIA President Jean Todt has supported Kenya&rsquo;s bid to return to the World Rally Championship in 2019.The former Ferrari supremo said Kenya can make it back to the WRC if necessary processes are implemented by the local organisation.Todt said Kenya Motor Sports Federation will have to make a proper presentation to the FIA on what the country&rsquo;s plan to host the event will entail.Addressing a press conference in Nairobi, the former Ferrari supremo revealed Africa is a very key region for the FIA but added the necessary guarantees set by the FIA will have to be met. Among the issues Todt underscored on Kenya were road safety as well as the deviation from the hustle and bustle of public roads to private land rallying.&ldquo;If all the processes are followed we see no reason why Kenya can not make it back to the WRC. So far we are very impressed with the Kenya National Rally Championship as one of the best run events in Africa. But the new standards of rallying must be respected. What was possible back then when events ran on open roads is not possible these days with the population. Rallies must now be organised on closed roads,&ldquo; Todt said.&ldquo;We are happy that the Government of Kenya through President Uhuru Kenyatta has been very supportive of the process but reiterated the process will have to be ongoing,&rdquo; Todt said.Todt advised Kenya to link mobility (which is a prerogative of AA of Kenya) to road racing which is in KMSF&rsquo;s docket.KMSF chairman Phineas Kimathi, who is the driving force of the process, said the initial step towards returning to WRC will be to run the Safari Rally as a round of the FIA African Rally Championship next year after which they will run a WRC candidate event in 2018 hoping to be re-admitted into the world series in the 2019 calendar.Kimathi met with WRC Promoter chief Oliver Ciesla and is understood to have an agreement in principle - based on strong funding and the kind of closed-road, Rift Valley route that would deliver the all-important televisual backdrop.The Safari Rally was one of the WRC&rsquo;s most important events, with many manufacturers rating success in Africa almost as highly as the world title itself.It was dropped from the WRC when government funding dried up after 2002, but has continued as a domestic event since then.Principal Secretary of Sports Richard Ekai admitted the government lacked the financial muscle to support the bid but added it is all possible to pull in the corporate world in meeting the requisite financial obligations.&ldquo;We are committed as a government to seeing this event return to the world series. The benefit is immense as it will showcase Kenya as a tourist destination.&rdquo;
