Nyandarua county has denied spending Sh2 million on a Christmas tree lit in Ol Kalau by governor Daniel Waithaka on Monday.Communications officer Eliud Miring&rsquo;u said only Sh10, 000 was spent on the d&eacute;cor.The allegations of wastage of public resources had caused outrage on social media with the county being accused of opulence.Controversial blogger, Chege Thiari, kicked off the debate after posting on Nyandarua People&rsquo;s Assembly, Facebook page. &ldquo;I am sure that governor Waithaka and his handlers will even send Nyandarua valentine flowers come February 2017,&rdquo; he wrote. Thiari went ahead to comment that the tree is worth Sh2,000,000. Speaking to the Star on phone Tuesday evening, Miring&rsquo;u said he initially thought the issue of Sh2million was a joke being propagated on social media. &ldquo;But they have taken the joke too far. You know it cannot happen and this tree does not carry value beyond 10k(10,000). But there are those among us who will grab any opportunity available to hurl needless insults,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those spreading propaganda about Sh2million are malicious to the extreme.&rdquo; He said the idea for Christmas tree was for the office of the governor to raise a hundred thousand to purchase gifts for the elderly and disadvantaged. Miringu said all the records of the money spent on the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; are available for all to see. He said &ldquo;it is very unfortunate that some political brokers would twist the intent of this good gesture to suit other interests&rdquo; given this is campaign time. Initially, the office of the governor had decorated a cider tree at the Nyandarua county assembly offices&rsquo; gate and had done wiring in readiness to fix the bulbs.The tree is about five meters tall and one and a half foot wide. It was lit outside the assistant county commissioners offices.
