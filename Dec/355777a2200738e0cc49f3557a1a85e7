Pathologists have identified 30 of the 39 people burned in the Naivasha tanker explosion that left 43 people dead on December 10.Nathaniel Kigotho, National Disaster Operation Centre director, said on Thursday that DNA identification was complete and that some bodies had been identified physically."A list will be available and we will leave the results [at Chiromo Mortuary] for families to confirm whether their relatives are among those who have been matched," said Kigotho.He added that families will begin collecting bodies on Friday for burial.Kigotho said the nine other people suffered extensive burns making their identification difficult.He said more DNA samples will be collected as those taken earlier were not helpful.The director urged families to avail themselves for the collection of the samples."The most preferred samples are from biological mothers and siblings," he noted."Where such relatives are not available, people should bring the victims' personal items such as toothbrushes or shaving machines which would help in DNA identification."Read: Why Chiromo is not accepting fathers DNATeams from the DCI's homicide division and government chemists led by chief pathologist Johansen Oduor are undertaking the identification exercise.Kigotho said the DNA results for the GSU officers whose bodies were taken to the Kenyatta University Funeral Home will be taken to the morgue.
