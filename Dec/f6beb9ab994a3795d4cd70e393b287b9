The state should increase the number of police officers deployed on Lake Victoria islands to improve security, Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo said on Sunday.She said the number is small, despite numerous security risks residents face. Odhiambo said most fishermen on the islands suffer a the hands of Uganda cops who confiscate their fish.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that Ugandan police and fishermen have continuously harassed and extorted money from our fishermen. &ldquo;Let the Kenyan government boost security on these islands so our fishermen are safe,&rdquo; she said.Odhiambo spoke when she toured Remba and Mfangano islands in her constituency. She said the areas have remained backward economically due to unfair treatment of residents by Ugandan police.The legislator urged the state to urgently buy patrol boats for police officers so they can carry out proper surveillance around the lake.She was accompanied by Homa Bay county Beach Management Unit chairman Edward Oremo, who said insecurity undermines fishing.
