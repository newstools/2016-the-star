Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has told National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale to keep off county affairs, as his political clout does not match that wielded by governors.He said Duale was elected by less than 3,000 votes and only qualifies to be an MCA. Some of my MCAs were elected with more than 3,000 votes that Duale rode on to Parliament, Rasanga said.He urged Duale to stop talking too much and making false claims that ODM governors are oiling the wheels of corruption by financing party leader Raila Odinga. The county boss told Duale to respect Raila, as they are not equals. Duale had earlier claimed that Raila is financed by ODM governors, who foot all his bills from the county coffers.Rasanga said Duale and Jubilee want to drag Raila s name through the mud to prove to Kenyans that he is not any different from them. Let him tame his mouth and table the evidence of what he is alleging to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for further action, rather than soiling our names for political expediency, he said.Rasanga said he has never given Raila any county cash, as the opposition leader is not a pauper. Rasanga said he has on many occasions turned to Raila for help when he runs out of money. Duale is supposed to be arrested for giving false information to the public, the governor said.
