Cleric Sheikh Juma Ngao (pictured) has said the appointment of Farida Rashid to the Nacada board following his exit is illegal. Ngao said the move is political as Rashid is a die-hard Jubilee supporter. He says the post is meant for a religious leader and should have been given to a Muslim cleric. &ldquo;I have no fight with Farida. I respect her as a Muslim woman from the Coast. But the law says the position should go to a cleric either from the Muslim, Christian or Hindu faith,&rdquo; said Juma Ngao on the phone on Thursday.
