Governor Martin Wambora (pictured, right) and his rival Senator Lenny Kivuti (left) put on a rare show of tolerance of each other during Jamhuri Day celebrations on Monday. Kivuti, who spoke before Wambora, went up to the governor after his speech and gave him a handshake. The two spoke briefly. When Wambora got up to speak, he urged residents to reelect him.
