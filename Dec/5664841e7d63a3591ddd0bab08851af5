South Sudan's opposition leader Riek Machar has blamed President Salva Kiir for the 2013 massacre of about 20,000 people in the capital Juba.The blame game came as the country commenced commemoration of the bloody week that saw the killing of people of the Nuer ethnicity.But Machar said he wanted peace talks revived and that he was committed to them.Machar accused the Juba regime of murdering its people in cold blood following the fighting that occurred on the night of December 15 that year, among members of presidential guards division.He said the "horrendous" act triggered uprisings in Bor, Malakal, Bentiu and all over South Sudan resulting in the split of the SPLM, SPLA, security organs and all public service.The consequence was the formation of the people's resistance movement - SPLM/SPLA(IO), said Machar who doubles up as SPLM's chairman and Commander-in-Chief."Yesterday I listened to President Salva delivering a speech which was totally in sharp contrast to the one he delivered on the same day three years ago, when he declared war in Nyakuron Cultural Centre," he said."This regime has a pattern of committing atrocities in December. In 2011, it committed massacres in Murle, in 2012 it massacred peaceful demonstrators in Wau and Unity state, and in 2014 it massacred its citizens, raped women and castrated boys."The rebel leader, who was also the young nation's First Vice President, said thousands of people from all walks of life joined the SPLM/SPLA (IO) transforming the crisis into a popular struggle against the regime.According to him, they signed an agreement on the resolution of the conflict to end suffering."The people's euphoria for peace was abruptly ended by lack of political will by the regime to implement the agreement, and finally by July, a bloody confrontation [erupted] in the State House," he said.Read: Troops needed to stop 'Rwanda-like genocide' in South Sudan - UNMachar said so far, more than a million Sudanese have sought refuge in neighbouring countries while at least two million were internally displaced.He said the country was watching while a genocide was taking place in Equatoria region, Unity and Western Bah el Ghazal states.But he appealed to the African Union and the International Community to speedily constitute a Hybrid Court of South Sudan to try perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity."As part of our commitment to peace, we call for the revival of the agreement in a political process that will enable the warring parties to engage in a political dialogue to settle the renewed conflict," he added in a statement on Thursday."We want to loudly reiterate that for a very long time SPLM/SPLA(IO) stood on the platform for peace, reconcilliation, healing and forgiveness. For a national dialogue process to succeed, peace must prevail and be accompanied by a process of accountability and justice."Read: US alarmed over 'ethnically motivated' violence in South SudanAlso read: Riek Machar 'under house arrest' in South Africa
