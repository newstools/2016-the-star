Alego-Usonga MP Omondi Muluan wants the health function reverted to the national government to end patient's suffering in the wake of perennial health workers' strike.Muluan said that counties appear not to be ready to handle the sector if the signs of the devolved units' performance on matters health is anything to go by.He said that the problems bedeviling the sector are as a result of the function being transfered without clear guidelines.Muluan spoke when doctors countrywide downed their tools Monday demanding 300 per cent pay raise, deployment and promotions.Read: Talks to end countrywide strike flop as doctors skip Mailu meeting The strike entered the fifth day Friday in the wake of pain, anguish and suffering of Kenyans seeking health care services in public hospitals.The MP, while addressing his constituents at Ulawe Apate village, Muluan asked the national and county governments to dialogue with the doctors to end the stalemate."It was a good thing to devolve the health unity but it's unfortunate that virtually all of our counties were not ready for the transition," Muluan said."We need to find a lasting solution to avert the biting health strike in the country," he said.Muluan supported the assembly committee on health suggestion calling for counties to rescind health services function to the national government for proper management."It is high time this issue be given a second thought by both the governments and all health stakeholders so that Kenyans can get quality health care," he said.Governors have opposed such calls as unconstitutional and only want the national treasury to streamline its system of releasing funds to manage the function.Read: Mvurya rejects calls to revert health to central government
