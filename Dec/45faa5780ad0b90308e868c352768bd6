South African Premier League side, Ajax Cape Town have dropped former Gor Mahia and Tusker midfielder Ali Hassan Abondo.This comes barely eight months after Abondo signed a two-year contract with the PSL side. The club confirmed that play-maker, who is known for his hard shooting and dead ball speciality, left on mutual consent due to injuries and competition in the playing unit that made it difficult for him to break into the first team.During his stint with the club, Abondo played less than five official matches for the cape side, who are currently 9th on the SPL table with 18 points after 15 matches. According to the club&rsquo;s official website, Abondo was released alongside Portuguese striker Joaquim Lupeta, who also failed to make the first team. &ldquo;It is in Abondo&rsquo;s best interest that the club allows him to leave after finding minimal play time due to injuries and competition,&rdquo; head coach Stanley Menzo said.Club chairman Ari Efstathiou thanked the Kenyan international for his stay at the club, and wished him well with his next club.The former Otieno Oyoo alumnus, who hails from Kisumu is one of the most decorated players locally, having featured for Sony, Bandari, Tusker and Gor Mahia, between 2007-2015. He won his maiden KPL title with Sony in 2006 before clinching two more with Tusker and Gor Mahia. Abondo is also known as &ldquo;Teargas&rdquo; following his red card that sparked running battles between Gor and AFC Leopards fans in 2012 derby after his high tackle on Amon Muchiri.
