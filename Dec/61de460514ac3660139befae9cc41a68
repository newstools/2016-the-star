Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua&rsquo;s brother has declared his interest in running for Mathira MP, raising the political temperature in the constituency.Rigathi Gachagua met about 5,000 of his supporters at his Iruri home and told them he is ready to face incumbent Peter Weru at next year&rsquo;s general election.Other aspirants are Julius Mwaniki, Cathy Irungu, Wambura Wamaranga and George Warutere.Rigathi, an ardent supporter of the Nyeri government, said he will run on the Jubilee Party ticket.He said Nyeri has no vocal MP who defends President Uhuru Kenyatta, which he is ready to do.Rigathi urged Uhuru to ensure that the JP Nyeri branch primaries are not supervised by former Mathira MP Ephraim Maina.&ldquo;The President should know that TNA lost many party seats in Nyeri in 2013 since they [the residents] didn&rsquo;t want the leadership of Maina. The same will happen next year if it [the Jubilee Party] will be under Maina&rsquo;s leadership, as we don&rsquo;t have faith in his leadership,&rdquo; he said.Local politician William Wahome said Maina was rejected as a senator in 2013, despite having the TNA ticket. The same will happen in 2017 if he runs for a post, he said.Rigathi said the recent branch elections for officials were held in a private Nyeri golf club instead of being held at a public place because the party is for the people, not private individuals.&ldquo;People will go for different leaders in Nyeri, but we shall not leave the Jubilee Party, we will fight from within. We shall ensure the President gets about 100,000 votes from this constituency,&rdquo; he said.Rigathi&rsquo;s supporters said he has initiated much development in the constituency, including in schools, churches and other social establishments.He was a public administrator and also a personal assistant of Uhuru for seven years.Rigathi&rsquo;s announcement ended speculation as rumour had it that Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe will run for Nyeri governor and Rigathi would be his running mate.
