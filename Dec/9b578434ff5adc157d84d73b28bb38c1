A female bar attendant was seriously injured during the attack," Ogwada said.The second victim of the incident, identified as Oginga Ojungu, was shot dead when he responded to the alarm raised by the bar owner and his worker.The gang made away with cash, electronics and other goods whose value is yet to be established."They fired shots to scare away residents who tried to respond before escaping to Narok," Ogwada said.The bodies were taken to Migori referral hospital mortuary while the woman was admitted to hospital with gunshot wounds.John Odera, a resident, said most criminals between Migori and Narok counties carry cross-border crime to deter investigations."We need police in both counties to share information and help each other in investigations to help in bringing suspects to book," Odera said.Read: New police choppers to help fight crime - NkaisseryAlso read: Boinnet rubbish claims 24,600 crime cases in 2015 involved police
