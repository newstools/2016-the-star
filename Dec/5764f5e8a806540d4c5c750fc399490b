The Luo community in Mombasa has anounced they will not back any governor hopefuls, forcing aspirants back to the drawing board.About 86,000 Luos voted in Mombasa in 2013. Governor Hassan Joho, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and lawyer Annania Mwaboza are jostling for the community&rsquo;s backing.Joho has at one point been bashed for &ldquo;clinging on ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s coat&rdquo; to get the Luo support.Awiti, a Luo, has been meeting with his tribesmen since last year to win their support.Mwaboza, on the other hand, has been looking for a non-native running mate. Sources within his political circle say the community may front an aspirant.But Thursday&rsquo;s announcement by the Mombasa Luo Community spokesperson, Onyony Mwalimu, that they are not keen to support any candidate has disrupted plans.Analysts say hopefuls would have an easy run if they get the bloc&rsquo;s support. Mwalimu said the community is opposed to the six-piece-suit voting pattern. It has been difficult to get quality leaders under this pattern, the community says.It said it voted for ODM in all seats in the 2013 poll.Joho was elected on an ODM ticket, Awiti on Wiper, while Mwaboza is a Jubilee politician. The spokesperson said other parties have good candidates who are worth considering.Other governor aspirants include Suleiman Shahbal (Jubilee) and Senator Hassan Omar (Wiper).&ldquo;With the new rule on party hopping, it is only right that leaders carefully analyse their positions and feel free to vie on other tickets without being seen as traitors,&rdquo; he said.Many able leaders have been locked out during nominations, Mwalimu said.Raila has proposed a joint nomination for Cord governor aspirants in Mombasa, but Awiti and Omar have objected. The Luo community has said it was shortchanged by the county. They raised concerns they have been targeted and only lured back because the polls are months away.
