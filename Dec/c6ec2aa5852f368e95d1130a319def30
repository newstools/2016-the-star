Deputy President William Ruto said yesterday the governmnet is committed to implementing its election pledges and manifesto to improve the lives of Kenyans.He said despite claims by the opposition that Jubilee has not delivered on its promises, the government has proved the &ldquo;doubting Thomases wrong&rdquo;.&ldquo;I told you from the onset that Jubilee would change the history of West Pokot from that of hunger, insecurity and poverty to that of development that you will all be proud of,&rdquo; Ruto said. &ldquo;We promised to solve the problem of marginalisation and insecurity that has been there for 50 years. We are now on the right path in solving these problems.&rdquo;Ruto said the governmnet would use Sh1 billion to expand the Wei Wei irrigation project in Sigor to increase farming activities among the people of Pokot, Turkana and Marakwet.He said development projects will ensure youths are occupied at all times so there would be no room for acts of lawlessness. Ruto said plans to recruit more police reservists to complement the work of security officers along the Turkana-Baringo and Marakwet borders are at an advanced stage.The DP was speaking at his Sugoi home when he hosted a delegation of leaders from West Pokot county, who said they will support the Jubilee Party in next year&rsquo;s general election. The delegation, led by Governor Simon Kachapin, MPs David Pkosing (Pokot South), former Kapenguria MP Julius Murgor, Mark Lomunokol (Kacheliba), Philip Rotino (Sigor), Regina Nyeris (woman rep) and Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), said West Pokot will vote to the last man for Jubilee.Others present were Governor Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), several MCAs led by West Pokot majority leader David Moiben, youths, elders and religious leaders.&ldquo;We want to make our assurance today that as leaders we will do our best to deliver 100 per cent of West Pokot votes to Jubilee when the election time comes,&rdquo; Pkosing said.The leaders said they have decided to work closely with the Jubilee administration because it has started development projects previous governments failed to initiate in the last 50 years. They described Kanu, among other opposition parties, as political outfits which have nothing new to offer Kenyans.
