Boniface Mwangi has built a reputation for high level political activism. In the course of this he has rubbed the political elite the wrong way.It was Mwangi who coined the phrase &ldquo;MPigs&rdquo;.This is a derogatory term referring to elected politicians&rsquo; inconsiderate and greedy lifestyle.For instance, Mwangi was the public face of the demonstration where protesters stormed Parliament and released a pig and about a dozen piglets. They did this to express anger at the newly elected MPs&rsquo; demands for higher salaries.Dubbed &ldquo;Occupy Parliament&rdquo;, the protestors also splattered blood at the main entrance which the animals licked away in total disgust for the members.The unapologetic Mwangi the demonstrators had spilled the blood of the pigs were &ldquo;to show that the MPs are greedy like pigs.&rdquo;&ldquo;Kenya has progressed. What I have done now could not be attempted during former president Daniel Moi&rsquo;s time. I have survived it,&rdquo; he says.Through #TeamCourage project, Mwangi is involved in a campaign which aims at instilling a sense of hope and self-belief in a generation of young change=makers.He however remains worried the 2017 general election is set to open doors for corruption.&ldquo;Activists should organise people to have their eyes fixed on the public coffers because theft is too much,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;We need to see people go to jail, but the current regime has totally failed.&rdquo;Mwangi is now documenting his struggles in a book expected to hit the market soon. He now wants to get into politics and wrestle the Starehe seat from Maina Kamanda&rsquo;s grip.In other words, Mwangi wants to be an MPig, the same title he derides so much.&ldquo;Things that I have been saying should be implemented and when I go to parliament, be prepared for real change, I will be the voice of reason within the house,&rdquo; he saysDoesn&rsquo;t he fear being converted by the remaining MPigs should he win the seat?&ldquo;No. That will never happen,&rdquo; comes the curt reply.His destiny was shaped while growing up in Mombasa. More often he came face to face with atrocities being meted on citizens and he immediately knew his destiny.&ldquo;You must never be fearful about what you are doing as long as it is right,&rdquo; he says referring to his work.&ldquo;I am not an activist; I am an active Kenyan who loves his country,&rdquo; he explains, distancing himself from allegations that he is a gun for hire.
