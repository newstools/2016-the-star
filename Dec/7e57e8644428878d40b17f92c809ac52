Monday has been declared a national day of mourning.Emergency officials said initial information suggested the fuselage was located 27m (89ft) below the surface and 1.7km (one mile) from the shore in the direction of the runway."Divers investigated an object found by sonar and are convinced that it is the body of the crashed plane," Interfax news agency quoted a source as saying.So far only 11 bodies and 154 body parts have been found, but officials believe many more may be trapped inside the remains of the aircraft.Search teams - including 139 divers - worked through the night in three shifts, and the operation "did not stop for a minute", Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said at a briefing on Monday.Read: Russia mourns 92 killed in military plane crash, hunts for black boxThe 10.5 sq km (four square miles) search area just off the coast had been extended, he added.Ten of the bodies and "86 fragments" of bodies have now arrived in Moscow for identification, Major General Konashenkov said later.On Monday, Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said that terrorism was not "among the main versions" of the possible causes of the crash.He reiterated that investigators were looking into whether a pilot error or technical fault may have brought down the aircraft.The minister earlier stressed that it was too early to speculate on possible crash causes.Russian media quoted Aerospace Forces Commander Viktor Bondarev as saying that the plane's black boxes had been located and they were not likely to have been damaged.The plane disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from Sochi's Adler airport at 05:25 (02:25 GMT), heading for Latakia in Syria, the defence ministry said.The flight had originated in Moscow and landed in Sochi for refuelling.It was carrying 64 members of the famed Alexandrov military music ensemble, who were to perform for Russian troops in Syria.An audio recording played on Russian media and said to be of the final conversation between air traffic controllers and the plane reveals no sign of any difficulties.Voices remain calm until the plane disappears and the controllers try in vain to re-establish contact.The plane came into service in 1983.Maj Gen Konashenkov said the aircraft was last serviced in September and had undergone more substantial repairs in December 2014. It had an "experienced" pilot, he said.The defence ministry has published a passenger list (in Russian).As well as the Alexandrov Ensemble, those on board included nine journalists, eight soldiers, two civil servants and eight crew members.Among the victims was Elizaveta Glinka, known as Dr Liza, the executive director of the Fair Aid charity and the inaugural winner of Russia's state prize for achievements in human rights.The Alexandrov Ensemble was scheduled to perform a New Year's concert at Russia's Hmeimim air base near Latakia.Russia has been carrying out air strikes in support of Syrian government forces who are battling rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
