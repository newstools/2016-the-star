Hearing of murder, defilement and assault cases in Embu law courts have halted for lack of doctors to present medical reports as their strike entered the 23rd day.Doctors are needed to table, read and interpret medical reports on injuries to the victims and their treatment. The courts will now wait for the strike to end. This will delay justice for victims.Prosecutors yesterday applied for adjournment of several cases. The countrywide doctors and nurses&rsquo; strike went on for the third day, but the Embu doctors have been boycotting work since November 14.Meanwhile, the strike has seen many patients flock to private hospitals. A spot check at various private facilities revealed long queues of patients seeking services. Kennedy Ochieng&rsquo;, a clinician at Embu Children&rsquo;s Hospital (Tenri) said their wards are full. Doctors demand the government honour a CBA.
