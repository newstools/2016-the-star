The High Court yesterday dismissed claims Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu&rsquo;s academic credentials from India&rsquo;s Punjab University were forged.Judge Joseph Onguto yesterday struck out a suit filed by Waititu&rsquo;s political rival Kiambu Governor William Kabogo. It sought to bar the MP from holding any political office on grounds that he had breached the Leadership and Integrity Act.Onguto said the issues that the governor wanted determined by the court are matters which are not within the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.Kabogo said since Waititu, who has expressed his interest in unseating him, lied about his university degree when he vied for the Kabete parliamentary seat, he is unqualified to vie for any post at the August 2017 election.The governor said Waititu is using academic credentials that belong to Clifford Ndung&rsquo;u.&ldquo;He does not possess any valid university degree and there is no evidence he went through a process of learning, tutoring and examination,&rdquo; Kabogo said.His lawyer Mansour Issa also told the court Waititu committed a fraud when he submitted his self-declaration forms.But Onguto said issues of leadership and integrity are matters that should be dealt with by other institutions which have been given the mandate by the Constitution.The judge said the dispute about Waititu&rsquo;s degree had been dealt with earlier by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and he sees no need to involve the court.&ldquo;The Constitution has placed faith in other institutions which have the mandate to handle issues of leadership and integrity,&rdquo; he said.The hearing of the case was marred by accusations as the two politicians accused each other of fraud.While Kabogo accused Waititu of committing fraud against the people of Kabete, the MP said the governor forged documents from the Kenya National Examinations Council in a desperate attempts to bar him from the 2017 Kiambu governor&rsquo;s race.
