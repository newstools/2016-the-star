The Kitui county driver who ran over former mayor Martha Mwangangi with a fire engine, killing her 12 days ago, once again failed to plead to murder charges.Yesterday was the second time Philip Tito appeared before Kitui resident magistrated Rose Ombata. On December 19, the prosecution said it required time to conclude investigations before he can take a plea.Ombata said since the magistrate&rsquo;s court does not have jurisdiction to hear murder charges, the lower court should grant a date for the accused to take a plea at the High Court, which is currently on recess.Ombata also granted senior prosecution counsel Margaret Matiru&rsquo;s plea to have Tito undertake a psychiatric examination before taking a plea.He fixed the mention of the case for January 12, when the examination report would be filed in court. She said the availability of the report will inform the fixing of the date for taking a plea. Tito is charged with killing Mwangangi and with an intention of wanting to kill Narc leader Charity Kaluki Ngilu on December 15.Ngilu escaped death as Mwangangi was killed by the fire engine during protests by traders in Kitui town.The two had joined the traders who were protesting against demolition of kiosks.
