County commissioner James Kianda has put land cartels in Garissa town on notice following renewed conflicts in which one person was killed and several others injured in Bulla Medina.Two groups, both claiming ownership of a piece of land, fought, leaving the victim critically injured. He was clobbered on the head with a rungu. Mohamed Huseein succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at a private clinic in Garissa town.Addressing the press in Garissa town yesterday, Kianda said the cartels, which are grabbing land near Ring Road, are taking advantage of unsuspecting wananchi.He said the cartels lie that they can register and get ownership documents from the Lands department.Kianda said no land outside Ring Road should be allocated to anyone, and the order is still in force. He urged anyone who wants to acquire land to visit the Lands department at the county offices so that to avoid being conned.Kianda said the national government will not seat back and watch as land speculators and cartels create animosity, which will compromise the security of Kenyans.The county commissioner said the police are investigating and will ensure that those behind the violence are brought to book.&ldquo;As we enter the electioneering period, we will be more alert, given that land is such an emotive issue,&rdquo; he said.Garissa youth leader Hussein Salat during Jamhuri Day celebrations cautioned both the county and national governments not to downplay emerging land conflicts.He said administrators should do more to stop illegal land allocations being carried out by cartels instead of taking sides with their clans.
