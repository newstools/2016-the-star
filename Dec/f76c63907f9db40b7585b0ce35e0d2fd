The Wiper Party has spoken. And it thinks that Kalonzo Musyoka should change his political address to the House on the Hill, effective August 8, 2017.You can&rsquo;t deny a leader of Kalonzo&rsquo;s stature, political acumen and intellect the chance to stake a claim to Kenya&rsquo;s leadership.He has the experience, having been thrown into various political infernos during a career that spans three decades, and has assembled powerful friends and enemies during the time.What are his real chances? He starts off with a solid one-million-vote basket from his native Ukambani that will be projected his way if his name is on the ballot. He is a well-known politician countrywide who requires little or no introduction.Should ODM or Nasa, or whatever other alphabet-soup outfit back him, he will count on the Nyanza vote to a man, and sizeable chunks from Western Kenya, Coast and Nairobi.Kalonzo diehard supporters claim that former President Moi and his son Gideon view him as a safe pair of hands and can deliver enough of the Rift Valley vote as a game plan against Deputy President William Ruto.The Man From Tseikuru can also appeal to his Northeastern neighbours for support, after all he has variously nominated their sons and daughters to top political positions in Wiper.The lawyer has lately developed a firm political spine, as witnessed during the Mashujaa Day fete hosted by his political nemesis and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua.His staunchest supporters say he&rsquo;s the best bet to face JP&rsquo;s President Uhuru Kenyatta, seeing as Raila has failed to clinch the seat twice, despite massive support from across the breadth and width of Kenya. Reason? They claim Kalonzo is more widely perceived as a safe pair of hands.Wiper views their leader as the best bet to slay the corruption dragon in Kenya. He has far fewer graft skeletons, if any, than most other contenders and remains the only top government executive (former and incumbent) to have appointed a Chief of Staff from outside his tribe.His detractors claim that his candidature would be welcome for JP, who would prefer not to face Kalonzo or Mudavadi. Indeed, JP seems to much prefer political chess master Raila Amolo Odinga, whom they consider a serial loser. They say Kalonzo&rsquo;s underbelly would be eroded by the JP team, who famously refer to him as &ldquo;Watermelon Man&rdquo;.
