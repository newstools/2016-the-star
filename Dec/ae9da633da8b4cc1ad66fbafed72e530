Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi yesterday told the Kenya National Highways Authority to compensate Westlands residents before the expansion of Waiyaki Way starts.Speaking while donating car wash machines, boxing gears, sound equipments and pulling carts to Kangemi residents at Kihumbuini Stadium, he criticised the road agency for not coming up with a proper plan to compensate those who will be affected.China Wu Yi Company Ltd was in July awarded a Sh16.4 billion tender for the expansion of Waiyaki Way-Rironi road to a six-lane highway.Wanyonyi said Kenhahas been secretly meeting some landlords and leaving others out.He said some landlords have formed associations purporting to be speaking on behalf of others and are colluding with Kenha to ensure others are not paid."We the leaders speak on behalf of residents. No one else is allowed to do so. Those purporting to be representing you are lying. Simply ignore them," Wanyonyi said.In October, nature and tree lovers criticised the massive felling of trees on Waiyaki Way to allow for expansion of the road.However, City Hall and the police arrested the Kangemi youth who cut down hundreds of trees after it was reported they had no authority to do so.Area MCA Peter Isuha helped raise cash to bailout the arrested youth.
