The National Youth Service cohort programme in Othaya, Nyeri county, will hire 1,000 youths to plant trees at Karima Hills and clean the town, Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki said. The youth will also help in upgrading roads, unclogging water passageways and rehabilitating the Othaya Stadium, she said. Kariuki spoke on Friday as she launched the second phase of the NYS cohort programme in Othaya. She was with area MP Mary Wambui. Kariuki issued Sh19 million cheques to youth and women in the constituency. She cautioned the youth against absenteeism and reporting to duty drunk. “The new phase of the programme will cost the government Sh10 million each month. The first round of this programme will be three months and Sh30 million will have been used to pay the youth,” the CS said. Kariuki added that a portion of the cohort’s wages will be saved for them in the sacco. Wambui said, “I call upon the youth to take advantage of the programme to economically empower themselves.” The MP lauded the government for creating jobs for the youth.
