Khetia&rsquo;s Supermarkets has raised concerns over inconsistent supplies to its stores in Kisumu from resident farms. The Western Kenya-based retailer has called on authorities to help producers build capacity for large scale deliveries.Khetia&rsquo;s says it has invested about Sh300 million in its two outlets in the lakeside city as it seeks a stronger foothold.About Sh200 million has been sunk into Khetia&rsquo;s Dala, with the remainder Sh100 million having been pumped into Khetia&rsquo;s Victoria branch, managing director Ashok Khetia said.The MD has called on the county to empower farmers and suppliers to invest in value addition for their products to meet required standards. The county is endowed with favourable climate and fertile soil for farming, he said. This potential, he added, should be explored to maximise contribution of agriculture value chains to the Kisumu economy.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to import goods from other neighbouring counties if our farmers here embark on serious modern agri-business farming,&rdquo; he said.Kisumu deputy governor Ruth Odinga challenged farmers to take advantage of growing market for fresh produce to commercialise their farm activities, citing rising number of supermarkets.&ldquo;We must wake up and take business seriously if we have to grow economically and financially,&rdquo; she said.Odinga also appealed to investors to expand their enterprises, noting expanding population in the county &ndash; the host of Kenya&rsquo;s third largest city.Khetia said there was opportunity for two more outlets in Kisumu due to its growing population.&ldquo;We are focused on bringing services closer to the people through opening of new stores,&rdquo; he said.Khetia&rsquo;s has nine stores. They include three outlets in Bungoma and two each in Kisumu and Eldoret. The retail chain also has a branch in Kitale and Mumias.
