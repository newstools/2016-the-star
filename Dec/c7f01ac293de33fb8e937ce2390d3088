IEBC has opened a multi-billion technology tender in an ambitious upgrade geared towards correcting the 2013 electoral fiasco that almost plunged the country into anarchy.The bid for the lucrative tender opened as audit giant, KPMG kicked off an audit of the IEBC voter register, triggering an immediate storm with Cord.The audit has been opposed by Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Musalia Mudavadi who have threatened to go to court."this audit should be done after voter registration exercise is over," said Mudavadi in a statement yesterday.The tender advertised yesterday, eight months to the August 8, 2017 polls, seek to correct mistakes of the previous elections that was marred by massive technology failure and allegations of hacking of presidential results.The international tender seeks suppliers for delivery, installation, testing and commissioning of three key electoral equipment that would work in an integrated fashion.These include biometric voter registration (BVR) kits, electronic voter identification (EVID) kits and the result transmission system, known as integrated electronic electoral system.According to tender specifications, the system must have a power autonomy with an internal re-chargeable battery that can supply 12 hours uninterrupted power supply.But besides the internal rechargeable battery, the system must also come with a power bank of at least double the rating capacity of the internal battery.The specification is meant to cushion the electoral agency against possible power blackouts that hit the commission in 2013.The new system would perhaps save the IEBC the embarrassment it faced during the last elections where 31,000 computer based Electronic Voter Identification (EVIDs) kits failed because they ran out of power in remote parts of the country.The setback left only 3,000 hand held gadgets functional.To guard the integrity of the voter register, IEBC says the new system must be able to warn users of violation of set legislative or electoral requirements .For example, the system should be able to reject registration of a person who has not attained 18 years to register as a voter.&ldquo;Where the document used to register a voter is a passport, the passport should be valid otherwise the system should reject,&rdquo;the bid specification states.IEBC also say the new technology must have stringent security measures.For instance, data of registered voters must be encrypted and the system must have full back up, recovery and restore facility.Encryption is the conversion of electronic data into a secret code which cannot be easily understood by anyone except authorised parties.The system, IEBC says, must have the ability to generate reports on polling stations that have not transmitted results at various intervals in all the six elective positions.&ldquo;The system should be able to securely store captured records on internal andexternal media as well...The captured records to be transferred and uploaded to the central database securely,&rdquo;part of the lengthy IEBC tender documents read in part.In a leaked IEBC internal audit of the 2013 polls, the Commission confessed that some BVR kits crashed before data of registered voters were backed up.&ldquo;Some Biometric Voter Registration kits crashed before data was fully backed up. Moreover, no data was recovered from the laptops that were sent to Safran Morpho in Nairobi,&rdquo;the audit noted.Safran Morpho is a French French IT company that supplied the over 15,000 BVR kits used in 2013.But according to the IEBC tender documents, the new systems should be tamper-evident while in a storage configuration either in storage or the polling location.&ldquo;Should have ability to electronically transmit activity logs to central server to enable the audit of electoral officials&rsquo; actions... It should securely transmit the results over telecommunication network to the Commission for consolidation and publication,&rdquo;the documents state.The National Tallying Centre, live transmission of results failed in 2013 forcing a manual count of the votes amid allegations of hacking.The massive system failure provided fodder for lawyers that sought nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta's election in 2013.According to IEBC bid specification, the multi-billion system shall be covered by one years manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty covering all elements of the system hardware, software and parts.In fact, 14-day s to the epic 2017 election, IEBC demands that all requests for repair or replacements in the system must be completed within 24 hours.&ldquo;The vendor must set up a technical support desk at the regional level for providing on-sitesupport at-least 14 days before the general Election and on the polling day,&rdquo; the documents states.Yesterday, KPMG kicked off the audit of the voter register, a process that will end on January 18, 2017.But Cord rubbished the process terming it null and void without the new Commissioners in office.Cord Chief Executive Officer Norman Magaya said they would move to Court on Monday to challenge the process
