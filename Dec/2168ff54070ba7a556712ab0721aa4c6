The Migori County Government is keen to sponsor newly promoted National Super League outfit Isibania FC. Isibania&rsquo;s team manager David Chacha yesterday said the county under the leadership of Governor Okoth Obado has promised to sponsor the club.The county government has also started rehabilitation work at Isibania Kenya Revenue Authority&rsquo;s Customs grounds, the team&rsquo;s home ground, Chacha added.&ldquo;We held talks with county officials who offered to pay allowances for players and cater for transport costs. This will be a major booster to the team,&rdquo; said Chacha when he spoke to the Star.Migori&rsquo;s Public Works minister Moses Kivanda, his Public Administration counterpart Sheila Ghati and sub county administrator Tobias Makabwa launched the rehabilitation works.The rehabilitation works which include leveling the playing surface and planting grass are expected to be concluded on Friday.However, the team may not play their first leg matches at the grounds because the grass may take time to mature and the it lacks a perimeter fence.Chacha however said they would play their first leg matches at Migori Stadium. &ldquo;We have already written to the county requesting to use Migori Stadium in the meantime,&rdquo; he added.The team was promoted to NSL after winning the Division One Zone &ldquo;B&rdquo; losing two matches, drawing two and winning 22. Also promoted was Kibera Black Stars from Division One zone &lsquo;A&rsquo;.Administration Police and GEF 105 would also be promoted if Football Kenya Federation wins the battle to have four teams promoted to the Sportpesa Premier League.
