UDF Presidential aspirant and former DPP Philip Murgor on Wednesday asked police boss Joseph Boinet to provide him with a 24 hour security. In a letter seen by the Star, Murgor stated that his declaration for the country's top seat exposes him to risks and possible life threats.&ldquo;I have received information that my candidature has a specific bearing on the political fortunes of certain powerful individuals in government, who will stop at nothing to frustrate my candidature," Murgor said in the letter.

However you are not entitled to police bodyguards in accordance with the police policy,&rdquo; senior officer K.S Kitoo responded on behalf of Boinet."However having notified that you will be running for president, please be informed that it is the policy of the National Police Service, that all presidential candidates and their running mates will be provided with appropriate security detail throughout the electioneering period, upon presenting their nomination papers to the IEBC and being declared candidates, and until otherwise advised," he added.Murgor responded by saying; &ldquo;In the circumstances, to deny me security whilst availing it to the competition, is to fail to act impartially, as required by the constitution and amounts to abuse of office on your part,&rdquo;Murgor had earlier on declined an officer attached to him for reasons he did not state to the police.Also read; I am confident of winning Speaker seat, says Murgor
