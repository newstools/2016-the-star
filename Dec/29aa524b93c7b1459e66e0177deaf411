President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto should stop taking credit for projects initiated during the Grand Coalition Government, the opposition chief has said.Cord leader Raila Odinga said the projects Jubilee are commissioning were initiated by him as Prime Minister and President Mwai Kibaki.He urged Uhuru and Ruto to show Kenyans the projects they have achieved in their four years in office.Raila accused Uhuru and Ruto of fooling Kenyans on achieving development.The ODM leader spoke yesterday during the Boda Boda Network Forum in Kisumu, where he met more than 1,000 operators.Leaders at the forum included Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, Governor Jack Ranguma, woman representative Rose Nyamunga, MPs Timothy Kajwang&rsquo; (Ruaraka), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Silvance Osele (Kabondo-Kasipul) and Fred Outa (Nyando).Raila said the standard gauge railway and roads were projects of the previous administration and not Jubilee&rsquo;s.Jubilee crippling developmentThe government has failed Kenyans due to massive corruption, high cost of living, poor working conditions and bad leadership, he said.There is no money to fund mega projects due to massive corruption in the government, Raila added.&ldquo;We have seen money being carried in sacks for donation in harambees. Where is the source of such huge amounts of money?&rdquo; he asked.Raila said the government is crippling efforts to fast-track devolution by giving governors inadequate cash.He faulted the government for failing to address the high rate of unemployment. &ldquo;Many qualified youths lack jobs due to failure by the current regime,&rdquo; he said.The Cord leader further accused Uhuru of economic sabotage at the Coast by plans to move the dry port from Mombasa to Naivasha.Raila said the three economic zones created under the Grand Coalition government in Lamu, Mombasa and Kisumu were being shifted to Naivasha, which is only 76km from Nairobi&mdash;Kenya&rsquo;s economic powerhouse.Kenya-singapore pactUnder Vision 2030, the Grand Coalition Government had earmarked the location of every project according to an agreement signed between Kenya and Singapore, he said.Singapore then sent experts who inspected and approved the location of the SGR project, Raila said.He questioned why the Jubilee administration is moving the container ports of Mombasa to inland ports.Raila said opposition regions have suffered economic marginalisation, ethnic discrimination and political oppression for years.&ldquo;The port is moving to a different part of the country through a policy that remains not-too-well disguised to Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.The Jubilee government has failed to set up industries in Western Kenya, which has led to a high rate of unemployment, Raila said.
