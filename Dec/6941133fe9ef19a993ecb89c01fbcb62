As the Nairobi National Park reaches the historical 70 years since being gazetted in December 1946, it's threatened by a proposal to build a railway line through the park. What if it was 2046, the 100th year of the Nairobi National Park? Would it be a moment of great celebration or merely a sober moment of reflection on the sad lost past. The year 2017 will be a very critical year in the park's history, a time when the nation's leaders decide to keep a priceless Kenyan treasure and choose to re-route the railway line outside the park, or Kenya loses their priceless national asset &hellip;Forever! Kenyans and other people who care about Kenya need to declare &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;. A priceless treasure is a treasure that is so valuable and unique that no money or any item of value can replace it. If this current generation does not act now to stop destructive city development within the park and find long-term alternative solutions for roads and railways, then the Nairobi National Park will be reduced to a mere fraction of a &ldquo;green island&rdquo; in an ocean of concrete. God has put many wonderful treasures on this earth. The park is a priceless treasure that needs to be kept for future generations. Concerned citizens and environmental organisations need to take urgent action. Why not make history today? Let's work together now to leave a legacy we can all be proud of, so that future generations can reflect on our actions and thank us for protecting Kenyan heritage! Kenya must decide what the year 2017 will be: A sad loss or a legacy to be proud of?
