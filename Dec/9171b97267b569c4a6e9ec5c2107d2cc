The Court of Appeal yesterday allowed two activists to appeal a decision in which the High Court awarded a company Sh2.8 billion compensation for land in Ruaraka linked to the GSU.The land is intended for the expansion of the Outer Ring Road in Eastlands.Appellate judges Erastus Githinji, Festus Azangalala and Martha Koome said the suit by activists Okiya Omtatah and Wycliffe Gisebe has merit. They say the land belongs to the state.In court documents, the land, which was acquired by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, is said to belong to the GSU headquarters.Omtatah said the 37.4 acres is public land, arguing there is controversy surrounding how Afrison Export Import Ltd and Huelands Ltd &ndash; linked to businessman Francis Mburu &ndash; acquired it.The document says Mburu bought 96 acres in 1981 from Joreth Ltd, now at the junction of Thika Superhighway and Outer Ring Road. He intended to build 600 housing units.Omtatah wants a prohibition order issued to the government through the Attorney General concerning Sh600 million to be released by the Treasury. He says it is criminal to compensate Afrison and Huelands for public land.
