Machakos woman representative Susan Musyoka has told Jubilee to use a digital vote-counting system next year.During a press briefing in Machakos town yesterday, she said there should be no manual backup, because it is prone to manipulation.Musyoka said Jubilee branded itself a digital government in 2013 and it should live up to the billing.&ldquo;We will not accept anything less of a digital election,&rdquo; she said.Musyoka said many problems arose from the manual backup system used in the 2013 election. She criticised Jubilee for pushing for changes to the election rules.&ldquo;It is equivalent to changing the playing field in favour of Jubilee,&rdquo; Musyoka said.She also faulted the government for not resolving the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike which is its third week.Musyoka said the failure to end the strike shows the government does not care about the welfare of citizens.&ldquo;Twenty-one days down the line, the doctors are still on strike. Why has the government not resolved this problem?&rdquo; she said.Musyoka said the number of accidents increase during the festive season and lives could be lost with no doctors to attend to injured people.She said , &ldquo;There is no reason why the government should not pay the doctors their dues because it signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement with the medics in 2013.&rdquo;
