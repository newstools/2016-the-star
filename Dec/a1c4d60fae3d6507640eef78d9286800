With Christmas around the corner, many Nairobi residents are scrambling for public service vehicles to travel upcountry, despite hiked fares.The rush to travel home for Christmas and New Year, the limited vehicles and the price hikes during December recur annually as many city dwellers use the opportunity to reunite with family upcountry.Many Nairobians are also heading to holiday destinations such as Mombasa and Naivasha to celebrate Christmas.Speaking to the Star, Easy Coach operations manager Abied Gilani said those who are travelling are forced to wait two or three days after booking their tickets.Fully booked&ldquo;As per 21st, all travel slots headed to Busia, Bungoma, Kisumu, Migori were fully booked and those coming in to book had to wait until after Christmas if they wanted to travel,&rdquo; he said.Gilani said, however, that the company has not hiked its fares.The Machakos Country Bus Station has also experienced a high turnout of travellers and fares to Kisumu, Western and Kisii at almost double the normal fares.Speaking to the Star, Margret Kamau, a conductor at Machakos Country Bus Station, said they increased the charges as few people are travelling back to Nairobi.&ldquo;Many people are going upcountry but we are really having a hard time as very few people are coming to the city. So we have to adjust the fares to prevent losses,&rdquo; Kamau said.Catching a bus to Kisii, for example, would require one to part with Sh1,000 from the normal Sh500 or Sh600.Mololine, which mostly plies the Molo, Nakuru, Gilgil and Nairobi route, has hiked fares to Sh500 from the usual Sh300.Transline Classic, which normally charges between Sh800 to Sh1,000 from Nairobi to Kisii, is currently charging Sh1,300.&ldquo;I had to part with almost Sh8,000 as ticket fees so as to travel with my family of five upcountry [Kakamega] for Christmas. They later charged me another Sh1,000 for my goods that I&rsquo;m taking with me upcountry,&rdquo; Enock Wanjala said.Some travelling companies hiked their fares as early as mid-December.Regulate bus faresTravellers have urged the government to regulate and standardise fares.&ldquo;This is a free market and the government has previously admitted that they do not have regulations on the amount of fare charged as it is mainly owned by private parties, thus exploiting travellers. The government should address this,&rdquo; said a traveller, who only identified himself as Mwangi.
