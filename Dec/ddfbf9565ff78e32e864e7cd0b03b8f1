Mombasa Trade executive Hamisi Mwaguya has urged politicians to keep off Kongowea after complaints of delays in allocating space at the new retail centre.He told the Star the delays were caused by a disputed list of beneficiaries, which led to fresh vetting to determine the genuine ones.Construction of the stalls was going on as late as last month, despite the retail centre being officially opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta in August.&ldquo;The contractor officially handed over the keys to us only last month. He had to come back and repair the drainage system after heavy rains last month,&rdquo; Mwaguya said.Jubilee politician Suleiman Shahbal had threatened to storm the market on January 2 if the delay continued, insinuating that some county officials wanted to allocate the new stalls to their cronies.&ldquo;There are very strong indications that Governor Hassan Joho intends to allocate the stalls to his cronies and supporters at the expense of the genuine traders,&rdquo; he said.
