Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde believes Shujaa will have to make amends if they are to make it to the Main Cup quarters in Cape Town this weekend in South Africa.Kenya bagged a paltry five points from a lukewarm performance in Dubai over the weekend, winning two matches and losing three matches in the two-day tournament.Kenya were exposed in the kickoffs and breakdown and Amonde said they have four days to polish up the mistakes, which were evident in Dubai. &ldquo;Yes it&rsquo;s a concern we are looking at and it&rsquo;s one weapon other teams used to beat us in Dubai. We must sort it out,&rdquo; added Amonde.Amonde said this being young side, they need to have mental strength. &ldquo;If you look at the matches we lost, they were very close margins. The younger players are learning that the margins of errors are small and one small mistake, can cost you,&rdquo; he added.Amonde said the morale in the team is high despite the dismal performance in Dubai. &ldquo;We sat as a team, talked and reviewed our performance. We can win the matches if we minimise on our mistakes. I expect a more improved performance in Cape Town,&rdquo; he noted.Kenya face Fiji, France and Japan in Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; and will be hoping to replicate the performance from last year, where they reached the semi-finals. Amonde said he was delighted with the performances of debutants Darwin Mukidza and Brian Tanga. &ldquo;They played well and I believe they are slowly adapting to the environment and will be even better in Cape Town&rdquo; he added.On the pooling in Cape Town, Amonde expects a competitive tournament. &ldquo;We played France last week and led 14-0 but failed to put them way in the second half so we have to do better than last time. Japan are a tricky side while Fiji will give us a good game,&rdquo; he said. The team has no injuries to report from Dubai.
