Kisumu deputy police boss Benjollife Munuve has denied claims that people arrested during the Wednesday night crackdown were tortured.He said what the police did was legal and the OCS had the right to undertake special operations.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t harass anybody, there were people who refused to cooperate but we only used justified force not excessive force. This is just the beginning of many crackdowns, expect a more serious crackdown,&rdquo; Munuve said.He said police were cleaning the town ahead of the festivities to ensure the safety of everybody.The officer said it is the responsibility of residents to report any incident that threatens their lives.Kisumu OCS John Thiringiri said no police officer entered any club because they went for the crackdown with a target.&ldquo;We were targeting idlers drinking outside clubs, drunkards misbehaving in public and wine and spirits drinking space and clubs with permits allowing them to sell alcohol up to 11pm but were working past that time,&rdquo; he said.The two officers gave contradicting number of people who had arrested during the crackdown.Munuve said about 50 were arrested and 24 charged, while Thiringiri said about 80 had been arrested and 54 were charged.
