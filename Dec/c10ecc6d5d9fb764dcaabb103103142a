Lake Kenyatta in Lamu county is on the verge of extinction, area residents, experts and fishermen who ply their trade in the water body sounded an alarm on Wednesday.The fishers said that they have experienced a continued reduction in their daily catch for the past months as the lake is drying up at an abnormal rate.Further to this, they said that the receding water levels have raised the risks of hippo attacks as the animals have crowded their fishing spots."Since the lake started drying up, there is only one pond remaining at a certain corner of the lake. The hippos have all moved there," Mohamed Abdalla, a fisherman, said."Unfortunately that is also the only place where there is fish. It means we can&rsquo;t fish anymore since no one dares go closer to that spot for fear of being attacked by the hippos," he said. Most of the fishermen also complained of their boats and fishing vessels being damaged by the marauding hippos at the lake named after Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta.The fishermen also noted with great concern that worms at the lake, which are mostly used as bait, are also becoming nearly extinct."Millions of earthworms which are used as bait by fishermen have already died since the lake began drying up," William Mwangi, a fisherman, said."We are afraid that soon, fishing in this lake will be history," he said, adding that the situation needs to be salvaged before the lake dries up completely.In the last 30 days, over 15 hippos have died at Lake Kenyatta following the prolonged drought that has depleted the lake's water sources.The fishermen appealed to the county and national government among other concerned environment stakeholders to salvage the situation.The lake is the only source of fresh water for the more than 65,000 residents of Mpeketoni and its environs.Simon Komu, director for fisheries in Lamu, said his office was strategising on how to address the situation.Komu said the county had already set aside Sh10 million this year to improve the fishing sector.The experts attributed human activities to the situation that has befallen the once-prestigious water body.Read: 15 hippos die as Lake Kenyatta in Lamu dries up
