Turkana county secretary Peter Eripete has blamed MCAs for stalled and shoddy works on development projects in the county.He claimed that the companies that have performed dismally are associated with a section of the ward representatives from the area.Eripete said on Saturday that the legislators cannot therefore conduct a proper oversight on the progress of the said works since they are party to the same."They have some relationships with either contractors or companies that won tenders to carry out various construction works," the official said.The official said that dispensaries, water boreholes and ECDEs are some of those adversely affected by the said shoddy works.Eripete, while addressing county officials, said the contractors were being paid huge monies yet have delivered very little.He revealed that more than 45 per cent of the county projects had stalled. "We have been complaining that our local people are not given contracts, despite empowering them, they have failed us," Eripete said.He said that the county has embarked on the process of blacklisting entities that have proven to be incompetent to tackle county contracts."Surprisingly, most of these companies are associated with the MCAs. The names of their directors are concealed. If you become hard on them, they go political," the county secretary said.He urged the community to conduct an oversight of projects being implemented within their areas.Read: Bribery, nepotism, tenders lead in county corruption
