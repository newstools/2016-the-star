Kenya is among African countries where access to testing and medication has dramatically reduced prevalence of malaria, a report shows. The World Malaria Report 2016, released by the World Health Organisation, says national surveys from 22 sub-Saharan African countries show approximately half ( 51 per cent) of children under five years with a fever received a malaria diagnostic test in the public sector in 2015, compared to 24 per cent in 2010.The growing access has rapidly reduced malaria infections and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease.The prevalence of malaria in Kenya has dropped from 11 per cent in 2010 to eight per cent in 2015. &ldquo;Ownership of nets at household level has improved, with more than half of Kenyan homes having at least one long-lasting insecticidal net, compared to 40 per cent in 2010,&rdquo; director of medical services Jackson Kioko said early this year, when he launched the 2015 Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey. WHO said children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa have greater access to effective malaria control. WHO&rsquo;s annual report, which tracks progress and trends in malaria control and elimination across the globe, also shows acceleration is needed to remain on track and achieve a number of key 2020 malaria targets.The 2016 report highlights dramatic improvements in diagnostic testing for children and preventive treatment for pregnant women.In 36 African countries, the number of pregnant women who receive intermittent preventive treatment has increased five-fold in the past five years. In addition, WHO data reveals that for the first time, more than half of sub-Saharan Africans ( 57 per cent) sleep under insecticide-treated nets or are protected by indoor residual spraying.Kioko said the Health ministry targets pregnant women at the Coast and Lake Victoria regions by supplying them with preventive medicines during pregnancy.&ldquo;The survey showed 50 per cent of pregnant women in these regions received at least two doses of preventive medicines. This is a two-fold increment compared to 2010 results and shows there is need for additional effort to ensure all pregnant women and their unborn children are protected from malaria,&rdquo; he said.
