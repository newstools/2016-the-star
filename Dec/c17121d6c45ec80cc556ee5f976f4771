Sharp divisions have emerged threatening to scuttle the launch of a Jubilee Party office in Bomet this Sunday.Some party members have accused leaders, whom they did not identify, of locking them out and running the party without consulting them.Led by Patrick Rotich and Monica Taputany, the members said , &ldquo;Some few elected leaders had begun assuming positions in the party, contrary to theaffirmation by the top leadership.&rdquo; &ldquo;As members of this party, we are worried because some few leaders met and came up with a list of officials without our involvement which is wrong,&rdquo; Rotich said. He warned that should the leaders fail to listen and redraft the list, they will ensure the event doesn&rsquo;t take place.Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has announced he will open a Chama Cha Mashinani party offi ce in Sotik on the same day. Governor aspirant Julius Kones, who will face National Assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso for the Jubilee ticket, said he was not consulted. He said this could be a scheme to lock him out of the party.
