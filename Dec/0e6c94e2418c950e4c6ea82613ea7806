The construction of the Sh350 million High Court project in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua, will start immediately, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. He said the building, which will house at least three judges and magistrates’ courts, will take 18 months to complete and will be operational by the end of 2018. The CJ spoke on Friday at Ol Kalou town, where he paid a courtesy call on Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka. Maraga toured the county to “see where there is need for court premises”. He said the greatest need in Nyandarua is a Land and Environmental judge and the judiciary will consider posting one by February, he said.
