Kenya should not withdraw from the International Criminal Court as the 2017 poll will present several "candidates" for it, Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong'are has said.Mong'are said the dropping of President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto's cases did not eliminate the possibility of other politicians being dragged to the court."Uhuru and Ruto should not worry because they have left the ICC. Going by the statements and demeanor of politicians who have said they will reject the results, I see more candidates for the ICC," he said."I warn the President and his ilk to rethink that decision. As we head to 2017 I see more ICC candidates from both Cord and Jubilee."Read: Raila won't complain of rigging againAlso read: Is ODM planning to reject 2017 election results?Mong'are further noted that rising political temperatures, sparked by the ICC withdrawal debate, were an indication the country could be headed to a deadly post-election aftermath.He said the Jubilee administration's move to pull Kenya out of the court, alongside several African countries, was ill-advised and ill-timed.In his address to the press at Parliament Buildings on Thursday, the Senator also asked fellow opposition leaders to desist from issuing remarks that could breach peace.Mong'are added that politicians in the Cord coalition should commit to a peaceful election. He said opposition leader Raila Odinga asked MPs not to sign documents during a governance summit in Kwale county, "signalling bad intentions.""All over the world the opposition can only take power in a free and fair election, not through a bungled process. Raila should tell Kenyans why he did not sign a pledge to peace agreement spearheaded by Kepsa," he said.Regarding the acceptance of poll results, he asked: "When you say you will not accept results does it mean you will use the other means?"After skipping the governance summit organised by Kepsa, Raila was accused of plotting violence during the August 8, 2017 general election.Kwale woman representative Zainab Chizuga said Raila's team may be planning to plunge the country into violence.Chidzuga said the public should shun the leaders who did not attend the Kepsa summit that discussed cohesion and peace ahead of the general election.&ldquo;We are worried, as women and children of this country, if Raila can boycott a summit to discuss peace issues ahead," she said."He might be planning to get people, especially at the Coast, to the Kaya Bombo time, when our people were killed."[Statement]: Raila snubs Kepsa summit, cites bias for Jubilee[VIDEO] Uhuru signs Mkenya Daima peace pledge, assures credible 2017The 2017 general election has been billed by analysts as the most bitterly contested presidential election ever, pitting the ruling Jubilee alliance against a credible opposition challenger.Raila, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi of the Amani National Congress sealed the deal to form the National Super Alliance to remove Uhuru from power.But Jubilee troops claimed on Wednesday that Raila was working with unnamed Western powers to get power through unconstitutional means.The 20 MPs, led by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, turned the heat on the opposition chief, saying his penchant for a shortcut to power was the "reason he doesn&rsquo;t accept election results".&ldquo;He and his foreign masters aspire to take Kenya to uncharted darkness of chaos and undemocratic takeover, institutional sabotage and constitutional overthrow,&rdquo; they said in a statement read by Duale.Read: Jubilee turns heat on Raila over ICC, dismisses foreign allies, Nasa
