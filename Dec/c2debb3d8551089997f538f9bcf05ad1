Attempts to sabotage the Sh9 billion African Development Bank-funded projects along the Thika River will be met with the full force of the law, the deputy county commissioner has said.Christopher Wanjau spoke on Friday at the intake of the Yatta Canal during the launch of public training on sustainable water management and irrigation. The training is being carried out by African Research and Economic Development Consultants.&ldquo;Government will not condone people who want to drag petty politics into these projects. The projects are important to the livelihoods of the people and we cannot allow them to be compromised at whatever cost,&rdquo; Wanjau warned.The AfDB has financed the rehabilitation of the Yatta Canal for Sh2 billion and given another Sh7 billion towards construction of Yatta Dam. The two projects along the Thika River are supervised by the Tanathi Water Services Board.TWSB chief manager for corporate affairs Daudi Kitonga said more than Sh600 million has been paid in compensation to residents relocated to make room for the dam.&ldquo;The projects will turn around the living standards of residents of Kiambu, Kitui and Machakos counties. It is thus ill-advised for people with political interests to turn the projects to a political issue,&rdquo; he said. Kitonga said before the collapse of the Yatta Canal, 16 per cent of fresh produce Kenya exported in the 1980s and 1990s came from the area. &ldquo;The aim of these projects is to see a return to that impressive state of affairs,&rdquo; he said.
