Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho is daydreaming if he thinks the Jubilee Party will not win any seat at the Coast, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro said yesterday.The ODM rebel MP, who is heading the JP campaign team at the Coast, told Joho to prepare for a tough battle in the elections.Mung&rsquo;aro was responding to Joho&rsquo;s remarks on Sunday that all the six Coast counties are opposition strongholds and any leader who decamps to JP will lose the elections.In a phone interview, the former Coast Parliamentary Group chairman told Joho to prepare to lose as they will &ldquo;enter Mombasa in a big way&rdquo;.&ldquo;Joho does not own Coast. He doesn&rsquo;t have the votes of the people in his pockets, so he should not think Coast people will be in the opposition for life,&rdquo; he said. Joho and President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have been at loggerheads over the Coast vote.Mung&rsquo;aro, former ODM minority chief whip, and the Mombasa governor are locked in a supremacy battle for the region&rsquo;s leadership.The legislator said JP will ensure Coast residents are not only in government next year, but they will have a key stake as decision making.&ldquo;We are not going to encourage our people to vote for the opposition. If people go for elections, they always aim to form the government. People do not go for elections to be in the opposition,&rdquo; Mung&rsquo;aro said.He said Joho&rsquo;s remark that Coast residents will vote for the opposition is a clear indication Uhuru will be reelected.Mung&rsquo;aro said ODM did not develop the Coast when it was in the grand coalition government. He said the ministries of Land, Water, Roads, Agriculture, Public Service, Immigration, Industrialisation, all headed by ODM MPs, never helped the coastal people.
