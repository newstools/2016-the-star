Florence Kiplagat will target her own world record at the eDreams Barcelona Half Marathon when she lines up for the IAAF Silver Label Road Race on February 12.The 29-year-old Kenyan has twice broken the world record at the event, clocking 1:05:12 in 2014 and then taking three seconds off that mark in 2015. She added a third consecutive victory in 2016, running a season&rsquo;s best of 1:09:19.Kiplagat went on to finish third at this year&rsquo;s London Marathon before winning the Chicago Marathon in a season&rsquo;s best of 2:21:32.Elsewhere, Kenyan-born Turk Kaan Kigen Ozbilen starts favourite in the Madrid&rsquo;s San Silvestre Vallecana 10km road race tonight after winning the last two editions.The 30-year-old, formerly known as Mike Kigen, is in fine form, having clocked a marathon PB of 2:06:10 earlier this year and more recently finishing 10th at the European Cross Country Championships in Chia three weeks ago. The three Spaniards, who finished ahead of him on that occasion will also be in the race on Saturday, but Kigen is a renowned road specialist and his knowledge of the circuit might be an advantage over his rivals.Yet, the most experienced athlete in the field by far will be 2006 European 5000m champion Jes&uacute;s Espa&ntilde;a. Now aged 38, he finished runner-up at this race 15 years ago and at the 2014 edition.The women&rsquo;s cast is headed by Kenya&rsquo;s Brigid Chepcheshire Kosgei. Still relatively unheralded, she boasts a marathon PB of 2:24:45, set when finishing second in Lisbon in October, but her most recent outing was a 2:31:11 victory at the Honolulu Marathon less than three weeks ago, which might hamper her winning chances here.France&rsquo;s Liv Westphal will be trying to take advantage of any sign of weakness from the Kenyan. The European under-23 5000m champion, currently a student at Boston College, recently finished ninth at the European Cross Country Championships.Karolina Nadolska (nee Jarzynska) could also be a factor tonight. Holder of the 31:43.51 Polish 10,000m record, she was sixth in the Manchester road race in late November while her last outing came in Porto where she was second in 33:15 over 10km.Local hopes to make the podium rest on 2010 European 1500m champion Nuria Fernandez, now 40, and marathon specialist Alessandra Aguilar.Forecasters predict a cold night on Saturday with temperatures ranging between 4-6 C by the time the gun goes for the last IAAF Label Road Race of 2016.In addition to the elite contest, there will be a mass race with no fewer than 40,000 entrants taking to the streets two-and-a-half hours before the main event.
