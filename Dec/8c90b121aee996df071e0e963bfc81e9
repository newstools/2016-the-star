A law firm associated with Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen failed to show proof that it bought Sh15 million land in Eldoret on behalf of Out of the Box Solutions.Hillary Sigei, the managing partner of Sing&rsquo;oei, Murkomen and Sigei Advocates, said he cannot produce a land evaluation report and the purchase agreement.The crucial documents, which could confirm such a hefty transaction, were not produced before the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday.Out of the Box solutions is associated with former media personality Angela Angwenyi and is said to have irregularly won a Sh302 million tender with the Ministry of Devolution.The firm paid Murkomen&rsquo;s firm Sh15 million which they told the public watchdog committee was payments for purchase of the said piece of land.The senator skipped the session and instead asked the committee, led by Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, to show Kenyans that they are not using the privileges of their position to influence the probe."I have challenged Gumbo and the PAC team to give confidence to Kenyans that they are not raising campaign money through their privileged position as MPs," he said."...let them publish the account details of the committee members to show that they are clean...," Murkomen said at a media briefing in Marakwet on Thursday.Read: Waiguru links Duale, Farouk, Murkomen to NYSAlso read: Kimaiyo slams Murkomen over 'shameful' defence in NYS scamMore on this: Murkomen paid me over a debt, not NYS kickback, Kindiki saysHowever, it has been unable to table even a legal fee invoice note to prove that Out of the Box Solutions formally contracted it for legal services.During Thursday's session, an evasive Sigei dwelt in a legal combat ammunition saying sharing the information would be in breach of advocate-client confidentiality.He took the committee on a wild goose chase for over four hours, a situation that irked some of the members, resulting into heated verbal exchanges.But Sigei remained adamant that the law firm is not under legal obligation to table documents that contravene regulations that govern the practice of advocates."As to why the client bought the property, the value of the property and the agreement between our client and the seller, these are not questions that an advocate should be asked to answer," Sigei told the committee.He told MPs that they should have directed the line of questioning to Angela Angwenyi, the director of Out of the Box Solutions, when she appeared before them earlier."Please note that as an advocate, when we received the funds, we did not receive from or on behalf of NYS but rather from a client with specific instruction to purchase a property," he said.In regard to providing bank statements for the law firm from March 2013 to date, Sigei told the committee: "such an indiscriminate action serves to embarrass our innocent clients and injure their good reputations."He asked the committee to write to the law firm with specific request for information on the firms or persons who is the client of the law firm and currently under investigation."What we are against is for the committee to use our firm as a Guinea Pig or for fishing expedition," he said."The politicisation of this process only serves to undermine our legal practice and legal business. The ultimate result is economic sabotage and hurt legitimate business," Sigei said.He went on: "The manner in which the committee is proceeding is serving to scare our clients from doing legitimate business with us."Sigei added that the firm's constitutional right to privacy is not going to be observed and that the advocate-client confidentiality is going to be disregarded in the event the information is disclosed.Infuriated members vowed to sanction the law firm for refusing to produce documents as requested by the committee.
