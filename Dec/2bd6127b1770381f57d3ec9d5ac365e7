Two ODM MPs have sounded an alarm of a plot to auction a Sh3.96 billion mall constructed at the Lake Basin Development Authority headquarters in Kisumu.Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Fred Outa (Nyando) claimed on Friday that the mall's ownership is being transferred to &ldquo;well-connected individuals within the Jubilee administration&rdquo;.The leaders said the 'high level interest' in the 60,000 metre square mall is the reason for 'a deliberate delay' in the handing over of the project to LBDA.More on this: LBDA director told me to stop query on cash &ndash; SavulaWandayi and Outa termed the plan as 'yet another scandal of the Jubilee Administration' and accused the Devolution ministry of being used in the execution of the plot.Furthermore, they said that the delays has seen the project accrue Sh145 million interest to Cooperative Bank &ndash; the projects' financier &ndash; per day.They asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to immediately intervene on the matter so as to safeguard the public interest on the multi-billion project situated at Mamboleo junction on Kisumu-Kakamega highway."Unfortunately, as the circus continues, taxpayers continue to lose heavily since the project is accumulating interest at the staggering rate of Sh145 million per day, over and above the principal amount," Wandayi, also ODM political affairs secretary, said.However, sources at the bank said the interest grows at the rate of Sh1.5 million per day and not as claimed by the legislators.Wandayi said they are wondering why the Devolution ministry is still spending more time in the pretext of seeking advise from the Attorney General instead of advising the National Treasury to pay Cooperative Bank and the contractors so that the project can be handed over."The government's technical team had given the project a clean bill of health. We wonder why the oversight ministry is not keen to put the mall in use so that the users reap its economic benefits," the Ugunja MP said.He said the stand off comes at a time tenants have booked more than 70 per cent of the mall space.Tuskys Supermarkets is the anchor tenant and has reserved space to open its second outlet in Kisumu.Outa said the Devolution ministry must be held to account on why it is procrastinating the handing over of the project."The delay is further aimed at perpetuating the economic marginalisation of the communities living in Western Kenya. Once the property lands in private hands, the public will be deprived of the immense opportunities of employment and attendant benefits," Outa said.The leaders cited the Thursday reopening of Pan Paper Mills in Webuye &ndash; now known as Rai Paper &ndash; as one of the many schemes to have key factories and enterprises in the region controlled by 'powerful forces' in government.Read: ODM MPs want Uhuru to declare personal interest in Pan Paper MillsLBDA was earmarked as the implementing authority of the project when it was conceived in 1978.The venture was later abandoned in 1982 on what was blamed on political reasons following the failed coup plot targeting to overthrow Moi's government.It was revisited in 1992 but stalled yet again; the construction was revamped in 2013 and was completed in August having been certified by the department of public works.Also read: LDBA to put up Sh2.5 billion mallA multi-agency committee, comprised of officers from the AG&rsquo;s office, the Treasury, Ministry of Devolution and Planning, Department of Public Works and office of the Auditor General, also okayed the project.When contacted, LBDA acting managing director Evans Atera, through the parastatal's communication department, said they were surprised to hear of such claims.Atera said that they do not have any official information regarding the hand-over to private managers."What we know is that we have signed a tenancy with Tuskys Supermarket &ndash; the anchor tenant &ndash; who have already started fixing their shelves in readiness to open a branch at the mall," Atera said.The mall, which is at the confluence of Migosi, Lolwe, Nyawita, Riat, Kanyakwar and Mamboleo estates, has space for a supermarket, 3-Star hotel, car showrooms, tyre centre and recreational park.A source privy to the ongoings dismissed the allegation that the project is being auctioned, citing that the property, being owned by a parastatal, cannot be handed over to a private entity."It will take a deliberation of the full cabinet for such a decision to be reached. The project was built on a built-operate-transfer module and cannot be auctioned in any way," the source told the Star.
