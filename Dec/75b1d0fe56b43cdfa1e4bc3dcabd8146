Adults in Nyanza should not damage his chance to become President or let down their leaders by failing to vote, Cord leader Raila Odinga has said.It will be meaningless for aspirants to jostle for posts after investing heavily in their campaigns if there are no voters, he said.His third presidential bid will be useless if his staunch supporters only talk about wanting him to ascend to power, but don&rsquo;t vote, Raila added.&ldquo;I have held the tail of the leopard and would like everyone to turn out with their voting weapons to support me in killing it before I suffer its bruises,&rdquo; he said. Get vote cardsThe ODM leader said 400,000 residents from his home county Siaya have ID cards but have not registered to vote.He urged all elected leaders and aspirants to comb villages in Nyanza and help residents to register to vote.Raila spoke in Siaya on Saturday.The opposition chief said the 2017 election battle will be won by the number of voters each coalition&rsquo;s strongholds has registered.Raila was with his wife Ida Odinga, Siaya and Kisumu Deputy Governors, Ouma Onyango and Ruth Odinga, respectively, and MPs Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem), James Nyikal (Seme), Tom Kajwang&rsquo; (Ruaraka) and Oburu Oginga (nominated). Tough presidential raceThe Cord leader said that if Jubilee is given another chance to rule for five years, the rampant corruption will get worse and MPs will have no national funds to develop their constituencies.&ldquo;I should not be asking MPs, governors and senators to support my bid to kick out Jubilee government after it has failed in virtually everything in governing the country,&rdquo; he said.The ODM leader added that Nyanza region seats will be filled by sons and daughters from that region.Campaigns for those posts will not be as tiresome as those of the presidential contest, he said.Raila urged Cord leaders locked in the war of words with their competitors not to be distracted, but focus on strategies that will ensure Cord forms the next government.&ldquo;I want to beg voters and Cord leaders to divert their energy on formulating strategies that will see Cord form the next government,&rdquo; he said.
