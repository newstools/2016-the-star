In a season where there was quite frankly no noticeably standout player,the 2016 &ldquo;Footballer of the Year&rdquo; was bound to be a surprising choice.And what a big surprise it was when Western Stima rookie forward Kenneth Muguna was crowned the &ldquo;Sportpesa Footballer of the Year&rdquo;.The fleet footed attacker in what was his first campaign in the top flight league held off the challenge of seasoned campaigners and household names like Tusker title winning duo of midfielder Humphrey Mieno and goalkeper David Okello,Ulinzi Stars and KPL golden boot winner John Makwata as well as the most promising player of the campaign,Gor Mahia left back Eric Ouma.&rdquo;This is an amazing honour for me in my first year in the league.I never expected it this early in my career. I&rsquo;m glad because of the guidance of my coach (Henry Omino) and the support from my team-mates,family and above all God&rsquo;s blessings I was able to pull it off. This award motivates me to continue working hard so that I can achieve my goals as a footballer,&rdquo; said Muguna.The individual honour now marks Muguna as the hottest property in Kenyan football with him revealing that a host of clubs including AFC Leopards and champions Tusker are hot on his trail.The 20-year old also won the &ldquo;Midfielder of the Year&rdquo; award and came second in the &ldquo;New Player of the Year&rdquo; category, feats which brought his total prize money collected to a whopping Sh1.6million, plus two flat-screen televisions as well as an LG K10 smart phone courtesy of event partners LG Electronics.The tone for the final hurrah was set early on when Posta Rangers duo of goalkeeper Patrick Matasi and defender Joakins Atudo upset the odds to emerge victorious in their categories.Matasi pipped last year&rsquo;s winner Boniface Oluoch and title winning goalkeeper David Okello, bagging second and third positions respectively. Atudo saw off Gor Mahia centre half Musa Mohammed and free kick master Noah Abich of Sofapaka.As expected Tusker&rsquo;s Ugandan, Paul Nkata, won the Coach of the Year award, beating contenders Marcelo Ferreira to second place and Francis Baraza, third.AWARD WINNERSMost Valuable PlayerKenneth MugunaCoach of the YearPaul Nkata (Tusker)Marcelo Ferreira (Gor Mahia)Francis Baraza (Chemelil Sugar)Golden BootJohn Makwata (Ulinzi Stars)Kepha Aswani (AFC Leopards)Wycliffe Ochomo (Muhoroni Youth)Golden GlovePatrick Matasi (Posta Rangers)Boniface Oluoch (Gor Mahia)David Okello (Tusker)Defender of the YearJoackins Atudo (Posta Rangers)Musa Mohamed (Gor Mahia)Noah Abich (Sofapaka)Midfielder of the YearKenneth Muguna (Western Stima)Whyvonne Isuza (Mathare United)Humphrey Mieno (Tusker)Fair play Player of the YearAli Bai (Kakamega Homeboyz)Jared Obwoge (Chemelil Sugar)Amos Asembeka (Sony Sugar)New Player of the YearEric Ouma (Gor Mahia)Kenneth Muguna (Western Stima)Cavin Odongo (Posta Rangers)Team Manager of the YearGeorge Opondo (Tusker)David Mwangi (Ulinzi Stars)Pascal Ochieng (Posta Rangers)Fair Play Team of the YearKakamega HomeboyzMathare UnitedWestern StimaAssistant Referee of the YearGilbert CheruiyotStephen OduorMary Ann NjorogeReferee of the YearAnthony OgwayoDavies OmwenoBadr Yassin
