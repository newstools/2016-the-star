Mumias West MP Johnson Naicca yesterday said he will ensure his constituents get justice following the recent operation by GSU officers to recover seven rifles and 184 bullets that were stolen from Booker police post.He told the Star he will meet the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights officials to discuss the brutality meted out on residents by the officers.Last week on Tuesday, thugs raided the Booker police post and stole the weapons. They also injured the sole police officer who was manning the station. Following the raid, police ransacked homes and businesses. Residents complained that police beat and tortured them. They also claimed GSU officers raped women. We will know our next course of action after the meeting. We have clips as evidence of police brutality and destruction of property. This forms part of evidence in addition to injuries the victims suffered, Naicca said.
