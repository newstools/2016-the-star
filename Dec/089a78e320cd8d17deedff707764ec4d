National Olympic Committee&ndash;Kenya first vice chairman Bernard Ekumbo is opposed to a bid by the prosecution to try him jointly with three other senior Noc-k officials.Yesterday, the prosecution was expected to consolidate Ekumbo&rsquo;s case with that of Noc-k secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul, vice-chairman Pius Ochieng and assistant treasurer Stephen arap Soi but told court they were not ready.State lawyer Duncan Ondimu said the prosecution was going to prepare a fresh charge sheet to merge the two files.But Ekumbo through his lawyer Cliff Ombeta said he will be opposing the move by the prosecution to have the trials merged since the circumstances of the cases are different.&ldquo;There is no way the cases against the accused can be merged together since the details are different Ombeta said. The lawyer was of the view since witnesses in the case against Ekumbo are different from the witnesses being lined up by the prosecution in the case against the other Noc-k officials, then the matters should be handled separately.&ldquo;Ekumbo was arrested two months after the others, the place of arrest is different, exhibits are different and charges are also different&rdquo; the lawyer said.Ekumbo was arrested on November 21, and is out on a cash bail of Sh200,000.Though he is being investigated over allegations of child molestation at the Kenya Swimming Federation, he has already denied charges of stealing money and sports kits intended for the team at the Rio Olympic Games.He is accused of stealing Sh1m ($10,500) and the uniforms but he has denied the allegations.Ochieng, Kinyili and Soi are accused of stealing Sh25million and kit meant for athletes.The officials were arrested on their return from Rio at the end of August over their roles in the alleged mismanagement of the Kenyan team's preparations for the Games.Noc-k was disbanded on August 25 by Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario following public pressure. The CS&rsquo;s decision however has been challenged in court and the matter is still pending.
