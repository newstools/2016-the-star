Residents of Naisunyai village in Samburu East subcounty have raised Sh11.5 million from selling 465 out of 500 livestock meant for the Lmuget cultural celebration. They will use the money to build classrooms in the only primary school in the village. Naisunyai Primary School is inside the Westgate conservancy.Livestock are usually donated by the community for slaughter to celebrate the transitioning of morans [warriors] into elders during the Lmuget ceremony. But this time, only 35 goats were slaughtered for the feast.Lmuget was celebrated on Monday and elders said prayers at the Naisunyai school compound. The elders cleansed the school to drive out evil spirits that might be derailing its development.Naisunyai Primary School Parents&rsquo; Association chairman Mark Lalampa yesterday said, &ldquo;The school has never been developed. The buildings you see were built in 1984. The school has never produced KCPE candidates.&rdquo; He said parents transfer their children to better-equipped schools when they reach standard four. Lalampa said the school lacks teachers and basic amenities, including toilets. He urged businesspeople to contribute cash to build more classrooms and a dormitory.Resident Paul Lolming&rsquo;ani praised the community for the initiative and urged others to follow suit by directing funds for Lmuget towards development.&ldquo;This is a unique move we have made and we hope other villages will emulate us,&rdquo; he said.Early this year, residents and parents protested against the lack of facilities at Naisunyai Primary School.The role of morans is important in the Samburu community. They provide security and defend the community against invasions by cattle rustlers. Traditionally, hundreds of cattle are slaughtered during Lmuget.
