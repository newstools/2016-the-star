ICT CS Joe Mucheru has told senators paperwork is the best manual backup option that would guarantee a clean voters&rsquo; register at the 2017 election.Appearing before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, the CS said while the ministry supports an electronic electoral system, the voters&rsquo; register backup must be manual.Mucheru, himself an ICT expert, said technology all over the world often fails, hence the need to have a physical paper copy as the best alternative fallback.He said overreliance on technology in a country with network reliability of about 90 per cent means up to 2.5 million Kenyans would be disfranchised on Election Day.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to have a paper copy of the cleaned and verified register. It will be identical to the original electronic register to ensure it is a clean copy. It&rsquo;s not a register in itself but a backup,&rdquo; Mucheru said.The CS told senators the current tender for the procurement of the Kenya Integrated Election Management System by the IEBC would have to be reviewed to allow a manual backup.&ldquo;The existing tender is based on the existing laws, which do not take into account the manual backup,&rdquo; he said.
