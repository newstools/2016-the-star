Former minister Chris Murungaru was considered a primary hurdle to President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s fight against corruption, a court heard yesterday.Contents of a transcribed recording showed that former PS Stanley Murage told his Ethics counterpart John Githongo that Murungaru ought to be relieved of his ministerial post over the Anglo Leasing scandal as he would have cost the government so much if retained.Investigations carried out by different government agencies at the time also revealed that top government officials, among them Murungaru, were listed as those who ensured the Anglo Leasing scandal happened.However, in the reports by the investigative agencies, he was not listed as a suspect, Githongo said.Githongo, who was defending himself in a defamation case against him, said it became apparent to the government that its top officials knew about the scandal, especially after some of them phoned the shadowy figures behind the scam and money was wired back to the state.At that time, he said, the Central bank of Kenya gave evidence that Sh1 billion was wired back to the state coffers. This was money received from different corrupt deals, which were being investigated, among them the Anglo Leasing scandal, he told the court.&ldquo;If senior officials could pick up a phone and call &lsquo;Anglo Leasing&rsquo; and money is wired back, then it meant our people knew,&rdquo; Githongo said.He said he was under pressure to conduct investigations and nail the culprits.&ldquo;I was under pressure from the President to find out who was behind Anglo Leasing and who was paid the money. When Finance and Justice ministers asked me to drop the matter, I was perplexed,&rdquo; he said. Githongo will give his testimony again on February 15.
