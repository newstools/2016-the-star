Education CS Fred Matiang'i failed to rank schools and candidates in this year's national exams despite MPs passing the law.Former CS Jacob Kaimenyi banned ranking, saying it created unnecessary competition and encouraged cheating.But on Thursday Matiang'i said, "There is no basis to do ranking of students and schools as at now."He said the ministry did not manage to work in time on a method of ranking students or schools&rsquo; performances.Parliament passed law in August 2016 reverting to school and candidate ranking in national exams.He said once the ministry presents the recommendation before Parliament and it gets necessary approval, the ministry would avail a ranking list of schools and students in 2016 KCPE.State to pay exam feeMatiang'i further said from 2017 the government will be paying examination fees for all candidates both in private and public schools.In January, Sh2.9 billion was paid to the Kenya National Examination Council for exam fees for 906,429 KCPE candidates and 519,607 KCSE candidates in 2015 national examinations.More on this: State to pay KCPE, KCSE exam fee for 1.4 million candidatesTo curb cheating, Matiang'i said private candidates will have to write their tests from centres approved by the Education ministry."Some private schools have been registering two centres in one school. We will never again have private centres where people do exams behind shops," he said.He said the schools present one centre with 21 students adding "so that their mean can go up. That nonsense will end today.""You cannot use our children for your own gains; in a selfish, greedy way. One child will grow up with the stigma that people think they are not smart," he said.Form one selections Matiang'i said pupils who score over 400 marks will be able to join national schools of their choice whether from public or private.He said form one selection begins immediately and that letters of admission would be given to students before December 25."We want to make sure parents celebrate Christmas knowing where their children are going," he said.The CS said selection process to join form one will be finalised by December 9.Matiang'i thanked teachers and parents for their cooperation during the exam period."I hope moving forward, we will build on these results in what we do. Our focus moving forward will be about what we are going to do with head teachers," he said. "I am very grateful for the cooperation of my sister Nancy Macharia and the TSC. I am seeing a very interesting cooperation across the board."He said the ministry does not want to teach children at an early age that they can take short cuts and reap where they have not sowed."Last year, as a responsible public servant I tendered an apology for the mess we were in of cheating and canceling exams. That time I said that I did not wish to apologise again," he said.Read: Sossion shocked as Matiang'i releases KCPE results todayAlso read: KCPE cheating: Wajir teachers texted answers from bushes - Matiang'i
