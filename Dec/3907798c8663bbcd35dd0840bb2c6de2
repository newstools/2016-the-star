Some politicians have received Sh4 million to disrupt a rally during which the Luhya presidential candidate will be unveiled, Francis Atwoli has claimed.Atwoli, who is Cotu secretary general, warned Rashid Mohamed and Stanley Livondo against attending the meeting set for December 31 in Kakamega town.He told journalists in his office on Wednesday that the two will face residents' wrath if they do not keep off."I am not a politician. Neither am I in any party politics. I'm only discharging my duties as an elder. I am therefore warning those two fellows not to take my politeness for weakness," said the Cotu boss."I am daring them to make good their threat and come to Muliro Gardens that day. The rally is legally permitted therefore they will be dealt with by the government and if that fails, Luhyas themselves will be waiting for them."Read: Plans to name Luhya presidential candidate on December 31 underway - AtwoliAlso read: Atwoli to name Luhya presidentialcandidate in MarchFurther claiming that a "powerful individual" was behind the plan, Atwoli told any politician seeking Luhya's votes to "talk to the community nicely" and "in a polite manner"."On this day we are going to name the most popular presidential candidate in Western Kenya, this person will lead the way and show Luhyas the direction. He will decide to go it alone or work with like-minded parties to clinch the presidency next year," he said.Livondo told the Star by phone that he had not taken any money to disrupt the meeting.He asked Atwoli to listen to other leaders instead of making moves on his own."I respect [him] as a trade unionist but we are not going to allow ourselves to be misled as a community," he said.Organisers of the meeting told the Star that all leaders from Western and other regions will attend."We are anxiously waiting for the day. We will start streaming to the field as early as 6am to hear from Baba Atwoli. Whatever he will say we will follow," said a local leader who did not want to be named.Also read: Luhya leaders for joint rallies, one candidate
