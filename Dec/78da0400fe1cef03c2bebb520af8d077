Kenya Electricity Generating Company has finally injected about half of the 844 megawatts it had planned to add to the national grid by September under the ambitious 5,000MW project, the managing director Albert Mugo has said.The sluggish delivery, he said, has partly been caused by obstacles in sourcing financing. Mugo cited the two-year delay in floating a rights issue at the Nairobi Securities Exchange, which targeted to raise Sh28.8 billion for building new power plants. The cash call openedsuccessfully in May, raising Sh26.5 billion.The KenGen boss said they have revised their target to 720MW, which will be injected into the grid by 2022. I think KenGen is the only company that has so far contributed the most power in the 5,000MW plan. We are doing the best we can to hit the target, he said in an interview on Wednesday on the sidelines of the company s annual general meeting.Kenya estimates it will need some extra 15,000MW by 2030. The government launched the 5,000MW power plan in September 2013 to expand the country s generation capacity from about 1,664MW to more than 5,000MW in 2017. It hopes to achieve this by diversifying energy sources from hydro and thermal to geothermal, wind and solar.KenGen is the anchor investor in the project, which is expected to lower tariff s and cut the cost of doing business.About 2,492MW that was to be developed through independent power producers is yet to come through.So far, KenGen has commissioned a 230MW geothermal project in Olkaria, and 25.5MW wind project in Ngong.It is also set to break ground for its Olkaria V geothermal power project next month, adding 100 megawatts to the grid.Mugo said the Sh36.8 billion project is in its final stages of tendering. If we start the project in January it means it will be ready by the end of 2018, he said. He said the Ngong wind power project will also be upgraded by adding five more turbines, each generating 2MW.The wind power project funded by the Belgian and Spain governments has 30 installed turbines. The electricity generator received a $1 million (Sh101.86 million) grant from the United States Trade and Development Agency for the feasibility study for solar power generation. Other projects lined up for completion by 2020 include Olkaria VI 140MW, Olkaria VII 140MW, Olkaria I Unit 6 70MW, Wellheads 25MW, Olkaria I Rehabilitation 5.7MW, Olkaria I AU and IV topping plant 60MW.
