Business sentiment in November dropped, a monthly survey by Standard Chartered Bank and US research firm MNI suggested yesterday, contradicting a similar report released by Stanbic Bank on Monday.The Standard Chartered MNI Business Sentiment Indicator fell to 57.5 in November from 61.3 in October, marking the second lowest reading for 2016 after a 57.0 low in February. This is despite November being the peak season for demand and production ahead of the festive season. &ldquo;The fall in sentiment fits our view on the Kenyan economy (because) weaker credit growth and demand, and potentially higher input prices have been taking their toll on business activity,&rdquo; StanChart's chief economist for Africa Razia Khan said in a statement. This contradicted Purchasing Managers' Index survey by Stanbic Bank and IHS Markit which indicated that private sector activity rose to 53.3 from a four-month low of 52.0 in October. The StanChart's MNI Business Sentiment showed that firms were worried about a challenging lending environment and a rise in input prices with fears of price increments in the coming months.Sentiments fell across five components including new orders, production, order backlogs, employment and supplier delivery times. New orders, which denote domestic demand, fell to 63.9 while export orders fell below the break-even level of 50. The fall in the two indicators resulted in a drop in both production and employment indicators.Although firms paid lower interest rates in November, they raised concerns about accessibility of credit following the implementation of the Banking Amendment Act in September. The law capped bank lending rates at 400 basis points above the Central Bank Rate, presently at 10 per centThe current conditions for interest rates indicator dipped 24 per cent month-on-month to a series low of 36.5, with future expectations indicator rising sharply to 39.5 from 19.9 in October. This is, however, below the break-even level of 50 , suggesting that most firms expect rates to fall further or remain low in the coming months.
