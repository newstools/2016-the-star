Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya (pictured) has alleged sugar barons are importing cheap sugar from Brazil and repackaging it in Mumias Sugar Company before reselling it. He on Thursday said the sales from the imported sugar is used to finance election campaigns by the Jubilee administration. &ldquo;Jubilee has frustrated the revival of the company. It has written off debts for the coffee and dairy sectors, but has ignored the sugar industry, because it&rsquo;s their political cash cow,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;Mumias will never get back on its feet as long as the political shenanigans by senior government functionaries to enrich themselves at the expense of farmers remain in place.&rdquo; But company head of corporate affairs manager Moses Mukhwana dismissed Oparanya&rsquo;s claims as &ldquo;mere political statements that have no basis&rdquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not doing that and we will not do that as a corporate entity, because that is not part of our mandate,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone on Friday. Mukhwana said the company is on a steady recovery and will soon return to normalcy. The government has given Sh3.2 billion to the firm in four years. But Oparanya said the company is down with huge debts that attracts more than Sh400 million interest annually. Immediate former Mumias company board chair Dam Ameyo said a fortnight ago that the company was grappling with debts amounting to Sh11 billion in bank loans. Oparanya said the county is not to blame for the trouble at Mumias. He said he was fought politically when his government tried to assist the company by disbursing Sh200 million to assist pay farmers.
