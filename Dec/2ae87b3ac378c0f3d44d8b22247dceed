Two Coast leaders allied to the Jubilee Party have accused the opposition of planning to cause chaos in 2017 after skipping the Kepsa peace summit.They are Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro. On Friday Chidzuga said, We are worried as women and children of this country if Odinga can boycott a summit to discuss peace issues ahead of 2017, we don t know what he might be planning. She said that Kwale was one of the most affected regions during the 2007-08 post-election violence. This led to many job losses. This must be avoided at all costs in 2017, Chidzuga said.Mung aro said the hotel industry at the Coast suffered after violence. If your village is meeting to discuss peace and you decide not to go, that means you arenot peaceful, he said.
