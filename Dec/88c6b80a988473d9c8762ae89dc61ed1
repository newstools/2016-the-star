Police shot and killed a 43-year old man after he allegedly attacked them in Kanduyi, Bungoma South, on Friday morning.Sylas Waswa was shot several times in the leg, neck and chest at Ndengelwa village, where police had gone to evict people following a court order.Waswa's brother Cleophas Wanjala said he had rushed from his house to the scene of the demolitions when he was killed.His widow Sylvia Nanjala said he was going to lock up their goats when the officers attacked him, ordering him to life down.Nanjala said he defied the order and was pushed around and then killed in the hail of bullets while trying to run away.Human rights activists in the county, led by Philip Wekesa, condemned police for the killing saying the man did nothing wrong.''We want IG Joseph Boinnet to intervene and have the officers responsible arrested and prosecuted for the heinous act," said Wekesa.He noted that police had the option of arresting Waswa since he was not a threat as he was unarmed.But the officers insisted the man was dangerous; they claimed he threatened to kill them after accusing them of taking a bribe to evict him.The tussle concerns a property estimated to be about three acres large. Waswa's step-mother obtained a court order to evict him and his three brothers claiming they grabbed it from her.The officers demolished four houses on the property but the case is still being handled by the courts.Waswa's body was taken to Bungoma County Referral Hospital morgue.Read: [AUDIO] Businessman calls Sonko 'dog' in confrontation over demolished Westlands houseAlso read: Cabinet freezes renewal of land leases, orders Nkaissery to arrest fraudsters
