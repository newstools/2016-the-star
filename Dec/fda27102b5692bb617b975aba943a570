A Nairobi court on Thursday withdrew forgery and fraud charges against businessman Mohan Galot and his wife Santoshi Galot.Chief magistrate Daniel Ogembo made the decision at the Milimani law court after the complainants said they did not wish to pursue the matter.The charges were preferred against the couple by their nephews, Pravin Galot and Rajesh Galot, who complained they had forged signatures of public officers in the Ministry of Lands.The two claimed that their uncle also forged signatures of registrar of companies to transfer three prime properties to MG Park Ltd without the consent of the other directors of Galot Industries, including Pravin and Rajesh.Ogembo acquitted them noting that the parties in the case were members of the same family. He also said they were other matters pending at the High Court to determine the shareholders and directors of Galot Industries.They were facing eight counts of forgery and fraud and were each released on Sh500,000 bail in May 2014.The two are fighting their nephews for the control of a multi-billion-shilling business empire.There are three pending civil suits awaiting determination which similarly arose from their status as shareholders and directors of five international companies.Read: Trader sues for Sh5bn
