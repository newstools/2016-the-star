Health services in Nakuru remained paralysed for the second week after nurses failed to reach an agreement with the county government.This was after talks between the county and Nakuru branch Kenya National Union of Nurses bore no fruit on Friday.During the negotiations, the two parties maintained their hard-line stances on the issues that occasioned the health workers' strike.While a taskforce formed by Governor Kinuthia Mbugua maintained the nurses end their strike ahead of the talks, the latter said they will not accept to be taken for a ride."The union must call off the strike before any negotiations can be held," Waithanji Mutiti, Nakuru county public service board chairman, said.The decision was rejected by industrial relations officers Dismus Kigen and David Omulama - who represented the union alongside branch secretary Syprine Odera.Read: Nurses end strike after deal with governors, CBA talks set for JanuaryAlso read: Deal inked, strike ends, nurses back to work, doctors still out"The more than 1,200 nurses who have downed their tools will only return to work after the county government heeds to their demands," Omulama said after the meeting.He said that it was a mockery of the highest order for the county government of Nakuru to demand that the nurses return to work before any negotiations can take place."We are more than willing to engage the county government at any time. But for now, our members will remain out of their work stations until their demands are met," he said.The nurses want the county to effect their promotions, pay outstanding salary arrears and create a system where they can be re-deployed to various stations.The stand-off now leaves Nakuru and Taita Taveta as the only counties where nurses are yet to return to work after the nationwide strike was called off on Wednesday.
