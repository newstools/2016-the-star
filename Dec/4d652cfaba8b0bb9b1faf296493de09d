This wedding is a good example for other youths to follow," the MP said.He urged youths and village elders from the region to preach peaceful messages amongst them for mutual co-existence with their neighbours."We want peace so that we can move forward in development like other Kenyans. I would like to urge elders and youths to continue with peace initiatives," the legislator said.Agnes Lesingito, a resident, said: "This kind of wedding has been accepted for the first time. We should therefore unite and shun hatred among ourselves, now that we are in-laws,"Many leaders across the country have been encouraging their constituents to marry from other communities to end tribal hate.Most recently, President Uhuru Kenyatta's son, Jomo, got married to Fiona Achola - the late Odongo Omamo's granddaughter - in a Kikuyu traditional wedding.Read: Intermarriages for social cohesion: Wairimu, my Kikuyu wifeAlso read: Kamanda tells Kikuyus to marry from other tribes
