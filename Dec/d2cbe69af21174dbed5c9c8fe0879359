President Uhuru Kenyatta has dismissed the proposed national super alliance (NASA) as a tribal outfit with no agenda for the country.Uhuru on Thursday slammed at the opposition leaders as only busy engaging in propaganda and tribal politics.He added that the lot has failed to show Kenyans what they will do in case they take over management of the country after the 2017 poll.Speaking at Pan Paper Mills when he reopened the factory, Uhuru asked Kenyans to shun politicians whose agenda is to divide them on tribal lines."These people who call themselves leaders have no agenda to Kenyans. What they only know is to abuse me and my government and incite Kenyans to violence," he said.The president told the opposition leader Raila Odinga to appreciate what Jubilee had done for the last three years.Proponents of the super alliance plan to bring together opposition politicians notably Raila, Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as well as Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula among others.Read: Uhuru allies anxious over Super AllianceAlso read: 'Power hungry' NASA leaders have no agenda for Kenyans - UhuruMore on this: Uhuru phones Gideon to stay away from NASA"We have done a lot since we assumed office but other people still keep on inciting Kenyans that we have done nothing," Uhuru said.Uhuru defended his administration as free of tribalism, adding that but it has accommodated all Kenyans regardless of their communities of origin or religion."They are saying Jubilee is tribal because they are not in government. When you are not in my government, that does not mean that the whole of your tribe is not there," he said.He blamed tribal politics on the collapse of Pan Paper Mills -now known as Rai Paper - and other industries in the country, further asking Opposition leaders to put politics aside and join him in fighting poverty and unemployment.Accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, Uhuru said Jubilee government had created more jobs for youths by reviving collapsed industries and connecting many rural homes to the national electricity grid.Ruto thanked the president for reopening the factory saying it will not only assist Bungoma people but also the neighbouring counties from the 500 jobs expected.''People have been lying to you that Pan Paper will not roar back to life. Let them know that we have opened one line and they should come and see," he said.The president said the other line will be opened in June 2017 from which 350 jobs are expected to be created, and also improve the economies of Western residents."Many big businesses which used to be here were shut down after the collapse of this factory. Now that it is back, Webuye will be the town we used to know 11years ago," Ruto said.He also promised that the former factory workers will be paid by the government for three months as they try to settle."The former employees will be paid regardless of whether they have been recalled or not. Families of those who had died will benefit," Uhuru said.He said that the government will also revive Rift Valley Textiles (Rivatex) in Eldoret as away of creating more job opportunities.Ruto said they were now sure of getting votes in the region following the numerous projects initiated in the area compared to the 2013 general election."Although you didn't vote for us, we have ensured that we empower this region with several mega projects. We urge you to vote for us this time round," he said.He said the those in the opposition had nothing to region while they were in power and have no moral standing to critic Jubilee's development record.
