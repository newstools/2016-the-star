The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has opened investigations against a senior official in the Kilifi government.But even with this new development, documents seen by the Star show efforts to scuttle a case against Matano Riziki. He is the head of supply chain management.Riziki faces four counts of soliciting a bribe. Last year he obtained temporary orders stopping his trial. But a year later Justice Said Chitembwe dismissed Riziki&rsquo;s application to quash his prosecution.However, after the decision, the complainant, Stephen Sanga Barawa, filed an affidavit withdrawing the complaint.On August 24, 2016 Barawa wrote to Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko, asking to withdraw the complaint and the discontinuation of the case before a Malindi court.On November 23, Barawa filed an application seeking to quash the proceedings and asking that he should not be compelled to testify in the case.Barawa said it would be unfair for the case to proceed before his aplication is heard. He said a plan to compel him to testify is malicious and contravenes his rights. He said he was not compromised.It has now emerged that while the case against Riziki was pending, he made irregular payments to companies in 2015.The documents, seen by the Star, show that Matano influenced and manipulated the payment of Sh160 million to two firms.The payments were made to Grandtop Solution and Mediscope Agencies. Grandtop was paid for a contract to upgrade a county data centre and cyber room. Mediscope was paid for supply of treated mosquito nets.Documents show double payments to Grandtop of Sh17,448,274.1, broken down into Sh8,724,135.05 paid on July 1, 2015 and Sh8,724,137.05 on September 29, 2015.
