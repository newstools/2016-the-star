The trial of five people charged with cold-blooded murders of lawyer Willy Kimani, his client and a taxi driver is set for a marathon hearing in February next year.On Monday, trial judge justice Jessie Lesiit directed the trial of AP officers Fredrick Leliman, Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku and Peter Kamau to resume on February 13. It will be heard to conclusion without skipping a day.The five have denied killing Willy, Josephat Mwendwa and Joseph Muiruri on the night of June 23 at Soweto, Machakos.Already, two witnesses, one of who is on the witness protection programme have testified.The prosecution at the beginning informed court that they intend to call 60 witnesses to prove their case against the five.Kimani and the two men had attended a case at Mavoko law courts on June 23 when they were abducted and taken to Syokimau Ap&rsquo;s camp.Their bodies were later found dumped in Oldonyo Sabuk River stashed in gunny bags.Some of the key witnesses in the high-profile trial who are on protection programme are yet to give their testimonies.The prosecution, Law Society of Kenya, the International Justice Mission and families of the deceased recently put up a spirited fight to have the five not released on bail pending trial saying they were still afraid , the accused would interfere with witnesses and evidence.The high court a fortnight ago declined to release the five on bail saying it could be in the best interest of justice that they remain in custody at the moment.The prosecution claims the four hatched a plot to kill Kimani, Mwenda and Muiruri to conceal evidence in another case.The plan in which two of the suspects and another man who is still at large are alleged to have orchestrated the plot a day before at a hotel in Mlolongo.
