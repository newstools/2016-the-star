The state should consider granting amnesty to graft suspects who agree to drop their election bids and don't seek appointments, the National Council of Churches of Kenya has said.Corrupt deals have tainted Kenya, while the suspects are not dealt with properly, it said.Perpetrators usually rush to court and obtain orders stopping investigations, and thus graft cases thrives, NCCK secretary general Canon Peter Karanja said.Speaking at Jumuiya Conference Home in Limuru on Wednesday, he urged the public, religious leaders and government officials to come up with "redemptive strategies" of dealing with current and past corruption.&ldquo;We recommend that the perpetrators of corruption be considered for amnesty from prosecution on condition that they be barred from seeking elective or appointive public offices,&rdquo; Karanja said.He was with NCCK national chairperson Canon Rosemary Mbogo, when they attended the group's annual general meeting.Karanja expressed fear that Kenyans are losing faith in the government as it seems to have lost war on graft.The NCCK was shocked when President Uhuru Kenyatta asked senior government officials what he was expected to do to eradicate corruption, the cleric said.He said they resolved to urge the President to dissolve the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission as it was not delivering its mandate.The secretary general recommended a directorate be established in the Office of teh President to deal with investigations and prosecution of corruption cases so that the executive arm can take responsibility on graft cases.&ldquo;In so doing, the current and future Presidents will never have an excuse not to deal conclusively with corruption, which will otherwise bring the country to its knees,&rdquo; Karanja said.The cleric urged worshippers not to ask for cash to vote for individuals who want to run for election.
