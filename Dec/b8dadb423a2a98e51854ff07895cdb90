Just because President Uhuru Kenyatta has not visited you in two years does not mean he hates you, Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has told residents. The last time Uhuru was in Embu was on December 7, 2014, when he attended the ordination of Anglican Church of Kenya Diocese Bishop David Muriithi.The residents have been grumbling that Uhuru has visited all neighbouring counties but bypassed them. A week ago the President visited Nyeri, Murang&rsquo;a and Kirinyaga.Their restlessness has been heightened by the fact that in August Uhuru visited their neighbours but again bypassed them. This despite the county voting for him overwhelmingly in the March 4, 2013, general election.On Saturday a JP delegation from Nthawa ward complained to Kivuti at his Kanyuambora residence. He told them the President might visit soon. &ldquo;I was with the Deputy President the other day, who told me that President Uhuru Kenyatta might be coming to visit you before the end of December to commission some of the development projects being undertaken by the national government,&rdquo; he said. A number of visits have been cancelled since 2014. The most recent was August 6, when Uhuru was supposed to preside over a harambee for Kangaru High School. He sent Deputy President William Ruto instead. Kivuti has announced he will run for governor. He will face incumbent Martin Wambora, World Bank development projects consultant Kithinji Kiragu, former PS Cyrus Njiru, psychiatrist Njagih Kumantha and the most recent entrant, entrepreneur Leonard Muriuki. Kivuti told the residents who visited him not to harbour ill feelings against Uhuru. He said Uhuru loves them, evidenced by the many ongoing major national government-funded projects, which he will launch soon.
