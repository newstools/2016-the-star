A man has gone to court seeking to remove Health Cabinet Secretary Cleophas Mailu from office over the Sh5.3 billion queries. The ministry later said Sh3.2 billion is being queried.Francis Sakwa also wants PS Nicholas Muraguri to step aside. In a suit filed before judge Edward Mureithi, he said it is unconstitutional for the two to continue being in office, as this is against the principles of governance and leadership. The continuous occupation of office of the two sets a dangerous precedent and stand out as dangerous rodents eating at the very roots of the rule of law that ought to be safeguarded by the Constitution, Sakwa said.He said all Kenyans are responsible for the implementation and execution of the Constitution.Sakwa said he has taken the initiative on behalf of Kenyans, who don t tolerate corruption.He said there is real danger hovering over the ministry and unless the court intervenes, investigations will be interfered with. There is urgent need for this court to move with speed as a custodian of the Constitution by prohibiting the further occupation of office by Mailu and Muraguri, Sakwa said.The Attorney General is the first respondent in the suit, while Mailu and Muraguri are the second and third respondents.Sakwa said detectives moved to Afya House on October 26 to probe claims of possible loss of money for critical programmes such as the free maternity scheme, so the two should step aside.Sakwa said more money could have been lost in the possible scam which the two want to cover up by manipulating the Integrated Financial Management Information System. It is just and equitable that this application be heard and determined on priority basis, he said.
