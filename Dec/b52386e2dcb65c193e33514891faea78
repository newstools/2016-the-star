Rapper Kanye West visited Trump Tower on Tuesday morning but it was not clear if he would meet with President-elect Donald Trump. West arrived with a small entourage, but his wife, businesswoman Kim Kardashian, was not with him. Transition team officials were not immediately available to confirm that the rapper and the Republican president-elect would meet. West was hospitalized for exhaustion last month after a series of rants and the cancellation of the remainder of his U.S. tour. The 39-year-old rapper made headlines in November when he was booed at his San Jose, California, concert for declaring his support for Trump.
