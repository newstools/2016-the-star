DP William Ruto is grappling with how to prevent a major falling out among Nandi political leaders, each scheming to outdo each other at events attended by the DP.There are fears the split and stiff competition could hurt Jubilee&rsquo;s performance next year. All but one county MP last Sunday boycotted an interdenominational fundraiser hosted by Governor Cleophas Lagat. It was attended by Ruto at Kurgung, near the home of the county boss.Lagat and MPs are sharply divided over his performance, but he says the criticism and enmity are pure politics. &ldquo;Some are interested in the position of governor. They&rsquo;re entitled to run but they don&rsquo;t have to downplay my achievements,&rdquo; he said.Only Mosop MP Kirwa Bitok attended the function because it was in his constituency, but he is also not in the governor&rsquo;s good books.Conspicuously absent were Senator Stephen Sang, woman representative Zipporah Kering and MPs Cornelly Serem (Aldai), Julius Melly (Tinderet), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) and Alex Kosgey (Emgwen).Earlier, Sang, who is considering running for governor, and MPs Serem and Melly joined Ruto at Bonjoge for another function. Sang is the governor&rsquo;s harshest critic.They declined to board choppers made available to take them to the Lagat event. They apparently feared youths were hired to heckle them because they oppose the governor.Sources said Ruto is worried about the split. During the event, he said he will not favour any of them during JP nominations. He met some of them later to discuss the rift.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no preferred candidates and you, the people, will choose your own leaders,&rdquo; the DP said. Jubilee and Cord are both under pressure to award direct ticket, but that would demonstrate that nominations were not free and fair.
