Irate residents of Takaye in Malindi subcounty on Thursday demolished a perimeter wall at a disputed land. They then marched to the deputy county commissioner&rsquo;s office to demand an explanation about the land ownership. The residents say the land belongs to them and had been grabbed by an elderly man. They added that the man has the support of a popular Malindi businessman. They burnt tyres at the site, blocking the road while singing songs of justice. Others carried twigs, while others brought down the wall which was yet to be completed. At the commissioner&rsquo;s office entrance, security personnel blocked them from enterring. Malindi subcounty AP commander Augustine Mwongela and MP Willy Mtengo told them to choose five representatives who would meet with the authorities. Mwongela told the demonstrators the issue would be resolved through following the law and that chaos and demonstrations were not the way to go.
