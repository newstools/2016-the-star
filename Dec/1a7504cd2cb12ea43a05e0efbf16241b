Meru Catholic Diocese bishop Salesius Mugambi has banned politicians from campaigning in churches, and instead told them to address voters outside church after service.He said the church is a place of worship and must not be turned into campaign grounds. Mugambi spoke yesterday on the sidelines of the Year of Mercy celebrations at Consolata Primary School in Meru town. He urged politicians to respect the church.&ldquo;If they are given a chance to greet the people and sell their agenda, let them do it outside the house of God. These houses are blessed and meant for prayer. Priests need to take care of that. A lot of things have happened in the past and we don&rsquo;t want to go back there,&rdquo; Mugambi said. He expressed concern politicians have resorted to physical fights and use abusive language. Mugambi urged them to be tolerant and respect each other.
