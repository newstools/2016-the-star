A number of MPs have sensationally claimed a close senior relative of a top leader in the Executive arm of government and a commercial bank gave money to MPs to dilute the NYS probe report.But the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has denied the allegation.When asked about the claims, PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo said: &ldquo;You must understand this scandal touches a lot of people, some of whom hold positions of influence. There&rsquo;s nothing they would love more than to make the committee look bad. I am sure if you challenge those fraudsters to give you evidence, they will simply duck&rdquo;.While most of the MPs spoke on condition of anonymity, Suba MP John Mbadi spoke openly about how the investigation may not yield findings that can be used to identify and prosecute the culprits.&ldquo;We know an uncle to one of the members of the Executive who secretly met a few members of the committee and money changed hands. We also know a bank that has compromised some of the officials,&rdquo; said Mbadi in an interview with the Star.The Suba MP alleged that Ben Gethi, who is widely mentioned in the NYS heist, was used by a close relative of one of the Executive officials.&ldquo;Ben Gethi was a conduit used to steal from NYS, but we have the documents as well as we have traced the real beneficiaries of the NYS funds. He is not alone but the names are many and point to specific individuals,&rdquo; said Mbadi.There have been unconfirmed allegations that Gethi adversely implicated the uncle of a top government leader in his testimony to MPs that was given in camera.Prior to his appearance before the PAC, Gethi had asked for protection, claiming he had received death threats.Mbadi said the Executive office directly implicated in the scandal is putting pressure on PAC members to go slow on the investigations and manipulate results.&ldquo;Most of the people named currently in media were just used to steal the money, but we will give all the details, including why the money was stolen and how it was used,&rdquo; said the Suba MP.The MPs claimed that the bank paid Sh40 million not to be found culpable in the probe over the loss of Sh1.8 billion.The money was received by an MP for onward transmission to his colleagues between November 5 and 13, although a number of them are said to have eventually not received their share.The 27-member committee is a watchdog panel chaired by Gumbo of Rarieda and deputised by Jubilee&rsquo;s Jackson Rop (Kipkelion West).A member of the committee yesterday told the Star in confidence that, &ldquo;It is true some money changed hands and we are told it is about Sh40 million from a bank which we were investigating.&rdquo;The MP said that soon after the meeting, several other banks were mentioned to create confusion.&ldquo;It was curious to note that a list of some 17 more banks which were not previously mentioned was availed to some committee members and a press conference which was covered live hurriedly convened,&rdquo; the lawmaker said.The MP said the purpose was to project the other banks as equally guilty of transacting in NYS money.&ldquo;I think the bank panicked and feared mass withdrawals by clients at that time, because it was apparent that it aided economic crimes of money laundering and prosecution was almost imminent,&rdquo; he said.The NYS probe has seen fierce verbal exchanges between committee members and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, whose law firm is under investigation over Sh15 million in NYS proceeds.Sing&rsquo;oei, Murkomen and Sigei Advocates is said to have received the money allegedly to buy a piece of land on behalf of its client, Out of the Box Solutions, which won a Sh302 million irregular tender at the ministry of Devolution.Yesterday, Murkomen maintained some members of the committee were engaging in extortion, targeting individuals and institutions named in the multi-billion-shilling NYS scam.&ldquo;I have received a lot of information from whistle-blowers and persons managing public resources that some committee members have been seeking to influence the investigations by extorting money,&rdquo; the Senate Deputy Majority Leader said.Murkomen, whom Gumbo on Thursday accused of intimidating and threatening the committee through &ldquo;abusive text messages&rdquo;, said he will write to National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to have the activities of the committee investigated.He said the claims by Gumbo are meant to divert attention.&ldquo;What I said is that at my level I am not going to engage in attempts of bribery,&rdquo; Murkomen said.Mbadi himself has been mentioned by Majority Leader Aden Duale as having done business with the NYS. Mbadi said the allegations are meant to blackmail the opposition and mislead Kenyans. &ldquo;I know the two names mentioned in Parliament. One company belongs to my wife (K&rsquo;Omoth Supplies Ltd) while the second is a name (Takawiri Enterprises Ltd) I wrote to the Registrar of Companies to reserve,&rdquo; said Mbadi. He added: &ldquo;I have two lorries known as Takawiri, but the company does not exist.&rdquo;The Suba MP said Duale was desperate to pick any information available to blackmail him over his position against corruption. &ldquo;He should walk out of Parliament Buildings and table information to the public how I benefited from the NYS theft. I have never done business with the government since 2006,&rdquo; said Mbadi.The PAC was reconstituted in April last year, after its former members led by Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba were hounded out of office over Sh1.5 million bribery claims.Some members of the former panel were accused of receiving bribes from the then Interior PS Mutea Iringo to cover up a Sh2.8 billion &lsquo;confidential expenditure&rsquo; in the Ministry of Interior for the 2012/13 financial year after it was queried by the Auditor General.Iringo was accused of dishing out millions to the committee members and allegedly promising them business opportunities with his department with a view to influencing their recommendations. Iringo denied the claims when he appeared before the Powers and Privileges Committee on March 23, 2015.
