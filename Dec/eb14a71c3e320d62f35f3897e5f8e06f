Kenya has been chosen to host a multi-billion Maritime Technology Cooperation Centre for Africa, beating South Africa, Ghana and Namibia which had also shown interest. The bids by International Maritime Organization, a UN agency which regulates shipping, were opened in April. The centre will promote co-operation in maritime technology. Kenya presented the bid through a consortium of organisations consisting of the Kenya Maritime Authority, the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and the Kenya Ports Authority. KMA acting director-general Cosmas Cherop said the centres will be hosted at KMA&rsquo;s Regional Maritime Rescue Centre located the KPA and JKUAT Mombasa campus. &ldquo;The MTCC will be established and resourced to become a centre of excellence, providing leadership in promoting ship energy-efficiency technologies and operations, and the reduction of harmful emissions from ships,&rdquo; Cherop said in a statement. The centre in Kenya will be one of the five centres to be established worldwide. Others will be established in Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. The centres, a joint IMO-European Union project, are aimed at building capacity for climate change mitigation in the maritime shipping industry.According to the IMO, the centres will receive &euro;10 million (about Sh1.09 billion) funding from the EU. The IMO said selection in the target regions was done competitively. &ldquo;Winning organisations and consortium of organisations had to have credible standing in their regions, considerable engagement with industry and government,&rdquo; IMO said.
