There will be no repeat elections in Embu, the Jubilee Party county presidential campaign coordinator has said.The election of interim JP officials turned violent last week in a number of counties, including Embu.Muchiri said after intense lobbying among leaders, 17 names of officials were presented to Jubilee headquarters. Only two slots are yet to be filled.The Manyatta MP said some leaders wanted to control the party and this led to chaos on Tuesday last week. Governor Martin Wambora and his arch-rivals Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Kithinji Kiragu ganged up against Senator Lenny Kivuti.Their supporters chanted and shouted at each other, broke chairs and tables until 6pm at Kangaru High School hall. At the end of the day, elections officer Abraham Limo had no list of interim officials.Muchiri said all leaders were given an opportunity to submit names to fill the 19 slots in the leadership structure.The legislator said it would have been wrong to allow some leaders to dominate and dictate who should be on the list.Muchiri spoke on Monday in Embu town during a public meeting. He urged Kiragu, who quit, to come back to the party.But Kiragu said he will only go back if JP guarantees a level playing field for all the candidates and promises that no leaders will get favours at the national level.He said he will still rally behind President Uhuru Kenyatta.
