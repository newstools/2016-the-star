The Kenya Private Sector Alliance Leadership Summit at the Coast that sought to enjoin the political sector to commit to peaceful campaigns and elections in 2017 was a commendable move.The summit theme was competitiveness, nationhood and peaceful elections. It brought together political party, religious and civil society leaders and captains of industry.But Cord skipped the event, accusing Kepsa of being an appendage of the Jubilee Party administration, whatever that means.It is important that all players put Kenya first, the country being bigger than the sum of its parts. All leaders and political formations should mind their language and entertain no propaganda of paranoia. The language of a political rally in an urban slum area is not the language of the corporate boardroom.Being rude to the private sector towards an election year is just plain dumb. Cord should respect others&rsquo; views and never more so than when it disagrees with them.
