At least 36 inmates at the Kamiti Prison have contracted Hepatitis B, even as the authorities battle to contain the virus that broke-out two weeks ago.Sources at the facility said 200 inmates have been screened and vaccinated. Thirty-six tested positive. The situation is very serious here. The place is small and we are all confined in one place, making the spread easier, a source said.Commissioner of prisons Isaiah Osugo said the virus might have been brought by a new inmate. He, however, said the situation is under control.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Nairobi Health executive Bernard Muia, whose officers in conjunction with facility s Health department and the Health ministry are fighting to stop the spread, said 200 inmates have been vaccinated. As the county, we are assisting in screening, vaccination and health promotion activities.
