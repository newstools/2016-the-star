Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda (pictured) will &ldquo;commit political suicide&rdquo; if he shelves his reelection bid in favour of nominated MP Oburu Oginga, a legislator said yesterday. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo asked Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and Nyando MP Fred Outa to distance themselves from Siaya county politics. Three weeks ago, Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango, Awiti and Outa asked Ochanda to step down for Oburu in next year&rsquo;s polls.
