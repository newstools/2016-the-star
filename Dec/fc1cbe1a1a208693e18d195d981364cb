Football Kenya Federation has declined mediation that was meant to resolve the league composition stalemate between them and Kenya Premier League.FKF and KPL have been at loggerheads over the number of teams in top flight premiership. KPL are keen on maintaining a-16-team Premier League while the football governing body, advocate for 18 teams in the 2017 season.The petition will enter full hearing next Tuesday at the Sports Disputes Tribunal. Elyna Shiveka, the tribunal&rsquo;s vice chairperson, indicated that mediation can&rsquo;t be forced on an unwilling party hence the case will advance to full hearing.The Tribunal noted distrust between the petitioner (KPL) and the respondent (FKF) when they appeared for progress mention at the Tribunal with both sides assuming opposing hardliner stance. The SDT had offered the two parties 14 days&rsquo; window to agree on the number of teams that will compete in the premier league, or determine by mediation, failure to which the court would hear the case.Both FKF and KPL failed to settle on the league composition and whereas the latter had appointed a team of five persons to the mediation team, the former were unyielding to the arbitration.&ldquo;We will not proceed to mediation. We have applied to have the petition heard. We are no confidence with the mediation process. At the end of it all, we may still disagree and the issue should be resolved in time so that teams can know the way forward,&rdquo; noted Ken Ochieng, FKF&rsquo;s council, adding that he is ready to make submissions for the court to settle the issue.On the other hand, KPL council Geoffrey Obura said: &ldquo;We are ready to engage in finding resolution to this subject so my clients can get down to work.&rdquo;
