Tana River Governor Hussein Dado has threatened to sack striking nurses and doctors in the county if they don&rsquo;t return to work in one week. Dado on Saturday termed it &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; for the doctors and the nurses to go on strike, saying all their demands, including promotions and better pay, have been met.
