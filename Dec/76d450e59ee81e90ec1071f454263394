Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba has urged Kenyans to vote out governors who have failed to realise the objectives and benefits of devolution. The LPK leader said devolution was included in the Constitution to promote equity in development. Namwamba spoke in Budalang&rsquo;i Primary School during Jamhuri Day celebrations on Monday. He said devolution must proceed as planned for the benefit of Kenyans.Namwamba said devolution was not established to divide this country, despite creating 47 counties. He said the President is still in charge of the entire nation and the counties are only meant to ensure fairness in resource distribution, so no region is neglected.
