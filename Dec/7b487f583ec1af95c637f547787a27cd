First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has said she is troubled by the fast growing number of HIV infections among young people aged between 15 and 24.Youths in this age bracket mostly in secondary schools and colleges constitute the highest number of new infections in Kenya today.The National Aids Control Council says of the 77,600 new infections last year, about 35,700 were among the 14-24-year-olds. As a predominantly young country, heavily reliant on our youth, and as a country which hopes to capitalise on the potential of women, we have to recognise that these trends are untenable and threaten to erode all the gains we have made nationally in the struggle against this disease, Kenyatta said.She spoke during celebrations to mark World Aids Day at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi, yesterday.Kenyatta said youths must be educated about their sexual activities and the availability of ARV drugs.She said Kenya should step up efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmissions and end stigma. HIV has made an enemy of all of us. And it is only when all of us come together, that we have any hope of finally getting to zero zero new infections and zero HIV-related deaths, Kenyatta said.Kenya has made significant progress in fighting HIV. Unlike two decades ago in 1996, when the HIV-Aids prevalence stood at 10.5 per cent, a multi-institutional war on the disease and high level political commitment have now reduced the prevalence to 5.9 per cent.
