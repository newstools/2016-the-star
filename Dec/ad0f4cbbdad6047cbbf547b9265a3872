Police halted prayers by Kikuyu elders soon after a spokesman for the community in Eldoret was installed at 7am. Samwel Kamunu wa Kabari, 80, was installed spokesman. The function had allegedly been banned, but deputy county commissioner John Kinjo said the elders applied for a permit and no one opposed it. The elders outwitted the police, staging an early morning ceremony to install the spokesman. The event had been opposed by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and some Kikuyu and Kalenjin leaders over security concerns. Some leaders had asked that it be done after the 2017 polls.
