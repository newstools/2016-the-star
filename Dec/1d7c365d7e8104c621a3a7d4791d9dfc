Pope Francis has warned Christmas that has been "taken hostage" by rampant materialism.He said the Christian world had become obsessed with gifts and feasting, and needed to show more humility.The pontiff&rsquo;s comments in his Christmas Eve homily were followed by further condemnation of the "idolatry of money" in his Christmas morning address from the balcony of St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica on Sunday.Both appearances came amid tight security in the wake of the Berlin terror attack and shooting dead in Milan of the suspect.In his Urbi Et Orbi address, Francis said: &lsquo;"Peace to the peoples who suffer because of the economic ambitions of the few, because of the sheer greed and the idolatry of money, which leads to slavery." He urged Palestinians and Israelis to put aside hate and revenge and &lsquo;write a new page of history."Read more: Pope Francis Christmas message: Stop loving money, remember migrants and refugeesAlso read: 'Do small things with great love', Queen Elizabeth says in holiday message
