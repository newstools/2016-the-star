The scramble for ODM nominations in Mombasa could potentially split the party.The party leadership in Mombasa is in a dilemma as popular candidates face each other in the primaries set for February.Already, some of the candidates and their supporters are threatening to ditch the party, alleging plots to rig them out. If this happens, the party will lose crucial supporters.In Kisauni constituency, businessman Ali Mbogo is giving MP Rashid Bedzimba a run for his money.He has alleged a plot to rig him out of the nominations race and has threatened to ditch the party should he feel the nominations are unfair.This is despite assurances from Mombasa chairman Mohamed Hatimy that nominations will be fair.Mbogo is close to party leader Raila Odinga, while Bedzimba is Joho&rsquo;s favourite. &ldquo;If they do not give us direct nominations, they can stay with their party,&rdquo; Mbogo said on Sunday.Raila and Joho are keen not to lose Mbogo, who has financial resources as well as clout. Bedzimba also has clout and experience.In Nyali, Joho&rsquo;s cousin Said &lsquo;Saido&rsquo; Abdalla and journalist Mohamed Ali, who is close to Governor Hassan Joho, have intensified their campaigns, making the race for the nomination very close. Supporters of Saido have alleged a plot to hand the ticket to the investigative journalist. They say Saido has ground support and has been campaigning longer.Saido and Ali received endorsements from supporters when they addressed the crowds at Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Hall last week at an event attended by Joho.In Changamwe, the incumbent Omar Mwinyi, who won in 2013 with a landslide, is facing a youthful football administrator, Alliy Goshi, who has Joho&rsquo;s approval.Goshi is popular among the youth, while Mwinyi has the support of adults and older women, including teachers in the constituency, who have massive influence.Mwinyi, who was an ally of Joho, has since drifted apart from the governor over differences about Changamwe&rsquo;s development projects.On Tuesday, Hatimy told the Star the party is working to ensure a free and fair nomination, which has traditionally been marred by violence and allegations of favouritism.&ldquo;We are keen to ensure the party remains united. We will do everything possible to ensure it remains strong,&rdquo; Hatimy said on the phone.The nominations headache and how it is handled will make or break ODM ahead of the elections, with Wiper and Jubilee lurking in the periphery, waiting to pounce on defectors.In 2013, similar defections over nominations helped Wiper gain a significant number of supporters.
