The Iloodokilani Women&rsquo;s Network in Kajiado West last Thursday helped the assistant county commissioner arrest a man marrying off his 10-year-old daughter. Ketuke Kitasho said he was marrying her off due to poverty. Elders asked police to release him as he had not yet handed her over to her suitor.
