Experiences of childhood have significantly changed and it is no longer all fun and games for children who now have to be protected from all kinds of predators.While it used to be that an entire village would chip in to raise a child, that is no longer the case.As social structures continue to disintegrate, parents are left with the sole responsibility of guarantee the safety of their own children while still working long hours to put food on the table.&ldquo;But the most chilling truth that parents have to contend with is that in spite of this responsibility, most of the time, the life of their children is not in their hands,&rdquo; explains Maryana Munyendo, the founder and lead trainer of Simba Safe Kenya and also Missing Child Kenya.The latter team provides free resources for the search of missing children between the ages of 0-18 years.While Simba Safe is a personal safety education program where children and young adults, are taught age appropriate safety skills necessary to protect themselves in risky situations which have become a part and parcel of the modern world.Not only do parents have to consider the physical danger that is often lurking but with the digital wave sweeping across the country, just a click of the button could change a child&rsquo;s life in the most traumatising way possible.DANGEROUS GROUNDS The digital era has not only brought immense opportunities to interact both socially and economically, but also untold dangers lie in wait behind the screen waiting to pounce on curious children who have taken to technology like fish to water.Without a doubt, the internet is a necessary tool that accords children one of the most powerful communication and education tool in a manner that is new and thrilling.But it is nonetheless a networking adventure that must be closely monitored since if used wisely, it can significantly broaden a child&rsquo;s thinking and perception of the world beyond their immediate environment.&ldquo;Kenya's digital literacy programmes while speaking to the needs of the digital world have at the same time created an environment where children are significantly vulnerable,&rdquo; Munyendo explains.She says that cases of children, especially young girls chatting with older men who lure them to even send nude pictures are alarmingly high.Cybercaf&eacute;s have made it easy for pedophiles to hide behind the screen while using pictures of celebrities to entice young girls with promises of travel and adventure.Children can now access the internet through the computer or phone at home, school or in cybercaf&eacute;s strategically positioned not only in town but within the estate.&ldquo;Dangers that children are exposed to online are basically three fold. First there is a lot of age inappropriate content online that children can easily access, there is also cyber bullying amongst themselves and also online fraud,&rdquo; she explains.Munyendo says that online fraud occurs when children are tricked into transacting in order to play a game.Since most of these games are exciting and fascinating for the children they will do whatever is necessary to play.She further says that the current online culture which is very aggressive and abrasive where children can see their own parents contributing to bullying has created an impression that this is the way online business is conducted.&ldquo;Simba Safe Kenya is therefore keen on promoting appropriate online etiquette while also addressing areas that increase the vulnerability of children online,&rdquo; she says.Munyendo explains that just a few years ago, going online was a uphill task and it was also not affordable, but there has been a shift in recent years where computers are not the only gateway to go online.There are scores of cellular phone handsets that are significantly affordable with various affordable internet bundle tariffs designed to keep people online.&ldquo;Some are very cheap and are only meant for the younger age group. This means that there is increased connectivity and access to the internet but without a parallel acceleration of online safety measures,&rdquo; she observes.Further saying that since children are growing in a context where the digital world has immensely opened up, they are therefore learning the internet and discovering it faster than their own parents.PROTECTIVE MEASURESShe therefore advises parents to build closer relationships with their parents but to also create time to explore the internet with their children, this way, a child will feel free to share their online adventures.This way, potential dangers can be detected early and thwarted.Through Simba Safe Kenya, Munyendo works with many stakeholders who are concerned about children welfare to ensure that experiences of childhood are beautiful and memorable.She decries the fact that most children are now being raised in a bubble because their parents are too afraid to let them out of their sight in fear that someone will take advantage of them and cause harm.This she says means that the children have not developed their own risk assessment mechanisms and when exposed to danger they will not be able to respond appropriately.According to Munyendo teaching children about their own personal safety is not just a matter of awareness and empowerment but it is a way to assist children to be both proactive and assertive.&ldquo;A child must be taught that it is okay to say no and that not all adults have their best interests at heart,&rdquo; she says.To do this the organisation focuses on institutions which provide access to many children at once, and more importantly, children who are in age clusters.This therefore means that schools are a primary target, churches and also home groups through Estate Associations.Home group associations provide an opportunity to access nannies who also play a critical role in a child&rsquo;s life. Currently, this safety lessons are taking place in Nairobi and its environs.&ldquo;Having worked in the education sector, my passion to create a safe environment for children grew while I was working as a communication officer for a non-profit making school for orphaned and vulnerable children,&rdquo; she says.While at the school she witnessed firsthand the degree of risk facing children on a daily basis.She says that children&rsquo;s own curiosity has served to increase their vulnerability and while this curiosity should not be discouraged, safety measures must be put in place.Towards these measures, the primary targets here are the children, teachers and then the parents.&ldquo;We therefore work with teachers because they spend a lot of time with children and are instrumental in their socialisation. Although the online space is a fun way for children to explore and socialise, if they are not taught how to stay safe this could have serious repercussions.USEFUL TIPSAccording to Munyendo keeping children offline is not the solution but there are many tips that can keep children safe online.Children often get into trouble online by primarily providing personal information to strangers, sharing passwords with their best friends, sharing pictures and more importantly, physically meeting people that they &lsquo;meet&rsquo; online.Personal information might even include details of their parents and there have been cases where children are used as proxies to either settle scores or to hurt their parents.In other instances, children can easily be used to commit crimes since they are easily convinced and may not question &lsquo;authority&rsquo; especially if the online friend is a grown up.Children must therefore be taught to never physically meet anyone that they &lsquo;met&rsquo; online without a parent or guardian.They must be constantly reminded to avoid sharing personal information about their families especially phone numbers, physical address or even where their parents work.Children must also be encouraged to constantly consult their parents or teachers if something happens online that makes them feel uncomfortable without the fear of being reprimanded.&ldquo;But even as we address the children and train them to be good online citizens, it must start with the parents. If children go online and see parents behaving in a certain way, they are likely to gravitate in that direction,&rdquo; she cautions.SIMBA SAFE KENYA Akamba Court, Woodland Lane Off Argwings Kodhek RoadTel: +254 715856885info@simbasafekenya.co.ke
