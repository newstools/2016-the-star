The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists&rsquo; Board on Sunday rejected an offer for a pay rise by the government outside the Collective Bargaining Agreement agreement signed three years ago. KMPDU declined to call off the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike, saying the CBA must be implemented fully and it will not accept offers made outside the Agreement. Secretary general Ouma Oluga (pictured) said, however, they mobilised some of their members to help victims of the Naivasha accident, in solidarity with the families of those who lost their lives. They joined Kenyans in sending their condolences to the bereaved. Oluga urged the government to implement the CBA so they can resume duty and end the suffering of Kenyans. &ldquo;We are very sorry as a union that the accident occurred at a time when we are on strike, but we have asked our members around Naivasha and Nairobi to help the victims,&rdquo; he said. Treasurer Daisy Korir said, &ldquo;They [the government] have been trying to lure us with some offers which are not anchored in the CBA. We will not accept that because sometime back they gave us similar offers on allowances, which were later withdrawn.&rdquo; She accused the government of being unwilling to talk about the CBA. The strike by the medics enters the second week with services paralysed in most hospitals countrywide. Oluga and Korir spoke in Eldoret where the national union officials attended a church service at the AIC Church.
