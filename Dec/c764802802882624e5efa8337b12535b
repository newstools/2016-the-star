The Matatu Welfare Association has moved to court seeking to stop the implementation of the new increased insurance premiums for PSVs.MWA, Tel-Aviv Travellers Ltd and 100 others say the process of deciding and increasing the rates is not open, transparent and accountable.Through lawyer Evans Ondieki, the association says they have invested billions of shillings in the matatu sector and public transport and they stand to suffer irreversible losses.They say the increased premiums will undermine business growth and lead to the loss of more than 100,000 jobs.The association says between 2012-16 the percentage of accidents arising from PSV&rsquo;s have declined, yet there is no corresponding reduction of the insurance rates, charges, fees and licenses.In a sworn affidavit, MWA chairman Dickson Keru said Invesco Assurance Company Ltd, Direct Line Assurance Company Ltd, Insurance Regulatory Authority and Association of Kenya Insurers have unreasonably increased the rates for PSVs.&ldquo;An analysis shows the respondents accepted old rates of Sh7,817 until November 29 and the new rates have shot to Sh9,005,&rdquo; reads the affidavit.Keru said the actions of the respondents have threatened, violated and denied the petitioners their fundamental rights and freedoms.He said the association has been devastated because their source of livelihood has been undermined and most of their vehicles have been impounded.
