Eight Kenyan and international human rights groups have petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to form a commission of inquiry into extrajudicial killings.The petition comes as the world marks international human rights day and just days after police rubbished Haki Africa report documenting 81 cases of police executions and enforced disappearances of alleged suspects at the Coast in the last four years.In a joint December 10, letter to the president they said their independent research and media reports shows credible evidence that Kenya Police Service, Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Wildlife Service and the National Intelligence Service have killed, disappeared or tortured suspects of terror or other crimes.However justice for such cases has been inconsistent and victims are often left without avenues for redress, they said adding that authorities fail to acknowledge or publicly condemn the abuses."Instead government officials have denied that such abuses occur without investigating the allegations and, in some instances, threatened families, and the media and human rights activists who advocate for justice for the victims,&rdquo; the letter reads in part.Read: Extrajudicial killings an epidemic, Haki Africa says, details 81 cases "... whereas killings, torture and disappearances continue with no holding to account suspected security officers for their alleged actions," the letter said."The Kenyan president has a responsibility to ensure that all government forces respect national and international human rights law and adhere to due process," Otsieno Namwaya, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. "Victims of killings and disappearances by security agencies deserve answers and a commission of inquiry is a critical first step," The lobbyists said the range of security units involved and the geographical scope of the abuses had expanded in recent years.In 2013 Open Justice Initiative by Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI) found that ATPU were behind the killings and disappearances of those suspected to be linked with Alshabab at the Coast.Read: State's divide and rule tactic fueling extrajudicial killings - MuhuriIn 2014, the Independent Medico-Legal Unit recorded 199 cases of extrajudicial killings, and 97 by October 2015, including 85 summary executions perpetrated by polices and the Kenya Wildlife Service.In its Error of Fighting Terror with Terror report released in September last year, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, a state agency, documented 120 widespread cases of systematic and well-coordinated arbitrary arrests, extortion, illegal detention, torture, killings and disappearances of individuals linked to al Shabaab at the coast, in Nairobi and in the northeast. The shocking human rights violations were perpetrated by members of the national police, military and wildlife police.In its Deaths and Disappearances: Abuses in Counterterrorism Operations in Northeastern Kenya report launched in July, Human Rights Watch recorded 34 cases of extrajudicial killings.Eleven deaths of people last seen in state custody over links to terror group al Shabaab in the last eight months were also recorded.The involvement of multiple units (KDF, KWS, GSU and NIS) and lack of investigations indicated they were more than simply the work of rogue officers the organisation.Also read: Extrajudicial killings in Kenya have been dealt with, CS Amina tells Al JazeeraHowever, in an official response to increasing cases of executions of suspects in the hands of police, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery in October seemed irked terming the allegations unsubstantiated, given in bad faith and aimed at undermining police efforts in crime control.Nkaissery said the government is aware there is a conspiracy to undermine the excellent work of the police.This week the National police service commissioner Murshid Abdalla seemed irked as he dismissed the report as well the Inspector general of police through the spokesperson George Kinoti cast aspersion on the extrajudicial killings arguing that authors of the report were sympathetic to terrorists.More on this: Naivasha dumped bodies add twist to Kenya's puzzle of extrajudicial killings In view of the widespread nature of the abuses and the fact that multiple security units are usually involved, especially in counter-terrorism operations, it is unlikely that existing accountability institutions can effectively investigate and ensure justice for the victims and their families. This is why Uhuru in public interests needs to establish a special commission of inquiry in line with the Kenya Commissions of Inquiry Act of 1962.Allegations of abuse extend from the coastal region to Nairobi and the northeast. Most of the abuses in these regions have been in response to al Shabaab attacks. Kenyan media and human rights organizations have recently been reporting another worrying trend in killings of young people by security forces &ndash; mainly the police they said in the letter.They said despite increased cases of killings of young people in rural areas and informal settlement or low income areas in urban centre they have been rarely investigated."Although the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), a civilian policing accountability institution, has a mandate to investigate such cases, their widespread nature and the possibility that other security agencies may be involved alongside the police, calls for a special mechanism," the letter advises."These violations must not be swept under the carpet. The president must take action to ensure the victims get justice, in line with the oath he took to protect the constitution," said Abdullahi Halakhe, East Africa researcher at Amnesty International.Kenya Human Rights Commission, International Justice, Independent Medico-Legal unit (IMLU), Haki Africa, Muhuri, Wajir Paralegals Network are among those organisation that joined HRW, and Amnesty in signing the letter.
