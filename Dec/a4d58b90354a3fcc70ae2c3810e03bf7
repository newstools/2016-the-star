Kakamega senator has lashed at COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli over plans to name the Luhya community's preferred presidential candidate ahead of 2017 poll. Atwoli said the candidate will be named during an end year fete on December 31 at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega.But Boni Khalwale said the COTU boss was creating unnecessary sideshows that should not be taken seriously."What Atwoli is doing is a sideshow. The focus is on removing Uhuruto and putting Kenya back on track [sic]," Khalwale said through a tweet on Wednesday.The senator further said the Luhya vote will be delivered when the community is united and not divided."With Mudavadi working with Cord, I can confirm that Mudavadi-Wetangula-Khalwale trio will deliver Baluhya vote 100%," he added.Khalwale's tweets elicited responses from his followers with others asking him to deliver his promises."@KBonimtetezi @Team_Cord I have saved this tweet.... Please deliver," a twitter user, identified as Yki Sez, &rlm;said.Ibrahim, another user, said: "It's time to bind the wounds of division. The Luhya people have been insulted big time,"But other users, calling Amani Leader Musalia Mudavadi 'a prodigal son' suggested that the latter has nothing to bring to the table."@KBonimtetezi unfortunately @MusaliaMudavadi, like the prodigal son, comes with nothing but himself, after a mismanaged political career," a user, only identified as Mwalimumkuu, said.On Tuesday, Atwoli said he is not interested in national politics but has the zeal to unite the Luhya community.He said the unveiled candidate will either be mandated to go it alone in the August 8 vote or team up with political outfits that are keen on sending Jubilee home.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and a section of legislators allied to the party opposed Atwoli's plan.Mudavadi, Wetang'ula, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and former Speaker Kenneth Marende are among the Luhya leaders being considered in the choice.Close sources to Atwoli said that the COTU boss and his team are scheduled to settle on Mudavadi as the preferred presidential candidate.Eyes are now set on how the decision will go with Senator Wetang'ula following his declaration to bid for president under Cord.Read: Atwoli to name voice of Luhyas, &lsquo;restore unity&rsquo; on New Year&rsquo;s EveAlso read: Don&rsquo;t impose spokesperson on Luhyas, politicians urge Atwoli
