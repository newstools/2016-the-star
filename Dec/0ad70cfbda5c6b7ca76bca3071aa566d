Facebook Messenger is making it easier to send snaps to loved ones during this year's Christmas festivities.A new built-in 'Messenger Camera' has been designed to make it quicker to capture and share photos and videos. Users can capture snaps with one tap without having to dip out of a conversation. You can also customise pictures and videos with new frames, stickers, masks and artwork.Users can simply tap the camera icon to bring up a shutter button - which shots on a background with the Holiday theme.A tap takes a photo while a long press records a video. "We are especially excited to debut 3D masks and special effects, which make it super easy to apply an artistic filter to your full screen photo and to turn your world into a work of art," said Facebook. Users can also tap on the palette icon by the shutter to fire up a blank canvas where they can add art and stickers just like on snapchat. The update is set to roll out globally to Messenger users in the coming days.
