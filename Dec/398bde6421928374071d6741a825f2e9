After clinching second overall position in the 2016 karting championship, former KNRC female navigator Gillian Bailey is testing her newly acquired buggy in time for her 2017 national autocross debut.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m entering the 2017 autocross championship and hope to have some fun and get the experience and skill needed to be behind the wheel of this awesome piece of machinery. I love speed, I love competition, so what more can I ask for,&rdquo; said Gillian. Gillian started navigating in 1994 when she guided Lyndsey Mcintyre at the start of her racing career. She went on to navigate Kimathi Mwangi, Patrick Njiru and Glen Edmunds.&ldquo;I stopped racing in 2001 when I got pregnant with Ryan. But when Ryan was 2 1/2 years old, I sat back in the seat with Glen for one rally in Kisumu as his regular navigator was overseas.&ldquo;That was the last rally I did as we had a huge accident in the sugar plantation where I broke my back. Ryan then started motorsport at the age of 5 years old, first with motocross, then buggying and now autocross. At the beginning of this go kart season, Ryan pushed me to start Go-Kart racing at Mai Maihu and The Great Rift Valley circuit. He told me it was time I had some fun on the track, racing as I had supported him for the last 10 years in all his motorsports career,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When it comes to speed and adrenaline rush, I don&rsquo;t need much persuading. We finished the Go Kart season a few weeks ago, and I finished 2nd overall in my class in the 2016 championship.&rdquo;
