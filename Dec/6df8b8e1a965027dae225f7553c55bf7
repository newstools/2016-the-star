Half of Kenya would vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta if presidential elections were held today, a poll by Ipsos released yesterday suggests.The poll shows that while 50 per cent of those polled would vote for Uhuru, only 22 per cent would vote for his 2013 main challenger, Cord leader Raila Odinga.The poll suggests that Uhuru has lost one point from the 51 per cent he got in a previous poll in June, while Raila has shed six per cent from 28 per cent.Ipsos chief researcher Tom Wolf explained that while Uhuru&rsquo;s candidature is under the Jubilee Party, Raila is still in talks with other opposition leaders on who should be the flagbearer.&ldquo;Such uncertainty on the opposition side is also reflected in the correlation of such presidential vote-choice, with partisan alignment. Specifically, whereas more than nine-in-10 Jubilee supporters express their intention to vote for Kenyatta ( 93 per cent), only three-quarters of Cord supporters do likewise for Raila ( 75 per cent),&rdquo; Wolf said.According to the poll, other key opposition leaders Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi would get two per cent and one per cent of the votes.It added that while 16 per cent of those polled said they were still undecided, another seven per cent refused to say who they intend to vote for. The poll shows that Uhuru would beat Raila in all the former provinces apart from Nyanza, which is the opposition leader&rsquo;s home ground.In Nyanza, Raila would get 42 per cent of the votes, with Uhuru scoring 31 per cent, while 18 per cent of those polled are undecided. In Central, a key Jubilee backyard, Uhuru would get 75 per cent of the votes with Raila getting seven per cent, with 13 per cent undecided.In Coast, the poll shows Uhuru would get 45 per cent, compared to Raila&rsquo;s 24 per cent, with the undecided at 17 per cent.&ldquo;Nearly one-in-five, however, choose to identify with no political grouping as of now,&rdquo; Wolf said. The data shows that 45 per cent said they feel closest to Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee Party, while 19 per cent said they feel close to Raila&rsquo;s ODM.The poll was conducted between December 17 and 19 among 1,083 people randomly selected from Ipsos&rsquo; CATI data-base spread across 41 counties.
