Nairobi county will receive support from the 100 Resilient Cities - pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation - to develop a city resilience strategy against urbanisation problems.The donor will help the city hire a chief resilience officer as well as provide technical advise on management of the city's affairs.100 Resilient Cities regional director Otis Rolley yesterday said this follows the county&rsquo;s successful application to join the network which comprises 100 top cities in the world.Rolley said Nairobi&rsquo;s resilience strategy involves partnerships and financing mechanisms to meet the needs of the poor and the vulnerable population.As a member of the network, Nairobi will receive grants to hire a chief resilience officer to work with county leaders in developing a city resilience strategy.Governor Evans Kidero said some of the problems in Nairobi include old infrastructure, garbage, traffic jams, road accidents and terrorist threats.He cited the 1980 bomb blast among other terrorist attacks, collapsed buildings and floods as some of the tragedies the city has faced recently."This platform will help Nairobi avert shocks that are part of a growing city," Kidero said.
