A man armed with a panga ambushed five worshippers attending overnight prayers at God&rsquo;s Last Appeal Church, Rugunga, Bunyala South, on Saturday. Pastor Henry Mudondo said the man is a resident of Asembo East location, Rarieda. He wanted to steal church property but he did not know there were people inside. Mudondo said they arrested him as he tried to escape and called police from Maumau trading centre. Rose Apudo said they heard someone struggling to break the church door. They rushed out and grabbed him as he attempted to flee. Mudondo said they are concerned about the rising burglary cases in churches at Maumau trading centre. He appealed to security agencies in Bunyala subcounty to protect them against frequent invasions and theft of church property.
