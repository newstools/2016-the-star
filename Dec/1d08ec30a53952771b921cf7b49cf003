The normally silent environment at the Daisy Special School for the Physically Handicapped and Vocational Training in Kakamega burst into life on December 1.This was after their student Victor Odhiambo, 15, emerged the top performer nationally in the KCPE exam, scoring 437 marks out of 500.The school, on the outskirts of Kakamega town, was started in 1993 by church missionary Patty Sodaland, who had a physically handicapped child and decided to start the school.Two years later, he surrendered it to the Full Gospel Churches of Kenya as the sponsor church. Unable to run it, the church handed it over to the government in 1995 as a public school.The school admits children with disabilities and those with mild challenges. Also enrolled in the school are children who cannot go for the normal curriculum, who have their talents identified and given correct placement.The school also offers vocational training besides an integrated programme where normal students are admitted alongside those with disabilities.Head teacher Rosemary Obiero says such classes run on Individualised Education Programme, where all students are assessed, the weak identified and individual programmes prepared for each category.&ldquo;Students with certain weaknesses are assisted individually by the teachers during free time like games time. They are later put in groups and their work supervised,&rdquo; she says.The teaching is done largely using teaching aids like charts, starting from class one work to ensure they have grasped the concepts, she says.Obiero says that some with behavioural problems are counselled by a strong guidance and counselling department.She says the integration programme is not doing well as parents as reluctant to let their children mix with those with disabilities.On the 2016 results, Obiero says she asked teachers to commit to turn around the results or resign if they did not want to work at the station.The school presented 21 candidates for the 2016 examination. It has a population of 273 children. It has 20 teaching and a similar number of support staff.The school scored a mean score of 332.4, up from 239.76 in 2015 results.The school had three candidates above 400 marks, 15 with 300 and above and three below 250 marks.&ldquo;They committed to ensure results and we came up with the theme for the year as transforming and achieving and that is what drove us,&rdquo; she said.I visited homes of the children in second term to assess the conditions there and noticed most of them were living in squalid conditions, she adds.Obiero says her posts on Facebook calling for support in the beginning of the year bore fruits in second term, when well-wishers donated blankets and mattresses to the school.In second term, another well-wisher offered to pay for lunch for all the children for the remaining part of the year, and it was at this point that she decided to keep all the candidates in the school as boarders to concentrate on examination.Infrastructure challengesThe school lacks adequate classrooms. Its six existing classrooms have been partitioned using plywood to create space for the learners.This interferes with teaching when two tutors are teaching different subjects. Two makeshift classrooms the school began constructing have stalled due to lack of funds.Obiero says the school lacks wheelchairs to wheel the children from one point to the other. &ldquo;They are forced to share the existing few wheelchairs and in most instances, teachers are forced to literally carry the children to and from where they are expected,&rdquo; she says.The capitation the government allocates is not enough and matters are made worse by most parents failing to pay fees. You cannot sent a child home to bring money on a wheelchair and their parents are from poor backgrounds.&ldquo;More frequent sickness of the children even makes our work harder because when the government gives money per child, you cannot do virement without approval, yet the sick child needs attention,&rdquo; she says. The school lacks a nurse and sick children have to be rushed to hospital with the support of their parents.She says the children eat continuously because some of them do not have feelings to know when they are satisfied.The school lacks a playground and pupils have to play in shifts, lacks a kitchen and dining hall and children feeds in verandas.A dining hall started by the Lurambi CDF over six years ago has been abandoned with walls barely a metre high.Most critical, the school lacks physiotherapy equipment, despite most learners requiring therapy daily to stabilise.
