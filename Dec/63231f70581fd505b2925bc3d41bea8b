Kenya Airways stock remained largely steady yesterday despite a go-slow by a section of its technical staff disrupting some of its scheduled flights.Shares trading on the Nairobi Securities Exchange gained a marginal 0.78 per cent day-on-day towards the close of trade to Sh6.50 a piece.The national carrier, which has embarked on a search for a new chief executive to replace outgoing Mbuvi Ngunze, said operational constraints resulted in delays for nine flights early yesterday.&ldquo;We would like to advise our guests that while we have some delays due to a number of our technicians going on a go-slow, most of our flight are on schedule today (yesterday),&rdquo; the loss-making airline said in a statement. &ldquo;We continue to work to reduce these disruptions and are advising any guests affected directly.&rdquo;KQ, owned about 29 per cent by the state, said it was working to resolve the issue to normalise operations, adding that "our technical team is a vital part of our business&rdquo;.Pilots, through their association, blamed the go-slow on KQ's delay to resolve issues around the pay structure and allowances, which has affected their morale.They also cited abuse of seniority by managers and lack of hierarchy in the organisational structure of the airline.&ldquo;Our professionalism, social and team work spirit have been negatively impacted upon,&rdquo; said a letter signed by the Kenya Airline Pilots Association on November 29.This are the same issues that saw more than 60 pilots quit the national carrier for greener pastures in the rival Middle East airlines in the financial year 2015.Hundreds of engineers have also left Kenya Airways in recent months to look for better pay package, which the airline has been unable to meet due to poor performance and mounting debts.KQ has been reducing the size of its fleet, selling non-core assets like land and cutting jobs to recover from the losses it incurred after tourism slumped. It has also said previously that it requires fresh capital of Sh70 billion ($691 million).It reported that net loss narrowed by 40 percent to Sh7.13 billion in the half year ended September 30 from Sh11.95 billion posted in the same period last year.KQ's pilots have largely blamed the top management and senior executives for the current loss-making streak and demanded their exit.Former Kenya Airways board chairman Denis Awori resigned on October 26 and was replaced by Safaricom founding CEO Michael Joseph. Chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze is expected to leave KQ at the first quarter of 2017.
