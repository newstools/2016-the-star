An NGO yesterday demanded the electoral agency announce final election results at polling, county and national centres as part of the electoral reforms.International Centre for Policy and Conflict said the move will stop manipulation of results and rigging.ICPC executive director Ndung&rsquo;u Wainaina urged the IEBC to conduct adequate education on the roadmap and exhibit impartiality, competence and transparency in its management of electoral processes.&ldquo;It would be critical for IEBC to establish sufficient measures so that tallying of the final results and the announcement is done at polling stations and simultaneously transmitted to the county headquarters and the national centre,&rdquo; he said.He added that the 2017 general election will be Kenya&rsquo;s most competitive election.&ldquo;Although most of the elections conducted in the past had presented some serious challenges, the 2017 general elections are likely to present much more serious challenges unless serious plans are made well in advance to ensure there are no hitches as experienced in the last general election, where the Biometric Voter Registration machines and electronic transmission of results failed. No satisfactory answers were provided, despite huge public money expenditure in acquisition of the equipment,&rdquo; Ndung&rsquo;u said.
