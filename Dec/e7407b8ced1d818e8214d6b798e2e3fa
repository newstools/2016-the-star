The audit of the voter register is to start tomorrow, once the IEBC signs the contract.Chief executive Ezra Chiloba yesterday said the contractor will sign the audit contract with the commission. However, he said the law prohibits him from revealing the name of the contractor until the deal is signed.&ldquo;We had to wait for 14 days as required by law before signing the contract. The 14 days end on the 16th,&rdquo; Chiloba said.Some of the firms that bid for the job areErnst and Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, PKF, Lamtech and Compton.The successful bidder will have until the end of the month to audit the voter register to allow the IEBC time to report to Parliament before the next mass voter registration. The process will include identifying double registrations, the names of dead voters and other issues.
