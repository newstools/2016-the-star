As the year 2016 ends, it is time to reflect on what happened during the year. While good things occurred, sad events also transpired, including the killing of Mohawk (so named because of his funky mane ), the magnificent iconic lion, in terrible circumstances. Mohawk was a magnificent lion in almost every way: powerfully built with a dark black mane, and popular with the lion ladies and many cubs sired through him. I remember once being amazed that he killed a huge eland near No6 dam. The pride really enjoyed that feast.For many years I drove through Mohawk's territory almost twice daily, and always looked to see if he was around. Sometimes he would go roaming for a week or two. But often, he was seen in his territory that consisted mainly of the Embakasi plains (from no4,5,6,7 junctions and the Eland valley area), Masai gate, and Kingfisher area and even stretched up into the forest. Mohawk reigned successfully not just because of his power but because he had coalitions with various lions like Charlie, Sam and Cheru.On April 30, the sad news of Mohawk&rsquo;s terrible killing quickly went global. Many people, including international tourists, loved him. He was one of the most photographed lions in the park, seemingly not bothered by people in cars all looking at him. We hope and pray that justice for Mohawk and Lemek will follow, and that the Kenya Wildlife Service with ensure the future of the Nairobi National Park lions by improved conservation management methods. Rest in peace, Mohawk the Magnificent. We will never forget.
