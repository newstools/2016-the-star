Three Wajir legislators skipped yesterday&rsquo;s Jamhuri Day celebrations in the county over a supremacy battle with Governor Ahmed Abdullahi.The three also walked out of the October 20 Mashujaa Day celebrations in the county as the governor rose to read his speech after they were heckled by the crowd.They are Wajir Senator Abdirahman Hassan, MPs Adan Keynan (Eldas) and Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj). They were expected to put up a political showdown in Wajir town yesterday.Abdullahi announced he will run for reelection.&ldquo;We still have many ideas and there are many projects that we would like to implement. It is for these reasons that I will be offering myself for reelection...I am hopeful that given our success in this transition term, we will achieve even more in the next term,&rdquo; he said.Abdullahi appeared to have won residents&rsquo; hearts last week, when the public supported the projects he proposed during the Equalisation Fund public participation forum.The governor used the Jamhuri Day celebrations yesterday to list his achievements and call for support.He said he took over an administration that had many problems and he is proud his team has &ldquo;transformed Wajir in the last four years&rdquo;.&ldquo;In 2013 during the election period, my campaign slogan was my &lsquo;pledge of service&rsquo; to you the people of Wajir...I believe our pledge to provide improved services, in all the 14 devolved functions, to the people of Wajir, has been fulfilled as far as our annual targets were concerned,&rdquo; Abdullahi said&ldquo;We took over the administration of this county when we had poor infrastructure, our skilled delivery rate was very low, our water sources were very few and the foundation of our children&rsquo;s education was pathetic. Today, this county stands tall as an example where devolution is working.&rdquo;Since July 2013, the county has improved healthcare by hiring 576 health workers, building 21 new dispensaries and 42 new maternity wings, and increasing the number of operational health facilities from 64 to 107, Abdullahi said.This has improved our skilled hospital delivery from 19 per cent to 36 per cent, and our immunisation cover today stands at 59 per cent, up from 39 per cent, he said. The governor said the county headquarters is complete and already in use. It will save the county millions of shillings in rent, he added.&ldquo;When we took over in 2013, my administration could not even find an office to operate from. We rented private premises for various departments to have an operation base,&rdquo; he said.Abdullahi said the construction of the county assembly headquarters is in its final stage and will be ready for occupation by the end of March.He said Wajir has tarmacked many roads, especially those in and around the county&rsquo;s central business district.
