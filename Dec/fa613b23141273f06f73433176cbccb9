[We also] call upon them to shun the current trend that is increasingly entrenching a disturbing practice of regime policing," he said.The vice chairman accused the state of threatening civil society space by de-registering the International Foundation for Electoral Systems [IFES] on December 19. NGO coordination board executive director Fazul Mohamed issued a statement saying IFES was illegally carrying out an electoral assistance programme."Mahamed&rsquo;s attack on IFES is a flagrant misrepresentation of facts and smacks of severe mischief, recklessness and ill-will. The commission notes that Mahamed was recently declared unfit to hold public office following investigations by the Commission for Administrative Justice [CAJ] for abuse of office and misconduct," said Morara."The commission views the latest attack on IFES as part of an ongoing campaign by the state and the political class, aimed at restricting the civic space especially targeted on CSOs that are perceived to be critical of the government."Read: US disputes Kenya's allegation that IFES is not a registered companyAlso read: High Court stops NGOs board from derigestering IFES
