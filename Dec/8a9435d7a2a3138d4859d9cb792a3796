Nyandarua leaders should protect quarry workers and help address problems they face so they can be successful and improve their lives, a leader has said.Woman representative Wanjiku Muhia said quarry workers face many problems, including marketing of building stones and security for their tools.Workers, at Ol Kalou town quarry have complained that officials of the defunct Nyandarua County Council allocated some sections of the quarry to private individuals. This, they say, puts them in daily fear of eviction.Muhia spoke on Wednesday when she visited 1,260 residents who work at the Ol Kalou town quarry.She launched putting up of four sign boards, strategically positioned in Ol Kalou, to enable real and potential customers locate the quarry with ease."As a Nyandarua elected leader, I wish to state that we as the government need to have keen interest in this quarry due to the number of lives it support," Muhia said.The legislator said many quarry workers have been killed by terrorists in Madera. It would be wrong to run down quarries in Nyandarua and force youth to travel to other areas for the same work."If we allow our children to go to such a place yet God has endowed Nyandarua with resources such as this quarry, it would mean we don't care about the residents," she said.Muhia urged residents from Nyandarua, Kiambu and Nakuru counties to buy hand-cut stones from Ol Kalou town quarry because they are the best quality.She said she is willing to work with Governor Daniel Waithaka, Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho and Karau MCA Kamau Ngotho to find a lasting solution to the problems quarry workers face.
