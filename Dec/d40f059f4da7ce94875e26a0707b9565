The council of governors want the doctors held for contempt of court for defying the said order.Last week, Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Hellen Wasilwa declared the strike illegal and asked their unions to call it off.However, doctors vowed to continue downing their tools whilst nurses' talks though the Kenya National Union of Nurses were concluded.The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union has maintained that there will be no more discussions unless the Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2013 is implemented.The Council of Governors moved to court and obtained orders stopping the health workers' strike on December 2 after the health workers issued a 21-day strike notice.The health workers, through their union officials, however, claimed that they were never served with the case documents or order forcing the judge to ask the union leaders to appear before her to explain why they should not be punished for acting in contempt of court by calling on their members to participate in the strike.Doctors want a 300 per cent pay increase while nurses want a raise of 25 to 40 per cent, as well as allowances.
