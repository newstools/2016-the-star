Nasa's aim is to make Kenya great as its tribes are suffering, the opposition has said in response to the President's view that it is a tribal outfit with no agenda.Uhuru slammed opposition leaders Raila Odinga (Cord), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) at the reopening of the Pan Paper factory on Thursday."These people who call themselves leaders have no agenda for Kenyans. What they only know is to abuse me and my government and incite Kenyans to violence," he said.Read more: Dismiss 'tribal' NASA during 2017 poll, Uhuru tells Western residentsMore on this: NASA is a tribal outfit, says UhuruBut Mudavadi, who took campaigns deep into Maasailand on Friday, asked members of the community to join other Kenyans in voting Jubilee out to save the country.He said on the National Super Alliance belongs to Kenyans who want to reclaim their country from an era of misrule, corruption, inequality and lack of integrity.&ldquo;NASA has no agenda and time to create enemies. It is Jubilee leaders who dug themselves into a hole of lies and are still digging by lying to farmers who are saddled with debts and low prices for their produce, youth who cannot get employment for having wrong names as their parents are retrenched, public servants whose salary agreements Jubilee reneges on, Masaai herders who are harassed on their land, starving families who cannot afford high food prices, and projects whose launches are recycled," he said.&ldquo;NASA tribes are suffering. Starving families, disgruntled health workers, teachers and students are NASA."Further pointing out misappropriation of funds under Uhuru's rule, Mudavadi said generations of Kenyans will be destroyed if integrity is not restored in public service.&ldquo;NASA will be used to usher in leadership with integrity in the next elections," the Amani National Congress leader said and accused Jubilee Party of being on a mission to destroy the country through wanton corruption.He addressed at least 2,000 Morans who graduated in Kajiado Central, where he went with MPs Elijah Memusi (host), Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and Ayub Savula (Lugari).Uhuru said his coalition was achieving what opposition leaders had failed to while in government, but the Amani leader noted financial resources were being wasted.&ldquo;Jubilee is playing snooker with public resources. For every shilling spent on a project, nine shillings are stolen. But instead of being repentant, they brag about it&rdquo;, he said.&ldquo;These Jubilee fellows have the cowardly notion that running the government is waging war on opposition. That is politics, not governance."Mudavadi said he was confident he would win the top seat in 2017 and bring change, unlike the government, which he described as a regime of scandals and violation of the constitution.Masaai leaders who spoke at the function expressed "disgust" at the government's neglect and harassment.&ldquo;We have no roads and no water. We have been told we are worthless and are not needed... that our votes are meaningless," one said.Mudavadi praised the Masaai age set system as a culture that should be emulated at the national level.&ldquo;The Masaai culture of instilling discipline and mentoring leaders on responsibility should be emulated,&rdquo; he said.Read: Do not force Maasai to join Jubilee Party, Narok MP saysAlso read: Maasai to remain in Jubilee as Ntimama wished, says Nkaissery
