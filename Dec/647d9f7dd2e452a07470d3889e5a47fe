Kenya is struggling in the war against corruption because it is a capitalist nation where those in power concentrate on amassing wealth, Chama Cha Uzalendo national chairman Maur Bwanamaka has said.He said the country&rsquo;s economic system is based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Bwanamaka on Wednesday said this has made leaders greedy and made it difficult to prosecute those found culpable of graft offences.&ldquo;They own tools of production, so they can decide which zone to concentrate on at the expense of others,&rdquo; he said. He said the solution to ending runaway corruption is to change the system to socialism.
