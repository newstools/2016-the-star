ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya on Sunday will preside over a fundraiser for Kibra elders to enable them to venture into viable and sustainable income-generating projects. The event has been organised by MP hopeful Eliud Owallo. It will be at the Kamkunji Grounds in Kibra from 10am. This comes two weeks after youths heckled Nyayo Highrise MCA Maurice Akuk during an event presided over by Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. The event turned chaotic after youths carted away all the water tanks donated to them, damaging some. Kidero had to calm them. Governor Oparanya will be assisted by Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti. Other expected guests are Senator Janet Ong era, Busia MP Florence Mutua and professionals from the private sector based both locally and abroad. Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa will be the MC.
