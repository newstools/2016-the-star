Former Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala has told incumbent Ababu Namwamba to stop meddling in the affairs of the Jubilee Party, saying he should concentrate on his Labour Party.Speaking to the Star on the phone on Wednesday, he said he is the one who invited President Uhuru Kenyatta to launch key projects in Budalang'i tomorrow.Wanjala, Nzoia Sugar Company director, said Ababu should stop behaving as if he is closer to Uhuru than him. &ldquo;I invited Uhuru in my capacity as a Jubilee Party member, so I fail to understand why Namwamba is fighting me over the issue,&rdquo; he said.Wanjala said the President will commission the construction of Sigiri bridge, launch Sisenye rice irrigation scheme and unveil tractors. He said he invited Uhuru to Budalang'i in 2013 to console the families of those who perished in the River Nzoia boat tragedy."Namwamba invited Deputy President William Ruto for a fundraiser in Budalang'i recently but I did interfere with him, why is he meddling in Jubilee Party affairs?" Wanjala said.Addressing mourners during a burial in Bwokhola village, Bunyala West, on Wednesday, Namwamba urged Wanjala to stop spreading rumours that Uhuru and Ruto will visit Budalang'i today. Namwamba urged constituents not to be misled by the false information spread through loud speakers on Monday. He said he and Bunyala deputy county commissioner Simon Ng&rsquo;etich are still awaiting official communication from State House controller Lawrence Lenayapa on when Uhuru will visit Budalang'i.
