Bomet residents have vowed to send home their Governor Isaac Rutto, saying he no longer represents their interests.The residents led by Chepalungu MP Paul Bii &ldquo;Savimbi&rdquo;, made the declaration at Chebunyo trading centre where President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the tarmacking of a crucial road that will be extended to serve the counties of Bomet, Narok and Transmara.The road &ndash; which runs from Daraja Sita through Chebole, Labotiet, Chebunyo, Emurua to Dikirr &ndash; is being upgraded to bitumen standards at a cost of Sh 2 billion.President Uhuru pointed out that the electorate want leaders who will uplift their lives by initiating development and not those who oppose it.The President emphasized Jubilee&rsquo;s all-inclusive approach to development, saying the main target is to unite the country and accelerate progress but not to create rifts among leaders.&ldquo;You voted and put us in office so that we will work and improve your lives but not to engage in issues that will hold us back and slow down implementation of development projects,&rdquo; President Uhuru said.The Head of State said politics should not be allowed to block implementation of projects meant to benefit Kenyans.Deputy President William Ruto said the people of Bomet county are enlightened and will not gamble with their lives by voting for people who are not development-conscious in the next general elections.&ldquo;What type of a leader are you if you can rush to court to block improvement of roads, installation of medical equipment in hospitals and construction of a university,&rdquo; the Deputy President said.By a show of hands, the residents assured the President and his deputy that they will walk with the Jubilee Party in 2017, the same way they did in 2013.The President and his deputy were accompanied by a host of leaders from Bomet County and beyond who included Senators Wilfred Lesan (Bomet), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Deputy Governor Stephen Mutai (Bomet), Bomet Women Representative Cecilia Ngetich and Narok Governor Samuel Tunai among others.President Uhuru&ndash; who was on the last leg of his three-day tour of the North and South Rift which saw him visit Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Kericho and Bomet &ndash;to launch development projects &ndash; was later scheduled to address wananchi in Bomet town before launching medical equipment at Longisa County Hospital.On Friday, the President flagged off the tarmacking of the Tengecha &ndash; Koiwa &ndash; Kaptebeng&rsquo;wet and Koiwa &ndash; Cheptalal &ndash; Sotik &ndash;Kaptebeng&rsquo;wet &ndash; Chebangang &ndash; Kimulot &ndash; Changoi roads in Bomet county that will be upgraded at a cost of Sh 2.26 billion.In Kericho county, President Uhuru launched the construction of close to 200 kilometres of tarmacked roads on Friday.
