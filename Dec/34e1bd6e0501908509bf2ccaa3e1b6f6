The high cost of land compensation, low contractor capacity and vandalism were the major challenges in infrastructure development in 2016, the State Department for Infrastructure has said.These coupled with encroachment on public land slowed down road projects across the country, Principal Secretary John Mosonik said. This happened even as the government moved to develop roads to increase access to ports and airports in a bid to support agriculture, tourism and manufacturing industries, and to decongest urban areas. Programmes undermined include the 10,000km low-volume traffic roads aimed at improving access to social amenities, reduce travel costs, cut vehicle operating costs, and enhance rural connectivity and development.&ldquo;A total of 2,327km across 30 counties are under construction, while additional 25,000km are under evaluation and will be launched early next year to cover other counties,&rdquo; said Mosonik in a 2016 outlook report.He said inadequate financing has hurt infrastructure projects since they heavily depend on the exchequer and development partner funding. &ldquo;Due to increased fiscal obligation and competing needs on the exchequer, the funds allocated to the roads sub-sector have been inadequate, and the projects suffered from implementation challenges including cost overruns, late completion, and high interests on delayed payments among others,&rdquo; Mosonik said.He said notable progress has, however, been made in the development and maintenance of the infrastructure sector, where the classified road network stands at 161,453km out of which 16,302km are paved to bitumen standards.&ldquo;So far, the department through its agencies has delivered an additional 2,302km of paved road network in the last three years. This implies an average of 767km has been delivered per year for the last three years,&rdquo; Mosonik said. Some of the major completed projects in the period under review include the Merille river-Marsabit road, Marsabit-Turbi road, Turbi-Moyale road, Voi&ndash;Mwatate and Mwatate&ndash;Taveta (A23 ). Others are Nairobi southern bypass, Mau Summit-Kericho, Kericho-Nyamasaria, Upper Hill and Chuka town roads. Mosonik said 3,784km of roads are under construction, while 2,985km are planned for next year. Among major ongoing works that will be completed next year include Loruk-Barpelo, Webuye-kitale, Bachuma gate maji ya chumvi and Outering road.
