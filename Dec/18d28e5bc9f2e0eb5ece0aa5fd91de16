The Appeals Court yesterday cleared the way for the arrest of Nyandarua County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti for failure to appear before the Employment Court.He had not honoured a court order to appear and comply with its order to reinstate sacked Kipiriri chief Lucy Wangari.Yesterday, the Court of Appeal in Nairobi dismissed the Attorney General&rsquo;s bid to block Kimiti&rsquo;s arrest.The three-judge bench &mdash; Justices Roselyne Nambuye, Patrick Kiyage and Hannah Okwengu &mdash; dismissed the AG&rsquo;s appeal, citing anomalies in the application.The bench said the AG should amend it. Kiyage said the notice of appeal by the respondents contained errors and the application was unclear. He said the motion was filed late.Justice Stephen Radido of the Employment and Labour Relations Court issued an arrest order against the commissioner for failing to appear. Appearing before the three-judge bench, the AG&rsquo;s counsel cited bias by the Employment court in issuing the arrest order. Nguyo said Wangari was fairly dismissed over claims of gross misconduct as a public servant and the commissioner was mandated to remove her. She sued the county commissioner, the Interior CS, the Public Service Commission and the AG for unfair dismissal.
