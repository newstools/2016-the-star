Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are (pictured) has sued the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for not cracking a whip on politicians engaged in premature campaigns.Mong&rsquo;are wants the IEBC compelled to publish a list of all errant parties and candidates who have embarked on early campaigns before the official kickoff. He said they are committing electoral offences.In an urgent application filed at the High Court yesterday, Mong&rsquo;are said the IEBC should penalise politicians who have contravened the elections laws and the electoral code of conduct.Among the leaders Mong&rsquo;are wants punished include Cord leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua and senators Hassan Omar and Boni Khalwale. He said they have embarked on early campaigns in contravention of the electoral Act.&ldquo;I am apprehensive and fearful that as we are heading into the election period, a section of parties may be sidelined as others have started early campaigns,&rdquo; Mong&rsquo;are said.Through his lawyer Zachary Mwambi, the senator said due to early campaigns, supporters of a number of governors, senators and MPs have clashed.&ldquo;The IEBC has failed to be transparent and accountable in managing the political affairs in the country and laying a foundation of fair elections,&rdquo; Mwambi said.He says the early campaigns have led to rising political temperatures and the court should direct the commission to prohibit early campaigns.
