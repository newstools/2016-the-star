Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo has moved to court seeking anticipatory bail pending possible arrest for remarks against the President in a heated address at Parliament on Tuesday.Millie said in her petition that she also wants the DPP and the Inspector General of Police stopped from arresting her pending the hearing and determination of her application.The MP further said that she has living in fear as security agents have issued threats against her.Millie said, through her lawyer Anthony Oluoch, that she was confronted by police officers who threatened her with detention and unspecified offenses.She added that she has also received numerous threats from unknown people who have made phone calls, saying they will have her arrested and detained.The legislator described herself as traumatised and undergoing psychological torture "arising from thinly veiled threats" directed at her.She said she has been vilified for lawfully and constitutionally exercising her rights and freedoms.Millie on Tuesday asked Uhuru to stop harassing Kenyans by barring MPs from accessing parliament for the special sitting."I dedicated this day to telling the President all the negative things I have. We fought for this country as he was in foreign land so President Uhuru cannot dictate his powers to me or any other elected member," she also stated."Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is a fake President as his own backyard is poor. We have come here prepared for death and we are going to Canaan not back to Egypt."More on this: [VIDEO] Kenyans react to Millie Odhiambo's remarks that Uhuru is 'a fake President'Read: Uhuru responds to Millie Odhiambo with a Christmas cardBut Cord leader Raila Odinga defended the MP saying she was motivated by the protection of the people's rights and should not be punished.He also noted that Uhuru called him a "mad man" during his tour of former Central Province two weeks ago but that he did not take any action.Read: Millie Odhiambo fighting to save Kenya, Raila says, Kiambu group demands apologyAlso read: Moses Kuria threatens to assault Millie Odhiambo with broken bottle for insulting Uhuru
