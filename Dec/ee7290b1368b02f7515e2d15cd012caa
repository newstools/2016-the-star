Garissa police are investigating an MCA for allegedly breaking into the county secretary&rsquo;s office on Thursday last week. Witnesses said Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi broke the door to Mohamud Mursal&rsquo;s office after he became impatient after being kept waiting for hours. Area police boss Aaron Moriasi said no arrest has been made. Witnesses said Mursal was in a meeting with officials, including Finance chief officer Hassan Bashir, popularly known as Hamarey.&ldquo;Before those inside knew what was happening, the door fell inwards, resulting in an exchange of abusive words between the MCA and the county officials,&rdquo; one witness said.In a clip shared on social media, voices of the officials trading insults can be heard. Office utensils, including thermos bottles, cups, and glasses, were broken, and files strewn all over as Abdi and Mursal kicked and hit each other.Regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh&rsquo;s office is located at the county headquarters. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officials, who happened to be at the scene for another reason, reportedly have taken over the matter. Apart from impatience, it is not clear what might have prompted the fracas.
