Private schools&rsquo; owners have been urged to invest in a new system of education to be launched soon.Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka said the system, which seeks to replace the current 8-4-4, will be expensive to implement. But it is the only option private schools&rsquo; proprietors can maximise on, he added.Waithaka spoke on Wednesday in Ol-Kalou, where he addressed members of the Kenya Private Schools&rsquo; Association, Nyandarua chapter, during their AGM. He said the system, which will comprise early, middle and senior schools, will improve academics.Waithaka said the county has built 166 ECDE classrooms. Construction of 55 others is ongoing, he said.Nyandarua will start a school feeding programme soon to encourage many children to enrol and remain in school.Waithaka, a heavy investor in private schools, said the government is improving roads to ensure accessibility to learning institutions.
