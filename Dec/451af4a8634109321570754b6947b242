President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto "are guilty of serious economic crimes" and must be brought to account, Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire has said.The ODM treasurer said Kenyans will not forgive the two top Jubilee leaders for leading "a widespread and massive economic onslaught against them."He said on Wednesday that they have panicked for fear of an election defeat in next year's general election."Jubilee will have to be brought to bear and answer for the economic crimes it has committed," he said without giving details. "After [a leadership] change it will not be business as usual, for those who have committed crimes will be brought to bear."Leaders and members of the public have complained about the many corruption scandals that have arisen under the Jubilee administration.These include the Sh250 billion Eurobond scandal and the alleged theft of Sh5.3 billion from the Health ministry, that ODM leader Raila Odinga has often spoken about.Raila has called for investigations and prosecution of those guilty and said Kenya needs a change of rule. But Uhuru has asked him to stop the negative criticism and insisted that he has done everythign in his power, as compared to past leaders, to curb the vice.Read: Raila warns investors over second Eurobond,asks state to account for missing Sh215 billionAlso read: I have played my part in corruption fight &ndash;UhuruBosire, a frequent critic of Uhuru and Ruto, said the wave to send Jubilee home is unstoppable because Kenyans have resolved to join hands to change the regime."Kenyans want to save their country and save the limited public resources for better livelihoods," he said in an interview with the Star.Regarding the International Criminal Court, Bosire said Uhuru's push for Kenya to reconsider its association was ill-advised.The President said, during Jamhuri Day celebrations on Monday, that the country must consider withdrawing from The Hague-based court because the tribunal is biased and targets Africans.But the MP said: "Any attempt to withdraw Kenya from the ICC will be resisted because it is an attempt to withdraw into a cage where evil will flourish. We shall never tolerate this."Read: Foreigners plotting regime change in Kenya - UhuruBosire termed as a sign pf panic, the President's claims that foreigners are funding programmes with the intention of influencing the outcome of the 2017 polls."...To the extent that the President is trying to tell Kenyans that the world is out to fund the opposition and not the government. This is neither here nor there. It is a sign of panic," he said.He noted that amid widespread systems of bad leadership and misuse of public resources, Kenyans are willing to go to any length, constitutionally, to change the regime."Any civilised mind ready to contribute to change in Kenya, for purposes of benefiting everybody and the world, is welcome," he said.Raila has often said that the Jubilee administration should be held responsible for rampant corruption in the country.More on this: Take responsibility on corruption matters, Raila tells UhuruRegarding the ICC, the Cord leader said on Tuesday that Uhuru and Ruto were pitied and should thank the court for not barring them from vying in the 2013 general election."The President and his DP were only allowed to vie by the ICC out of pity. They should not dare pull the nation out of the court," he said.More on this: [AUDIO] ICC pitied you, Raila tells Uhuru during Wiper NDC
