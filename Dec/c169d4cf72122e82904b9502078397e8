President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the Education ministry to put in place effective plans to institutionalise the ongoing reforms in the sector to ensure sustainability and entrenchment.He said there is no room for sliding back on the reforms, saying no effort should be spared in ensuring the ministry moves to the next parts of the sector to safeguard proper utilisation of exchequer resources, eradicate wastage and bureaucratic inertia that often lead to failure in the achievement of set targets.The President directed Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to speed up the implementation of the Education Information Management System to ensure education data is accurate, current and available to facilitate accurate decision-making and deployment of resources.He also ordered the ministry and all its partners and agencies, including the Teachers Service Commission, to ensure they complete a comprehensive digitisation of all their records and programmes within the next one year.Uhuru spoke when he received a comprehensive report of this year&rsquo;s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam from the ministry and the Kenya National Examinations Council ahead of the release of the results.Uhuru encouraged those who sat the exam, saying whatever results they get, there is still hope and it is possible to make it to their careers of choice. He said although there was a significant drop in performance compared to the previous year, the results by and large posited a normal performance curve.
