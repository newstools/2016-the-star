Rendeavour, the developer of multi-billion-shilling Tatu City project in Kiambu,has called on the 47 counties to enhance efficiencies in enforcement of contracts to boost investments. Chief executive Stephen Jennings said despite the country's investment climate generally improving in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report published in October, enforcement of contracts remained largely unchanged. &ldquo;Efficient contract enforcement is critical for the business climate because it contributes to economic development by reducing costs, delays and uncertainty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; It also improves access to credit and increases trade. Foreign Direct Investment and investor confidence in a county are influenced directly by the enforceability of contracts in that jurisdiction and this is where the government should lay more emphasis going forward.&rdquo;
