Some Garissa leaders, led by Governor Nathif Jama, have threatened to move to court over the Equalisation Fund.Speaking to the press in Garissa town yesterday, the leaders said there are no clear guidelines on how the kitty will be managed at both the national and county level.The governor's comments come four days after the county government rejected the proposed projects by the Equalisation Fund Board.The county said it was a duplication of projects already in the County Integrated Development Plan.County secretary Mohamud Mursal said until the board consults the National Assembly, they cannot allow the proposed projects to go ahead.The board visited the county on Thursday last week. Jama said it is important for all players to identify the real issues for the specific areas the fund was supposed to address."We will obtain an injunction because we want all the 14 marginalised counties to benefit. The best way is not to quarrel with the MPs. I want us to agree so that we do what is right for our people," he said.Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey said the debate on the kitty has not been exhaustive and there is need for all the counties, through a special committee, to iron out the issues."The counties should come together and interrogate the issues. This kitty will not be of any assistance if it is not agreeable to all the 14 affected counties," he said.Amey said farmers will also move to court to stop the board from using the fund.He said the current funds should go into livestock, agriculture, and drought programmes in the 14 counties reeling from the effects of the recent dry spell."Some of these counties have not recovered from the devastating drought. Let this year's funds go into restoring the livelihoods of our farmers and herders first before we talk of any other projects," Amey said.
