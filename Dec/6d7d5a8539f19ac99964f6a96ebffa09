Christopher Khaemba, the Nairobi County Executive for Lands, heads probably the most challenging docket within the county government.The sector has historically been riddled with protracted cases of land grabbing and irregular approval of construction leading to collapse of buildings in the capital.Khaemba says the measures and actions he has taken since he was appointed to the docket have transformed the sector.&ldquo;We now have a law- the Regularisation of Development Act - that ensures that all developers who construct houses without approvals are given a window to acquire the permits,&rdquo; he says.A team has been put up to scrutinize applications and inspect the buildings to ensure they are sound for human habitation.&ldquo;We also have a multi-agency team comprising the NCA, Ministry of Public Works, Nairobi County and other bodies who are currently auditing all the residential houses in the county. Buildings that will be judged to be unsafe are being brought down and so far upwards of 50 buildings, most of them in Huruma estate, have been brought down. ,&rdquo; he says.However shortage of equipment and insecurity in some of the estates have slowed down the exercise.Khaemba is also proud of successfully steering the development and introduction of an electronic construction permit system-Electronic Development Permit Management System, (e-DPMS) to end malpractices and &lsquo;shortcut&rsquo; processing of construction documents.The application allows the developers, architects and engineers to electronically submit construction applications. It reduces approval time from six months to four weeks.The executive says the county is digitizing all land records using Geographic Information System technology, a project funded by the World Bank.This, he says, will end multiple allocation of the same land which has been has been a major cause of land disputes in the capital.Khaemba who was earlier in charge Education, Youth Affairs and Social Services at the city county, served for 10 years as Principal of Alliance Boy&rsquo;s High School.He steered the school back to first position in the national academic rankings and expanded enrolment by 25 per cent.&ldquo;I am on record for having produced the best Mathematics and physics results in the country,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I made a personal decision that no boy who came to Alliance would leave the school on account of inability to pay fees.&rdquo;****1960: Born in Bungoma County1967: Starts schooling at Kamukuywa Primary School until 1972 when he did his CPE1973: He then moved to Maseno School for his secondary education, eventually sitting for his O levels in 1976.1980: Was recruited in the military and served as a member of Kenya Air Force for five years.1984: Recruited to Alliance High School to teach mathematics and physics.

We are short of land to bury our people. We have agreed with the governor that he land must remain as cemetery land though I am told it was allocated to some private developer. I have asked for details of who allocated it and to which developer and when the same was done. Not only is it anti-social, it is unheard of to disturb the spirits of those who are resting in peace.&rdquo;2016: &ldquo;In developing our schools, we spoke to hundreds of CEOs and leaders around the world to better understand what young people need to succeed in the 21st century.
