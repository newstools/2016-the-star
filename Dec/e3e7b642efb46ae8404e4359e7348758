Two ODM aspirants for the Kanduyi MP seat have promised to engage each other in &lsquo;&rsquo;friendly fire&rsquo;&rsquo; ahead of the party nominations. Both Bungoma speaker John Makali and lawyer Edwin Sifuna want to unseat MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. The two politicians, who appear to enjoy the same popularity both on social media and on the ground, have said they will not allow their supporters to fight. They said they will work together as members from the same party. The hopefuls spoke on Tuesday at Centrica Hotel, Bungoma town, during an ODM meeting that was attended by party deputy leader Wycliffe Oparanya. &lsquo;&rsquo;I have seen what residents want and I promise to serve them diligently,&rdquo; Makali said. Sifuna said they will work together to ensure they send Wamuniyi home for &ldquo;failing&rdquo; Kanduyi residents. &lsquo;&rsquo;You all know how it happens in friendly fire &mdash; you do not hit the head but you hit the legs,&rdquo; he said.
