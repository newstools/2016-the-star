The Mombasa government has suffered a major and costly blow after the High Court barred it from collecting revenue from facilities around Kenya Ferry Services.Sitting in Mombasa, judge Mathew Emukule on Monday directed the county to refund KFS millions of shillings for loss of revenue after it unlawfully took over the services last February.It must repay revenue lost to the state, compensation at about Sh2.5 per month and Sh1.5 million penalty for every month of late repayment. The respondent s actions to take over the arbitrary activities, powers, duties and obligations of the Kenya Ferry Services were unlawful and inconsistent with the Ferries Act Chapter 4, he said.Emukule ordered the county government to hand over the operations of the Likoni Channel Crossing, together with all the ancillary facilities within two weeks.KFS moved to court saying a law by the county allowing it to collect the revenue running into millions was unconstitutional.The payment is to be made from the date of the judgment, with interest of Sh1.5 million every month of delay.KFS got a reprieve after the court ordered the county to stop operations at the Likoni ancillary facilities mainland ramp.BILL INCONSISTENTEmukule further declared the proposed Mombasa Ports Harbours Bill 2014 inconsistent with the provisions of Articles 201 and 209 ( 5 ) of the Constitution.He ordered Mombasa to pay KFS the costs caused by the unlawful takeover..The court also ordered compensation at an average rate of Sh2,580,000 per month as a result of lost revenue. This involves vehicles, tuk-tuks and motorcycles using KFS landing facilities and terminus.Last week, the county renewed its battle with the Kenya Ports Authority to control the port and the annual Sh35.6 billion collected at the harbour. Governor Hassan Joho said the county will sue. The KPA is one of the government s biggest income earners.Joho on Friday said Mombasa receives peanuts in annual allocations from the Treasury. It has received Sh14 billion in four years, he said.On Thursday, the governor said Mombasa s economy has been sabotaged and residents deprived of resources by the national government. He said KPA proceeds are channelled into the wrong hands.The battle is expected to flare up after completion of the standard gauge railway because it will multiply KPA s annual revenues the county wants.Joho said, It is time to go to court over the revenue share with the port. Let them [KPA] prepare for a battle. In November 2015, Mombasa MCAs compelled the national government to hand over KFS to the county.The county had been discussing how to take over the management and daily operations.Presenting the notice in the assembly, Transport Committee chairman Amur Murfad said the Likoni and Mtongwe Ferry Services are managed and operated by the national government, which is a function of the county government.He said non-involvement of the county government in the management and operation of the ferries, not only violates the Constitution, but also has exacerbated the frequent problems at the ferries.Murfad urged the county ment to explore ways to fully taking over the ferry management and operations.The county government has been seeking full control of the KFS, which is a limited company.Eighty per cent of the company is owned by the national government, while 20 per cent belongs to the Kenya Ports Authority.
