National Olympic Committee&ndash;Kenya first vice chairman Bernard Ekumbo finally got a reprieve yesterday after a court released him on cash bail pending trial.The besieged Noc-k official who has been in custody since his dramatic arrest on November 21, was allowed by Senior Principal Magistrate Charity Oluoch to pay Sh200,000 to secure his release after his lawyer Cliff Ombeta renewed his bail application.Last week the court had declined to release him on bail after the prosecution informed court that they were investigating allegations of child molestation made against him by several minors.&ldquo;Since there is an ongoing probe and there is a likelihood of more charges being preferred against the accused I will deny him bail for now,&rdquo; Joyce Gadani had ruled.However, yesterday the prosecution was not opposed to his release on bail even though Duncan Ondimu said police were yet to complete investigations.&ldquo;We are asking court that he be warned against interfering with witnesses at the Kenya Swimming Federation,&rdquo; prosecutor Ondimu added.Ekumbo , who is also the deputy chairman of Noc-k will now be tried alongside Noc-k secretary general Francis Kinyiri Paul, vice-chairman Pius Ochieng and assistant treasurer Stephen arap Soi.The prosecution yesterday applied to have the three official&rsquo;s gagged saying they were interfering with witnesses. Ondimu told court the three called a meeting at Noc-k offices and threatened to sack employees who would testify against them.&ldquo;We want the three to be ordered to appear before the CID and record statements over the allegations,&rdquo; Ondimu told court but the application was rejected.Ekumbo is facing charges of stealing money and sports kits intended for the team at the Rio Olympic Games.He is accused of stealing Sh1m($10,500) and the uniforms but he has denied the allegations.Last week, Ekumbo told the court the cash was deposited into his bank account without his knowledge while he was already in Brazil, and said he was willing to refund all the money.Ochieng, Kanyiri and Soi are accused of stealing Sh25million and kit meant for athletes.The officials were arrested on their return from Rio at the end of August over their roles in the alleged mismanagement of the Kenyan team's preparations for the Games.Noc-k was disbanded on August 25 by Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario following public pressure. The CS&rsquo;s decision however has been challenged in court and the matter is still pending.
