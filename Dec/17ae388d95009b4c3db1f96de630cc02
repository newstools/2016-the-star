Some Jubilee officials in Mombasa want President Uhuru Kenyatta to resolve squabbles and infighting in the party.Uhuru, who arrived in the coastal town on Christmas Eve, has maintained a low profile. He has not met any leaders, although some officials plan to pay him a visit. Two weeks ago, the JP elections were marred by violence at the Kenya School of Government in Kizingo, forcing riot police to intervene.A faction led by businessman Suleiman Shahbal and another led by lawyer Ananiah Mwaboza are fighting to control the party.Mwaboza&rsquo;s camp accuses Shahbal of trying to impose his own officials to help him win the JP ticket for Mombasa governor. Both Shahbal and Mwaboza seek JP endorsement to run against Governor Hassan Joho of ODM. Shahbal is Uhuru&rsquo;s point man at the Coast, while Mwaboza is a legal adviser in Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s office.
