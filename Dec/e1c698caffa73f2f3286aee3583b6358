The Senate is expected to reconvene on Wednesday for a special sitting to debate and either pass or reject amendments to Electoral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016.Senate majority leader Kindiki Kithure yesterday confirmed that the senators currently on recess will be required in the House.&ldquo;Senators will consider, debate and either pass or reject the amendments,&rdquo; he said on the phone. Jubilee enjoys majority status in the Senate and is therefore likely to carry the day as it happened in the National Assembly on Thursday.The Senate consists of 47 members directly elected by their counties, 16 women nominated by the political parties according to their relative strength in the Senate elections, two members to represent the youth, and two members to represent persons with disability.Because the laws affect counties, it means only the 47 elected senators will vote to approve or reject the amendments.Key among the amendments that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries is pushing for is the enactment of a provision allowing the commission to manually identify and transmit results where electronic gadgets fail in the August 8 election.The amendments which have been opposed by Cord require the IEBC to put in place an alternative and complementary mechanism for identification and transmission of election results that is simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent.The bill states that before the Ezra Chiloba-led commission resorts to using the alternative mechanisms for identification and transmission of election results, it will be required to notify the public and all candidates and immediately cause the notification to be published in the electronic media and in at least two daily newspapers of national circulation, detailing reasons.&rdquo;
