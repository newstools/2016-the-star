A section of nurses has walked out of the signing of the recognition agreement between county governments and their union, citing lack of seriousness.The CoG, said to currently be in a closed-door meeting, had also invited striking doctors for fresh talks beginning Wednesday.Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said they walked out because the council seemed to have decided not to sign the deal.Panyako said they expected to begin the meeting with the signing but that they were instead given terms for calling off the strike.He said they were asked to call off the strike before the agreement could be signed, a condition he termed a "waste of time"."We expected to sign all documents and hopefully resume work today but it seems very tricky. We will not resume work under unfavourable terms even if it means going to jail," he said.He noted he was also willing to die in pursuit of the fulfillment of the health workers' demands.The bargain offered nurses an annual payout of Sh20,000 for those between Job groups G-L and Sh15,000 for nurses in Job Groups M and above.Sixty per cent of it will be paid in January next year and the remainder on July 1 next year.Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said the pay rise will cost the government Sh7 billion annually.More on this: Infighting rocks nurses union as top organ insists strike still onPanyako noted that the ministry agreed that the deal was impractical and that governors were to be consulted before they could be updated.But he noted: "Before close of business today the nurses strike might be brought to an end."Nurses had called off their week-long strike after their union struck a return-to -work formula with the government.KNUN chairman John Bii said on Sunday that they were ready to resume work immediately.This came just hours after close to 40 people lost their lives when a canter carrying inflammable chemical exploded near Naivasha."We have decided not to hold the country at ransom because we got part of the bargain we were pushing for. So we are going to restore nursing services across the country," he said.More on this: Nurses call off strike after signing deal with stateBut Panyako dismissed the deal saying it was not legally binding as the union officials who signed it usurped his powers and those of the union&rsquo;s governing council.&ldquo;The strike is still on. I am the only person mandated by the nurses union to call of the strike under authorisation from the governing council,&rdquo; he noted.Read more: Panyako dismisses deal with government, says nurses strike is still on
