The Murang&rsquo;a government has not tarmacked any road, despite getting Sh21 billion in four years, Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said. Infrastructural development has been slow due to misappropriation of resources, the governor aspirant added. &ldquo;With the CDF we have tarmacked 11 roads in Kigumo, but it is a pity that the county government, despite garnering a huge chunk of the national cake, has not tarmacked even a single inch of road,&rdquo; Kamau said. He spoke on Monday in Kigumo while launching the tarmacking of the 4.5km Gachocho-Gathera road. It will cost Sh80 million. Kamau said out of 2,300km of road in Murang&rsquo;a, only 500km are tarmacked. Construction of more roads would have unlocked the county&rsquo;s growth potential, he said. The MP said that improving the road network should have been a priority as Murang&rsquo;a is an agricultural county and good roads ease transport of produce.
