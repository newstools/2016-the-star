Two leaders from Western Kenya have urged the Senate to reject the controversial electoral bill passed by the National Assembly last week.&ldquo;Kenyans are banking on the 47 elected senators to offer them post-Christmas and New Year gift by rejecting the Elections (Amendment) Bill ( 2016 ),&rdquo; Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi said.He asked senators to block the bill, saying if passed into law it might wreak havoc in the country. Jubilee MPs endorsed the contentious bill even after their Cord counterparts walked out of Parliament in protest.Mudavadi spoke at Buchenya stadium in Butere during the finals of Tindi Mwale tournament played last Sunday.Maendeleo Democratic Party secretary general Martin Andati said the public did not participate in drafting the bill, adding its passage might spark violence.Andati, who is also a political analyst, urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to assent to the bill if passed by the Senate, saying he should instead call for dialogue on how Kenyans will vote in the event biometric system fails.The MDP boss asked Jubilee MPs in the Senate not to ride on the tyranny of numbers, but rather consider the effect the law will have on millions of the Kenyans.&ldquo;Kenya is bigger than Uhuru and Ruto. It is bigger than Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi, Wetang&rsquo;ula and others,&rdquo; he said during MDP forum at Sabatia in Butere on Tuesday.Andati asked Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro to consult before debating the bill and called on the private sector, media and civil society members to reject it.
