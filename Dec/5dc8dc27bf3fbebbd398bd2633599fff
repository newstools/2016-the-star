Kwale senator Boy Juma Boy has declared to vote against the amended electoral laws when they come for debate in the August House on Wednesday.He accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of bulldozing MPs to change the laws in disregard of the recommendations of the 14-member joint parliament committee.Accompanied by Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori and Kwale speaker Sammy Ruwa, he said the amendment to the laws are attempts to rig the 2017 general election."As ODM and CORD, we are opposed to the amendments. When they will be brought to the Senate, I will vote NO. Take that message to Uhuru," he said.Dori said that what happened in parliament during the passing of the amendments was clear manifestation of dictatorship by the Jubilee administration.He said they have a fear for the common mwananchi following the "humiliating treatment given to MPs" during the debate on the contentious law."If Jubilee gets one vote from Msambweni, I will be ready to resign after being elected. We don&rsquo;t want Jubilee in Mswambweni," he said.On his part, Speaker Sammy Ruwa, who is eyeing Kwale governor seat, said that Jubilee leadership cannot be trusted.He took issue with the government&rsquo;s failure to tackle corruption in the country, and "therefore need to be sent home". &ldquo;The president stood and said he cannot do anything about corruption. Why should we give him a second term and he has failed in the first term? We have not given Raila and failed, let&rsquo;s not play around," he said.The leaders spoke at a time the president has been urged not to assent to the amendments.Church leaders, governors, and several political parties have opposed the changes citing that they are a recipe for chaos.Cord leader Raila Odinga has called their supporters to mass action on January 4 in case the laws are assented to.Read: Raila gives Uhuru nine-day ultimatum on election laws, says demos a last resortAlso read: Atwoli tells Senate, Uhuru to reject amended election laws
