The government has extended the dusk-to-dawn curfew in Mandera county by three months starting today. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery yesterday said the order remains effective until March 28, 2017. He said the directive aims to improve efforts to deal with terrorism. Nkaissery said the curfew will be observed in Mandera Town, Omar, Jillo, Arabia, Fino, Lafey, Kotulo and its environs up to 20km from the Kenya-Somalia border. The government had in October declared a one-month curfew in the county. Nkaissery at that time said the order applied to every person except under special conditions of a written permit granted by the respective deputy county commissioner. &ldquo;Remain indoors and in such other premises as may be authorised,&rdquo; read part of the legal notice. The curfew came after al Shabaab militants attacked the Bishaaro Guest House in Mandera town, killing 12 people and seriously injuring six others. According to sources, Nkaissery decided to extend the curfew after more terrorists were arrested in November. So far, more than 60 people had been arrested and charged with violating the order. The latest arrest was at Border Point One where 11 suspects were nabbed.
