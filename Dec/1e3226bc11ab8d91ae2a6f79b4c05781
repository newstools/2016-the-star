Mt Elgon MP John Serut, a big critic of Jubilee, shocked many when he joined the Jubilee Party on Thursday during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s tour.He said he will run for reelection on the JP ticket, as it is the most popular party in Mt Elgon. Serut was elected as an independent candidate in 2013. Initially, the MP accused Jubilee and former administrations of neglecting Mt Elgon residents since Independence.The legislator said the region has lagged behind in development, it has poor roads, neglected schools, few teachers, insecurity and poor mobile network.On Thursday, Uhuru commissioned the construction of the Kopsiro Road and issued more than 2,000 title deeds to Chepyuk squatters. He promised to do more for the region.Political analysts see Serut&rsquo;s move as a win for the Jubilee Party in Bungoma county.Five Bungoma MPs have joined Jubilee. They are Serut, Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula, Webuye West&rsquo;s Dan Wanyama, Sirisia&rsquo;s John Waluke and Bungoma woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi.Serut asked Webuye East MP Alfred Sambu to join Jubilee as it will form the next government.&ldquo;If I have come out of opposition, who else is remaining in Bungoma? We want you all to come to Jubilee and help form the next government because our people are tired of being in the cold,&rdquo; he said.
