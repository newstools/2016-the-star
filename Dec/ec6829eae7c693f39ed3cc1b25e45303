Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s one-time close ally speaker Thadius Rajwayi has switched allegiance and now supports his arch-rival &ndash; Nyali MP Hezron Awiti for the county&rsquo;s top seat. &ldquo;Where there is smoke, there is fire. Expect an inferno and real fights in 2017. We know who has already lost. Whether they like it or not, we are going to take over. I wish Awiti all the best. I&rsquo;m here pledging my loyalty to him,&rdquo; Rajwayi said on Sunday. He spoke after a service at Ushindi Baptist Church in Likoni. Awiti was present. It has been six months since Rajwayi was barred from presiding over assembly sittings. Critics have blamed Joho for instigating Rajwayi&rsquo;s sacking, though the matter is pending in court. In an indirect reference to Joho, Rajwayi compared unnamed leaders to farmers who pluck feathers from their poultry and only feed them when they are on the brink of death. After MCAs allied to Joho attempted to sack him, Rajwayi said people from his community are being targeted. Sources say Joho pushed for the sacking, a claim he denies. Rajwayi said a major leadership declaration will be made next year. Many Luos are said to support Rajwayi. The turn of events could threaten Joho&rsquo;s reelection. The majority of Luos voted for him in 2013. Joho&rsquo;s think tanks are said to be strategising how to win. In October, Awiti said Joho is criss-crossing the country &ldquo;pretending&rdquo; to popularise ODM, but his real motive is is to woo Luos in Mombasato voting for him.
