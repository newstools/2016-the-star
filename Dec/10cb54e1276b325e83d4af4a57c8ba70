Uganda wrestled the coveted team title from perennial rivals and hosts Kenya during curtain-closing 2016 FIM Central Africa Challenge Motocross at Jamhuri Park racetrack The visitors closed the regional season in emphatic fashion, beating Kenya by 1957-1917 points to recapture the trophy they lost last season. Kenya trailed Uganda 699-2375 in the first round held at Garuga racetrack in Entebbe earlier in the year but failed to amass the much-needed points to cancel the deficit despite beating the visitors 1218-582 in the return leg on Sunday. Takkunnen siblings Jayden and Jet rode their KTM machines with zeal and vigour to hand Kenya wins in the MX50 and MX65 respectively. Alon Orland of Uganda came in second in MX50 with Tanav Choda of Kenya completing the podium dash. Dekker Kihara, who is a former MX50 champion and Nandi Kiplagat cruised to second and third positions respectively in MX65, completing an emphatic Kenyan clean sweep. But the Orland brothers Aviv and Stav made up for Alonâ€™s undoing in MX50 as they rode to a scintillating 1-2 Ugandan finish in MX85 ahead of Christian Chege of Kenya as Fortune Ssentamu of Team Uganda placed fifth. Barrack Orland, who is the father of Stav, Alon and Aviv brothers emerged the winner in the veterans and masters category, beating compatriot Mbambasi Ashiraf and home oldie Moses Mugo to the podium tussle. The Orlands are no strangers to Kenyan race circuit having already taken some impressive scalps as guest riders earlier in the season. Ugandan captain Maxime Van Pee,riding a 2017 model of KTM sfx machine, collected maximum points against a hard-charging Tutu Maina of Kenya with his brother Olivier Van Pee settling for third.
