A seven-member team has been appointed to lead the process of handing over the UoN Kenya Science campus in order to give room for the relocation of the Kenya Technical Trainer s College.According to letter dated November 24, the University of Nairobi s governing council chairman Idle Farah told Education CS Fred Matiang i his request for the names of representatives from the university to multi-sectoral task force is ready.Prof Isaac Mbeche (deputy VC Administration and Finance), Prof Horace Ochanda (deputy principal Kenya Science), George Omondi (Uasu secretary general), Angel Mbuthia (Sonu vice chair), Bernard Waweru (Academic registrar), Tim Mweseli (Chief Legal Officer) and Fredrick Omondi (Senior Legal Officer) are the university s representatives.Matiang i said the relocation of the KTTC to the KSC will give room for the expansion of the existing UN complex.Matiang i said, The December 1 date was for the process of relocation to start. Not the conclusion of the relocation. He spoke as it emerged that a memo on the relocation is now ready, and would be tabled before the Cabinet soon.The relocation has sparked off a storm, with the Ombudsman calling for the suspension of the exercise until a stakeholders task force looks into the hurried decision by the government to relocate the colleges.Ombudsman Otiende Amollo said the fate of 2,400 KTTC students has not been addressed, at a time when the college is in the middle of a Sh5 billion public-private partnership project agreement to build hostels for 4,500 students.The University of Nairobi s management board said 938 KSC students may not be accommodated in the Kikuyu campus or the college of biological and physical sciences.The Ombudsman said it is not satisfied with reasons given for the transfer because the United Nations has not made a formal request.But Matiang i has accused the office of the Ombudsman of taking sides in the matter. A raft of legislative instruments and administrative procedures are duly guiding the relocation plan, and objecting to the process at this early stage is untenable, Matiang i said in a letter to the Ombudsman.He said the government s relocation plan to allow the UN complex room for expansion in Kenya is part of its international obligation and commitments. The decision is in line with constitutional values and principles on economical and efficient application of public resources in a manner that best protects the overall interests of the Kenyan public, Matiang i said.
