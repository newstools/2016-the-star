Kabete MP Fernand Waititu was only charged with incitement after it was established that he made statements that led to the killing of two Maasais in Nairobi&rsquo;s Kayole Estate, a senior police officer told a Nairobi court. Former deputy DCIO chief John Wainaina on Thursday told magistrate Joyce Gandani he recommended Waititu be charged with hate speech and incitement to violence.He said in 2012, Waititu told the crowd to &ldquo;kick out all Maasais in the area&rdquo; when he was the Embakasi MP.&ldquo;On September 24 2012 at around midday, l was called by the DCIO in Kayole and was told there was a man by the name John Gitau who had been killed allegedly by a Maasai security guard for reportedly attempting to steal,&rdquo; Wainaina said.Wainaina said he interviewed officers at the scene who heard Waititu address a the crowd that had gathered. The MP allegedly said, &ldquo;All members of the Maasai commuinty in Kayole should be flushed out since they are Tanzanians without identity cards and our people can be security guards.&rdquo;He said after that, residents started searching for Maasais at Corner area in Kayole Estate and men - Lucas Mitibon and Nyangusi Sindoe - were assaulted.During a cross-examination by defence lawyers, Wainaina confirmed he was not at the scene when Waititu allegedly made the statement.He said there is a video clip showing Waititu making the statement. But the person who recorded the incident has gone missing for close to two years.Gandini rejected the prosecution&rsquo;s application for another adjournment so it can present two witnesses - a doctor who issued the two witnesses with P3 forms, and the missing witness who was under protection but disappeared.Waititu has since denied the charges and is out on Sh 100,000 bail.
