Senator Kipchumba Murkomen yesterday said graft allegations linking him to the NYS scandal will not affect him politicallyDemonstrations organised against him in Iten town collapsed after conveners were overpowered by rival protests in support of the senator. They can organise demonstrations but the people of Elgeyo Marakwet know the truth. Brokers being used to organise demonstrations cannot succeed, said Murkomen, adding that the brokers are funded by some Cord leaders. He said leadership in the county will not be changed at the whim of brokers who had tried to blackmail him but failed.Murkomen and DP William Ruto s aide Farouk Kibet have been accused of having benefitted from the NYS cash but Murkomen has denied the allegations.
