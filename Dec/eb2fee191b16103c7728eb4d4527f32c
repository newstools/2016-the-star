Naming a preferred presidential candidate among the Luhya aims at ensuring they vote as a bloc, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has said.&ldquo;We are not talking about who or which political party the Luhya community is going to vote for but we are talking about putting all votes in one place this time. This is my agenda and it&rsquo;s going to succeed,&rdquo; he said yesterday.Atwoli, who is in London on an official one-week tour, has been spearheading unity talks.He said results of a popularity survey among Western leaders will be released on December 31 at a rally in Muliro Gardens, Kakamega. It will guide the appointment of the community&rsquo;s spokesman and presidential candidate, Atwoli added.The survey researched the popularity of Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and other leaders.Mid-last month, Atwoli received the report from the University of Nairobi, which had been mandated to research and come up with recommendations on who is the most popular presidential candidate in Western.Mudavadi has recently indicated that he is ready to work with Cord leader Raila Odinga and he has been pushing for a joint opposition candidate under the National Super Alliance. Wetang&rsquo;ula is a Cord co-principal.Atwoli said the Luhya in the diaspora have supported calls for the community to back its own candidate.
