Ethnic cleansing is taking place in some areas of South Sudan, where the stage is set for a repeat of the Rwandan genocide, the head of the UN commission of human rights in the country said in a statement on Thursday at the end of a 10-day visit. "There is already a steady process of ethnic cleansing underway in several areas of South Sudan using starvation, gang rape and the burning of villages; everywhere we went across this country we heard villagers saying they are ready to shed blood to get their land back," Yasmin Sooka said in the statement.
