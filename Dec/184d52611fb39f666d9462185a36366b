The Jubilee Party onslaught on Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s insistence on a new generation of election ICTs does not add up. Spearheaded by Majority leader Aden Duale, it rides on President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s message on Jamhuri Day that foreign powers are at an advanced stage of interfering in the 2017 general election. Duale and JP insist that Raila and Cord are out to rig the polls. JP&rsquo;s strident accusations about Raila using foreign agents, particularly Michael Yard, of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, are ridiculous. Dr Yard is a world-renowned election administration and IT expert with over 25 years of experience in over a dozen countries. And the IFES is a non-state actor. As a general rule, governments, not oppositions, rig elections. If JP and the government have actionable evidence against Raila and Dr Yard, they should table it in court in a way that does not waste either police or judiciary time &mdash; or insults Kenyans&rsquo; intelligence and defames the foreign expert.
