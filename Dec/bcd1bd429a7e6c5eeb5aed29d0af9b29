Mandera leaders have raised concern that al Shabaab's destruction of communication masts in the county could be an indication of a major pending attack.The team led by Mandera Governor Ali Roba said the vandalism denoted economic sabotage and attempts to cut the county off while an ambush is planned.&ldquo;The terrorists are cutting Mandera from the other parts of the country. They have crippled economic activities and now the isolation plan has moved a level higher," he told a meeting of all of the county's legislators on Wednesday.Roba warned that the al-Qaeda linked terror group based in Somalia was successfully isolating the county from the rest of Kenya.&ldquo;With the communication network down, al Shabaab will be moving around the county and it will only be a couple of days before anyone notices there is a problem,&rdquo; he said.The leaders asked the government to urgently take action and stop responding "casually" to their concerns.&ldquo;No action has been taken since the masts were vandalised. I do not understand how, after the first attack, sufficient security has not been provided to protect all the masts in this county,&rdquo; said the Governor.He said Mandera's security needs to be overhauled for the sporadic attacks by al Shabaab to end.[VIDEO] Mandera's 'sufficient' security too afraid to patrol, Roba says after al Shabaab raidThe terror group has destroyed three masts in a week so far - one in Damasa, another in Dabacity, Kutulo and the third one in Chabi bar, Mandera North, on Wednesday night.Al Shabaab gunmen launched a hand grenade and destroyed an Orange telecommunication mast in Kutulo on Monday night.They were targeting two adjacent masts belonging to Safaricom and Orange telecommunication companies.Read more: Telecom mast hit by Shabaab in ManderaAlso read: Our security officers are alert &ndash; ShisiaMandera South MP Mohamed Huka told a press conference said Kotulo constituency has borne the brunt of recent terror attacks.&ldquo;If the government does not take action on al Shabaab, (they are the one who will be campaigning in Mandera, not Jubilee)," he said.
