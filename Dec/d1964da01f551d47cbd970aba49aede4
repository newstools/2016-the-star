The Capital Markets Authority has exonerated former Uchumi Supermarkets board member Mbatha Mbithi from blame in the probe into violation of governance rules and misappropriation of Sh895 million rights issue cash at the country's oldest retailer. Mbithi is presently the chief operations manager at Industrial and Commercial Development Cooperatio, a state-owned development financier. She is the only director who has been absolved by CMA so far after she presented her case on November 30.The CMA said Mbithi was acquitted after demonstrated that she had played a vigilant role in overseeing the process in the management of Uchumi and in holding management accountable in line with her responsibilities as a director. &ldquo;Mbithi satisfactorily highlighted her individual efforts to promote accountability and transparency and that she endeavoured to fulfill her fiduciary duty of care as a director of a public listed company,&rdquo; CMA said in a statement on Friday.CMA said Mbithi further demonstrated her pro-activity in pushing to have issues raised by the Uchumi's internal auditor addressed in addition to actively petitioning for the appointment of a forensic auditor to look into the affairs of the retailer.
