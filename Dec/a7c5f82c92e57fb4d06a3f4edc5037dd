The Nandi Laibons&rsquo; Council has protested against a December 8 incident at Kimondi trading centre, where it was stopped from presenting a leadership gown to President Uhuru Kenyatta.The elders now say it was part of a wider conspiracy against the Kalenjin people.Uhuru was on a two-day tour of the North and South Rift regions when the incident took place.Speaking for the first time on the aborted ceremony, the council said it had prepared an elaborate ceremony for the President and went through all security checks.&ldquo;We were shocked when we were pushed away with all the traditional leadership ornaments prepared for the occasion,&rdquo; Mzee Moses Saina said in Sironoi village on Wednesday.&ldquo;It was to be a one of a kind since 2005, when another was carried out for President Mwai Kibaki.&rdquo;The elders, among them Saina, Christopher Koiyoki, Silvester arap Tanui, Stephen Maiyo and Fredrick Songol, said they were greatly disappointed.They blamed a cartel from the Rift Valley, which they did not name, for always blocking attempts by the Kalenjin community to gain access to the President.They spoke at the home of a great, great grandchild of Nandi legendary leader Orkoiyot Koitalel arap Samoei.The council said it is the only body mandated to carry out blessing rituals for leaders of national repute.Saina said they have unmatched and undisputed powers to carry out such ceremonies, having done the same for Mzee Jomo Kenyatta on January 16, 1964, in State House, Nakuru.He said the same was done for President Daniel Moi and expressed dissatisfaction that someone decided to deny Uhuru the chance.
