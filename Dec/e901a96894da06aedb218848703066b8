Gatundu North MP Kigo Njenga has asked Auditor General Edward Ouko to resign over what he calls incompetence and lack of objectivity.He criticised disclosures in an audit that showed his constituency could not account for Sh72 million in CDF money. Njenga told off Ouko, saying he &ldquo;could easily burn this country with inaccurate and malicious reports.&rdquo;&ldquo;I am a professional accountant and I can tell you that the reports are inconclusive and aimed at perpetuating a certain narrative,&rdquo; Njenga said at a press conference at Parliament Buildings. He added, &ldquo;He should resign and give that job to a competent Kenyan who can conduct professional and objective audits and not these hoaxes.&rdquo; The MP said the auditors were shown bank statements from KCB to confirm the amount was in the account but asked why that was not captured in the final report. &ldquo;The auditor general was supplied with the necessary documents instantly, it is upon him to tell Kenyans why he did not update his report,&rdquo; he said.
