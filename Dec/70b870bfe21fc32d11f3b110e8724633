Parliament yesterday not only cut the live video feed but also restricted journalists&rsquo; movements in the Chamber and its precincts.On Tuesday, Internet access in Parliament had issues, including on smartphones.This is censorship, insensitive and unhealthy. Whether you support the amendments to the Election and other laws or not, the public should be allowed to view the House&rsquo;s proceedings. Yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings were the second part of a Special Sitting called by Speaker Justin Muturi.The live feed was cut before there was any violence anywhere within or just outside Parliament Buildings.This was anticipatory censorship, the worst kind. It reduced the whole House to a committee sitting in-camera when the issue was not a matter of national security.It was a matter of compelling national interest &mdash; the conduct of the General Election.This action was wrong and demonstrated a fundamental lack of good faith. As we said in these columns yesterday, sunshine is the best disinfectant.
