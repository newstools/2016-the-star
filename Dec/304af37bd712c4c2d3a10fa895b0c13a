The Judiciary has condemned the move by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale to threaten Justice George Odunga. Odunga on Thursday presided over a case by the opposition to stop Jubilee legislators from making amendments on the negotiated Electrol Reforms Act. Duale, during the special sitting, threatened to present a motion to discuss the judge. In a statement, Chief Justice David Maraga asked Duale to stop public lynching judges. He said Duale&rsquo;s remarks undermine the independence of the Judiciary. &ldquo;The utterances fly in the face of the rule of law and civil conduct of leaders,&rdquo; he said. Maraga said the Judiciary is an independent agency that carries out its mandate with no outside influence. &ldquo;Under my leadership as Chief Justice, the Judiciary and judges will continue to discharge their constitutional mandate independently, fairly, impartially and firmly as guided by the Constitution.&rdquo;
