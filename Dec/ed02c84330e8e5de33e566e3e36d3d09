Saboti MP David Wafula has denied claims he only criticises the county governments for alleged graft, but does not do the same when the state is accused of misappropriation. Last Friday, Governor Patrick Khaemba questioned Trans Nzoia MPs about why they were mum over the Sh5 billion scandal at the Health ministry. Wafula on Tuesday urged the county to sack corrupt officials. &ldquo;I condemn corruption at the national government but I also ask our able governor to kick out anybody in his government embezzling public funds,&rdquo; he said.
