Deputy President William Ruto yesterday urged Rift Valley residents and all Kenyans to register as voters to fully participate in the country&rsquo;s democratic process.He asked Kenyans to turn out in large numbers for voter registration in January.Ruto was addressing more than 4,000 villagers at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu county when he hosted them ahead of celebrations to mark the New Year.&ldquo;My family takes great teachings from Acts 20:35 &lsquo;... It is more blessed to give than to receive&rsquo;,&rdquo; Ruto posted on his Twitter account.Addressing the gathering, the DP said Kenyans would be able to exercise their democratic rights if they registered as voters and participate in elections.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t register as a voter, then how will you participate in choosing the right leaders to govern this country?&rdquo; asked the DP.Ruto was with his wife Rachel and his children.He said it will be imprudent for any individual to expect good leadership if they do not participate in the registration.&ldquo;You should all know that bad leaders are elected by the good citizens who do not vote,&rdquo; Ruto said.He used the opportunity to drum up support for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s government and the Jubilee Party.The DP said the government has an outstanding development track record and asked residents in the region not to be misled by opposition leaders to vote for political parties that have nothing new to offer them.&ldquo;What we have done for Kenyans speaks for itself. It is now upon you to register as voters and in large numbers and vote for Jubilee,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP has been hosting various delegations at his Sugoi home during the Christmas holiday and has been informing them of the progress made by the government.Ruto is tonight expected to host more than 20,000 people from Uasin Gishu and other North Rift counties to usher in the New Year at his home.
