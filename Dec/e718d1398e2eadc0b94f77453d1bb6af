Kenyan women MPs bounce into volleyball finalCombative Kilifi women representative Aisha Jumwa led Kenyan women Parliamentarians&rsquo; volleyball team to a deserved 2-0 victory over East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA) in a tough semifinal match at the KPA Makande gymnasium on Thursday.The tall and well built Jumwa whose spikes were unstoppable combined well with Hon Janet Nangabo whose reception was superb to see off EAlA 25-16,25-18 in this entertaining match which attracted a huge crowd.The Kenyan legislators turned the KPA gymnasium into a dance hall after the final whistle when they were joined by their male counterparts into song and dance to celebrate the win.Kenya will today play Rwanda in the final after Rwanda defeated Tanzania 2-0 in a match that had to be stopped for close to an hour due to a power black out.Rwanda who looked more technical won the first set 25-23 after Tanzania had given them a scare with a strong comeback which saw them temporarily lead 19-18.The Rwandese came into the second set much more organised to win the second set 25-23 to storm the final at the expense of the youthful Tanzanians.Earlier,Kenyan men and Rwanda had also qualified for today&rsquo;s finals after beating EALA and Uganda with identical 2-0 scores at the same venue.In football, Uganda will meet Burundi in the final this afternoon after both saw off their opponents at the semi-final stage.A lone goal by Jean Marie Campaye in the 58th minute was all Burundi needed to eliminate Tanzania 1-0 in the first semi final while Uganda rocked EALA 3-0 in the second semi.Martin Ngonga&rsquo;s third minute strike and Julius Maganda Nsereko&rsquo;s brace in the eigth and 42nd minute was enough to lock out the Arusha based law makers.The games which attracted all the six East Africa Parliamentarians end today.
