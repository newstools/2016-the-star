Three people sustained serious injuries when supporters of Migori Governor Okoth Obado and aspirant Ochillo Ayacko clashed on Saturday.Ayacko was holding a series of meetings in Suna Central ward to drum up support for his bid when the clash happened in the Ngege area.Earlier, Ayacko had meetings in the Lichota and Nyamware areas. &ldquo;An Obado supporter threw a stone at the group of Ayacko&rsquo;s supporters badly injuring a man identified as Eliud Ogutu,&rdquo; a witness said. A fight then broke out between Obado and Ayacko&rsquo;s supporters as other residents scampered for safety in nearby plantations. Fred Obuoga and Jared Kijana, who support Obado, sustained serious panga injuries in their heads and shoulders. They were taken to Migori County Referral Hospital. &ldquo;I was on a motorbike and when I said I support the governor, a group of rowdy youths chased after me and attacked me,&rdquo; Kijana said. Speaking later in Posta Grounds in Migori town, Suna Central Ward aspirant Samuel O&rsquo;Brien blamed Obado&rsquo;s supporters for the fracas.&ldquo;We were attacked as we did peaceful campaigns. Those who caused the chaos are known. All we seek is equitable distribution of wealth among all residents, not just relatives of the governor,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien said. Ayacko urged residents to be careful about whom they elect as governor. &ldquo;It is your responsibility to ensure you elect a governor who will ensure the equitable distribution of resources through devolution,&rdquo; he said.Ayacko urged leaders not to incite the youth to cause chaos, but instead involve them in development. &ldquo;Right now Obado is in office while aspirants campaign. It is only voters who will decide who the best is among us,&rdquo; he said.
