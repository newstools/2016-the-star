Kenya women&rsquo;s Premier League Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo; is set to resume this weekend at various venues across the country after a two months break.The event has gone on recess to pave way for the national team preparations in the just ended Africa Women Cup of nations in Cameroon. The national team was bundled out of the competition at the group stages after scoring only two goals in the entire tournament while Nigeria retained the title with a 1-0 win over Cameroon in the final.Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo; teams, especially Spedag, Thika Queens and Soccer Queens contributed the bulk of players to the national team thus forcing their fixtures to be shelved.Football Kenya Federation vice chairperson Doris Petra said the league will resume this Sunday and some of the fixtures will be staged mid-week to ensure the league is concluded this year. &ldquo;Winners of Zone &lsquo;B&rsquo; are already known and therefore the focus will be on Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo;. The move is to ensure the league doesn&rsquo;t spill to the next calender,&rdquo; said the official.She added: &ldquo;The league should have ended by now if Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo; matches had been played. However, as you are aware, most players in the group were part of the national team and it would have been unfair for these teams to play their matches without some of their key players.&rdquo;Zone A joint leaders, reigning champions Thika Queens and Spedag women&rsquo;s team with 23 points each, will take on their respective opponents as they seek to emerge top of the pool with three round of matches remaining. Spedag will come up against Soccer Sisters at Camp Toyoyo, while Thika Queens will welcome Soccer Queens at the Thika Stadium on Sunday. At the end the remaining league fixtures, the overall winner of Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo; will battle Pool &lsquo;B&rsquo; winners Oserian, who have already qualified for the play-off.
