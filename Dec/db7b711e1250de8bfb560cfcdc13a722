Four MPs and 20 senior government officials are among 100 adult candidates who sat the KCSE exam in the North Rift this year.The MPs from Bungoma, Nandi and Uasin Gishu counties sat the exam at two private centres in Bungoma and Baringo.They are the Acacia Adult Education School in Eldama Ravine and Central Primary School in Eldoret town.Acacia school director Benjamin Cheboi refused to reveal the MPs identities. They have completed the exam well and their names will be known at the time the results are out, Cheboi said yesterday.Six MCAs also sat the exam at the school.Cheboi said the government officials wanted to improve their grades. Some of the senior government officers had already sat the exam but they failed and this year they did the KCSE exam as a way of upgrading themselves, he said.The MPs and government officials walked to the exam centres daily instead of using their official cars and left their bodyguards behind to avoid being identified.Cheboi said the MPs and other officials requested for privacy as they sat the exam.They wanted the media kept away so they could concentrate.Cheboi said he trained the MPs and senior government officials during private sessions before they sat the exam. Many of them came for class work regularly and we helped them where possible. We hope they will have performed well when the results are released, he said.Kenya National Parents Association chairman Nicholas Maiyo said the group is happy the exam was completed without hitches. We are proud of the measures implemented by the government to curb cheating and other malpractices, he said.Maiyo said the credibility of the national exams has been restored through the new measures implemented by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi and his team.
