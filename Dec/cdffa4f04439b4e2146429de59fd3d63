Let us not roll back critical gains made in the first phase of devolved governments. Just like in the other aspects of life and governance, we believe technology can be duly applied to the next election."Religious leaders said on Friday that Uhuru should rise above partisan interests and reject the adoption of changes to electoral laws.The National Council of Churches of Kenya and Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims said this will prevent another round of political violence come 2017.The leaders condemned the hurried manner in which amendments to election laws were crafted and passed by one side of the political divide.The move by Jubilee raised political mistrust, they said, and added that the signing of the changes into law would be a recipe for violence.More on this: Religious leaders warn Uhuru against signing disputed election laws, propose talks
