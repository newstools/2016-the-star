Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have asked telecoms companies to block social media networks from Sunday night, apparently to thwart anticipated protests against plans by President Joseph Kabila to stay in power beyond the end of his mandate. The request was made in a letter by the Regulatory Authority of the Post and Telecommunications of Congo (ARPTC), a copy of which was seen by Reuters. It listed Facebook, Twitter , Skype, YouTube and LinkedIn as services that should be temporarily blocked. Spokesmen for the government and the telecommunications minister could not immediately be reached for comment. Among major telecoms providers, Vodacom confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment on whether it would comply. Orange had no immediate comment. Airtel could not be reached. More than 50 people died in demonstrations in September over delays to a presidential election to choose a successor to Kabila, who under the constitution should step down next Monday. The government says the vote cannot be organised before April 2018 due to problems enrolling millions of voters. The government ordered social media networks and the Internet to be cut during deadly anti-government protests in January 2015, justifying the measure as necessary to prevent rumours that could fuel violence.
