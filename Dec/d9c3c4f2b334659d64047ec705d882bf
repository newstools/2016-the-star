When last heard of, the Moi-era former Head of the Civil Servicer Philip Mbithi had taken up the life of a prophet on the Old Testament model.But even then, taking up a calling that requires the renunciation of all worldly riches, Professor Mbithi was passing his golden years on a large ranch out in Konza, in what is now Machakos County.I cannot remember at this point what the total acreage is of this ranch was, but those who have visited it have invariably referred to it as &ldquo;expansive&rdquo;, meaning that it must run into thousands of acres. And Mbithi, by the standards of the Moi era top brass, had famously clean hands.That a man like the deeply religious Prof Mbithi, who was in no way the classic greedy presidential appointee, ended up with such a vast tract of land, illuminates the fact that it was standard operating procedure under the Moi regime's long years in power (1978 to 2001) for loyalty to that regime to be rewarded with a suitably huge spread of government land.This was made possible by the fact that the British colonial government that ruled what is now Kenya, from the late 1800s to 1963, when Kenya got its Independence, worked to create an economy based on large commercial farms. These farms were not intended for the indigenous communities, of course, but for the White &ldquo;settlers&rdquo;, many of whom left Kenya in the 1960s, receiving compensation for their land, and heading for Australia, the UK and South Africa.In short, the Kenyan government for many decades was the custodian of hundreds of duly registered - and very large - parcels of land. And while some were reserved for the settlement of smallholder farmers, through subdivisions that created small plots of about five acres each, other parcels were left intact for various reasons.The practice did not start with Moi, however. It was the Jomo Kenyatta government that first set the trend of Cabinet ministers, permanent secretaries and senior military officers also being some of the largest landowners in the nation never mind they were all born into peasant families that owned just the usual small subsistence-level farms as everybody else. Who was to know back then, that a day would come when any leader who owned a nice spread thus obtained could easily be accused of having &ldquo;betrayed the landless&rdquo; in his region?
