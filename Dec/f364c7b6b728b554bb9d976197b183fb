Chief Justice David Maraga should be commended for his call yesterday urging the anti-graft agencies to reexamine their standard operating procedures and make the war on corruption an effective crusade (see P14).He urged that the internecine multiagency blame game between these agencies and the Judiciary should come to an end and they must identify the lapses and fix them at once.He directed his remarks to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and Directorate of Public Prosecutions.The hearings in corruption cases should be continuous and entertain no predatory delays. Too many professionals are becoming complicit in corruption cases, including doctors and lawyers who subscribe to procrastination. Kenya&rsquo;s never-ending corruption cases see far fewer convictions and deterrent fines than in most other countries.One day impunity and a broken down justice system will come to be associated with professional failings in evidence-based investigations, prosecutions and judgments. And corruption will finally have a face &ndash; on the other side of the dock.
