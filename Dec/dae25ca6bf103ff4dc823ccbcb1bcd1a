Former Olympic 800m silver medallist Nigel Amos has moved his training in Kenya as he seeks to study the ropes from his tormentor, Olympic and world champion, David Rudisha.Heading to the 2012 London Olympics and 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Amos had looked like the sure bet to dethrone the current world record holder over the distance but has remained just another pipe dream. To master the ways of his conqueror, the Botswanian has relocated his training base to Kaptagat with a view of excelling at the next year s London IAAF World Championships.The Commonwealth 800m champion is training at the Rosa Training Camp in Kaptagat and believes the high altitude and specifically the rugged-terrain willbe good for his training as he head to the next season.Amos beat Rudisha in Glasgow s Commonwealth Games and the Lausanne Diamond League but all was not well at last year s World Championships and the Rio Olympic Games where he missed out on the final. I had a superb season and I was determined to perform well in Rio Olympics in a bid to improve on my silver medal in London 2012 but I was even shockedwhen I didn t make to the final. I think I was fatigued because of the Africa championships, he said. He observed that his training in Kenya has been rigorous and he has been doing extra kilometres everyday. Per day, I do at least 15km from the 6km I used to cover back at home. It is really good training here especially when you go through the forest. I just like the serene environment. I have already acclimatised to the high altitude weather, he said. He termed his move to train in Kenya as the best, owing to the weather and encouragement from the hardworking athletes. Having trained in Kenya for a month now, Amos will travel back home for Christmas celebration before resuming training in January.
