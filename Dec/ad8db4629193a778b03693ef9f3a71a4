Pharmaceuticals and equipment estimated at over Sh1 billion were on Wednesday evening reduced to ashes in a fire at ministry of health depot in Garissa.The fire started at 3pm and it took fire fighters from the Garissa county and the military over six hours to put it off.The county health executive Hubie Hussein said the fire could have been caused by an electrical fault and spread so fast due to the chemicals inside."Even with the backup from the military who came with water tankers to assist the county fire trucks that had run out of water, their efforts were futile. It took over six hours to contain it," she said. Hubie said the regional depot located at the public health offices in Garissa town was recently stocked with supplies from Medical Supplies Agency.Some of the equipment that went up in flames included children weighing machines, beds, drugs among other medical donations from UNICEF and WHO. Also destroyed were stock piles of assorted vaccines for Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties.Others included office stores among them computers, furniture, refrigerators, registers, reporting tools among others. Hubie described the destruction as a 'massive' lose to the region. "This incident is a big blow to the efforts by the county to ensure that all public facilities are stocked," she said. She said it was even more saddening that the county and sub-county supplies had not been distributed.
