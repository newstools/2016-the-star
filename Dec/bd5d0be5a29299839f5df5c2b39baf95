Nairobi residents have been told to pray for rains following the announcement of water rationing by a city firm starting this Sunday.Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company managing director Philip Gichuki yesterday asked city residents to pray for the rains, saying if it doesn&rsquo;t rain in two days there will be water rationing. He said the rationing may go on until March 2017.Speaking to the Star in his office, Gichuki said the Ndakaini Dam, which supplies water to Nairobi is only 48 per cent full after a reduction of water in Chania River.&ldquo;We are waiting for it to fill up, if it rains. Only then, we will have enough water supply to city residents,&rdquo; the MD said.He said those who used to get water five days a week will receive the commodity for four days once the rationing is implemented.Those who used to get running water for four days a week, will receive three days.&ldquo;There is no cause for alarm, but we will ensure that the available water is only for domestic use,&rdquo; Gichuki said.He asked residents to use water sparingly, saying the company will close down all car-wash businesses to ensure water is only used for domestic purposes.Gichuki also advised residents not to water their lawns daily.He urged water vendors not to take advantage of the shortage because the water company enforcement officers will arrest those illegally vending water.Gichuki said, however, the reduction in water supply is only 13 per cent.He said the Ruiru Dam, which supplies four per cent of Nairobi water and Sasumua Dam, which supplies 11 per cent are operating normally.&ldquo;The meteorological department has also issued an advisory on the looming drought and we all need to take precautions,&rdquo; Gichuki said.
