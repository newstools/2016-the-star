The High Court has temporary stopped Kenya Airports Authority from recruiting a new general manager for projects and engineering services.Justice Monica Mbaru said KAA should await the hearing and determination of a suit by activist Okiya Omtatah.Mbaru, of the Employment and Labour Relations Court, certified Omtatah's suit as urgent in a ruling on Thursday.He ordered that the authority, Public Service Commission, State Corporation Advisory Committee, Engineers Board of Kenya and the Attorney General be served with the suit papers ahead of a January 9 hearing.Omtatah says in the suit that the three candidates shortlisted for the job are unqualified. The three are Eric Nyangesi, Cecilia Magner and Cosmas Lang&rsquo;at.&ldquo;The shortlisted candidates are unqualified as they lack both training and experience in airport infrastructure&rdquo; he says.The activist also says the three, whom he named as interested parties in the suit, were selected in a process that did not adhere to constitutional procedures.He further says the exercise lacked &ldquo;constitutional values which include competitiveness, merits and openness in public appointments&rdquo;.Among the orders the activist is seeking is the annulment of Nyangesi's ongoing recruitment and a requirement for KAA to make the appointment in accordance with the law and international best practice.
