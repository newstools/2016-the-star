The government has declared December 27 a holiday following Boxing Day or the Day of Goodwill.Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery announced this in a gazette notice on Friday.Section 4 of Public Holidays Act 2011 states that when a public holiday falls on a Sunday, the following day becomes a holiday.This means that two holidays overlap on Monday, allowing Tuesday to also be a holiday.The constitution defines three national holidays under Section 9. These are Madaraka Day, marked on June 1, Mashujaa Day on October 20, and Jamhuri Day on December 12.Cap 229 of the Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act (now repealed but whose subsidiary legislation is still in force until replaced) lists these national days, and adds to them seven other days to be observed as public holidays.These are New Year&rsquo;s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labour Day, Idd-Ul-Fitr Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Many of these are internationally recognised.
