Transport regulator NTSA on Tuesday devised a new way of punishing traffic offenders at Sachangwan black-spot on Nakuru-Eldoret highway.The authority used a billboard with inscriptions "Kindly observe lane discipline, don't be like me". Drivers who violate the traffic law were forced wear a reflective jacket, carry the signage strategically for other drivers until another offender is arrested.The pictures, which were shared widely in social media, showed male and female drivers carrying the billboard.Through its official twitter account, the National Transport and Safety Authority said: "All drivers must observe discipline on the roads".The new form of punishment drew mixed reactions from Kenyans where most Twitter users applauded the agency for the good work.A traffic offender holds the signage introduced by NTSA at Sachang'wan black spot on Tuesday, December 27. /COURTESY"Sachangwan normally trends for horrific reasons but today is safety measures kudos NTSA.
