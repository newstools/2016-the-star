Parliament breaks its recess tomorrow to deal with two matters: To approve the budget policy statement 2017-18 and to amend the Elections Laws Amendment Bill 2015.The Opposition has raised concerns and warned it will not accept any changes to the Elections Laws.With slightly more than eight months to Election Day, such intransigence could be a sign of protracted tensions to come.Politicians have wasted the better part of more than four years when it comes to preparing for the 12th General Election.At the same time, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has officially complained that the new timelines are too tight, but said they are doing what they can. This too could be a source of future friction and more delay.MPs need to handle these matters objectively and in a timely and bipartisan spirit and set the stage for a credible, free and fair election.Now more than ever, MPs need to put Kenya first.
