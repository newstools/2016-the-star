A Mombasa court has issued summonses to eight witnesses who are to testify in the extradition proceedings of the sons of the slain Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners.Chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea said on Friday that the case would not proceed without the witnesses mentioned in affidavits produced by the office of the DPP from the United States of America.The decision is a blow to the State since the Director of Public Prosecution said they will not produce live witnesses in court.On December 1, assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told the court that they will not be calling any witnesses in the proceedings and that they would instead use affidavits sworn by officers from the US.But defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta opposed this and made an application compelling the State to produce the witnesses.Among those who will be cross-examined are the American chief investigator Michael Lockard and a prosecutor in the New York court Mathew Kellow.The remaining six are confidential sources whose names are not mentioned.Baktash Akasha, Gulam Hussein, Ibrahim Akasha and Vijaygiri Anandgiri Goswami are wanted in the US for drug trafficking.Warrants of arrest against the four were issued by a US court in November 2014. They are required to answer a narcotics importation conspiracy charge.More on this: Fugitives?
