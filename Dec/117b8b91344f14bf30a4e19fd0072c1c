Kipsigis leaders in Narok county have told Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto to stop meddling in the county&rsquo;s politics.Narok South Professionals chairman Nahashon Langat said the leaders urged the Bomet governor to concentrate on issues affecting his own county instead of engaging in other counties&rsquo; problems.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, he said they will not allow outsider politicians to divide Narok residents along tribal lines.&ldquo;It is totally unacceptable for Rutto to interfere with the county&rsquo;s affairs and try to force our people to join his new party, which only deals with village matters. He should stop being a political tourist moving around the Kipsigis regions in Narok,&rdquo; Langat said.Langat is the top contender for Narok South MP and he wants to run on the Jubilee Party ticket.Don&rsquo;t divide residentsHe said people are tired of politics that undermine development and cause divisions in the cosmopolitan county.&ldquo;He has gone beyond the boundaries and if he continues, we are saying enough is enough. The Kipsigis in Narok county are solidly behind Deputy President William Ruto and anybody advising the community otherwise is an enemy,&rdquo; Langat said.The Kipsigis are in the Jubilee government to stay because the community stands to benefit a lot from this administration, he said.Narok JP zone, not ODMThe aspirant said Narok county is a Jubilee zone and dismissed Cord leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s assertions that the region is an opposition zone.&ldquo;ODM is not popular in the county and as the leaders we will campaign in every corner of the county to ensure Jubilee Party sweeps all the seats from the governor to the MCA level,&rdquo; Langat added.Meanwhile, a leader from Emurua Dikirr constituency has told area MP Johana Ngeno, a close ally of the Bomet governor, to tone down his attacks on DP Ruto as &ldquo;his efforts were fruitless.&rdquo;David Keter said the MP is fond of demeaning the Deputy President whenever he attends meetings in the Rift Valley.&ldquo;He should stop his cheap politics and instead respect DP Ruto because he has a national outlook and was elected by all Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Keter wants to unseat Ngeno on the JP ticket. He urged the legislator to stop being used by &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; who aim to divide the Kalenjin community.Keter said JP is receiving overwhelming support in the Rift Valley and cautioned those opposing it, saying they risk political oblivion.
