Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho plans a major political rally in Likoni on Sunday, a week after Deputy President William Ruto s tour of the county.The DP criticised Joho for opposing government projects. Joho says Jubilee is impoverishing the Coast by concentrating development in Central and the Rift Valley. The governor will tell Likoni residents why they cannot trust the Jubilee government. Joho wants to ensure the ground will be very hot for Uhuru when he comes back this month, a senior official in Joho s administration told the Star yesterday.On Thursday, the governor directed his foot soldiers to start preparing for the rally. Coast governors, MPs and other leaders are expected to attend.Joho says Coast and Nyanza, perceived to be opposition strongholds, have been left out of government projects or have received very minimal favours compared to Central and the Rift Valley.During his Central region tour on Tuesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta waived a Sh2.4 billion debt for coffee farmers.This has angered Joho, who questioned why Uhuru in January announced that squatters on the 930-acre Waitiki Farm would pay Sh1.2 billion for their land, even after promising to resettle them.
