Ugunja politician Otieno Alur has termed as &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; the drive by some ODM leaders to register voters via phone in Siaya county ahead of the party nominations. He said some party officials have started registering and capturing data of unsuspecting voters via phone text messages in specific zones. He called it a scheme to rig the polls. Alur on Sunday said the voters are told to fill in their details through a text message to enable them participate in the primaries.He urged ODM officials to intervene. Alur, seeking the Ugunja MP seat, said such outdated tactics would cause voter apathy. He said they would deny party leader Raila Odinga a consolidated vote, since disgruntled voters will shun the &ldquo;suspicious drive&rdquo;.
