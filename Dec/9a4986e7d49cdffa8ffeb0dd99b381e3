Cord leader Raila Odinga has said the opposition did not attend the Kenya Private Sector Association peace strategy meeting because it was not consulted.He said there were no proper arrangements done with the opposition.Raila said Cord did not boycott the meeting. He spoke during the third memorial service of the late Barrack Okul in Karachuonyo constituency on Saturday. Present were ODM national chairman John Mbadi, Nominated MP Oburu Oginga, Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga.Raila said the current IEBC secretariat is partly to blame for delays. Let Kenyans know that we know we need a free and fair electoral process. But we should have been consulted on a meeting of such magnitude aimed at building peace, he said.Raila accused the Jubilee government of hijacking the electoral preparation process. The opposition chief said Jubilee has a hidden agenda and leaders appearance at the meeting was only to rubber-stamp their political scheme. We did not want to attend a meeting whose agenda had been sanitised by Jubilee even though we all wanted to be guaranteed a smooth electoral process, he said.Raila said the opposition was not aware of resolutions to be signed at the end of the meeting. The Cord leader questioned the reasoning behind the readvertisement of the IEBC chairperson position, saying it was a tactic being used by the Jubilee administration to delay the next polls. He expressed concern the Issack Hassan-team has continued to stay in office despite Kenyans losing trust in it . Why should Issack Hassan and his fellow commissioners continue to be stubborn? We know the election date is cast in stone. The IEBC will push this election merely because it is sleeping with the Jubilee government in the same bed.
