The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has cut food rations for refugees in Kenya amid a severe funding shortage.In a statement on Tuesday, WFP said the change was as a result of lack of resources to feed the 434,000 refugees living in Kenya&rsquo;s Dadaab and Kakuma camps.They also said the available rations may not be sufficient to support refugees camping at the Kalobeyei settlement in Turkana county."We are appealing to donors to quickly come to the aid of the refugees who rely on WFP food assistance for survival," Annalisa Conte, Kenya's WFP representative and country director, said."WFP immediately requires $13.7 million (Sh1.39 billion) to cover the food and cash needs for the refugees between December and April," the agency said.WFP provides food assistance to refugees in Kenya as a combination of cash transfers and food distributions."Starting this month, to stretch food supplies further, WFP was forced to cut the food ration size to half of the refugees&rsquo; monthly entitlement," Conte said.Conte said the food currently available will only last until the end of February unless the agency receives new funding."Cash transfers have not yet been reduced, but the funding for cash-based assistance will be exhausted by the end of January if new resources are not available," she said."A generous and critically important $22 million (Sh2.2 billion) shipment of food from the United States is en route to Dadaab and Kakuma, and should be available for distribution by May, but we have a dangerous gap in funding until then," Conte warned.Refugees in Dadaab and Kakuma camps receive food items including flour and vegetable oil, and cash for buying fresh food. Children, pregnant women and nursing mothers are also given specialised fortified foods to prevent malnutrition, while schoolgoers are given porridge for concentration.The alarm has been sounded at a time the government has stated that the camps need to be closed, citing security and maintenance burden.Read: State extends Dadaab refugee camp closure by six monthsAlso read: UNHCR welcomes Dadaab closure extension, calls for more flexible timeframeHealth workers worried about children suffering acute malnutritionHealth workers in hospitals in the five refugee camps in Dadaab are concerned about the number of malnourished children.Abdulamlik Wanyama, the director of a MSF hospital in Dagahley camp, said the number has been increasing.&ldquo;We recognise the fact that healthcare in Dadaab is not perfect but we have put in place quite a number of mitigating efforts to contain the situation,&rdquo; said Wanyama.&ldquo;It is also worth noting that over the last 12 months, the global acute malnutrition rate has risen from eight per cent to 12 per cent. This trend is not any different in the camp."Dr Adulmalik Wanyama examines a malnourished at MSF hospital, Dagahley, in the Dadaab refugee camp. /JACK OWUORA spot check at the children&rsquo;s ward at MSF Dagahley found that a number of children were being given medicine intravenously.This is the infusion of liquid substances directly into a vein, for blood transfusion or as fluid replacement to correct dehydration, for example.This intravenous therapy may be used to correct electrolyte imbalances, deliver medications, for blood transfusion or as fluid replacement to correct, for example, dehydration.&ldquo;Children who are under the age of five and are suffering from acute malnutrition usually have very low weight and height. They may also have difficulty keeping themselves properly hydrated,&rdquo; Wanyama said.The World Health Organization said severe acute malnutrition affects about 19 million children under the age of five globally, and is also estimated to account for approximately 400,000 child deaths each year.Other diseases affecting children in the camps include malnutrition, pneumonia and diarrhoea.Wanyama added that those who are not receiving treatment in hospitals were being tracked by health workers, on a weekly basis,to avoid preventable deaths.&ldquo;In order to avoid losing patients, health workers conduct home visits at least once a week. During these visits, children, expectant women and women who recently gave birth are targeted most,&rdquo; Wanyama said.The facility also has a list of children who are at risk of developing severe acute malnutrition. These are children born with deformities, heart diseases and other conditions.
