The two are presumed to be the key presidential candidates on Election Day.The chairperson of the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Samuel Chepkonga, will introduce new clauses to the Elections Act allowing the IEBC to come up with other ways besides technology to identify voters. &ldquo;Without prejudice to the preceding provisions of this section, the Commission shall put in place an alternative and complementary mechanism for identification and transmission of election results that is simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent," section 44 (8A) states.Chepkonga will also move several amendments to the Bill, adjusting major timelines.
