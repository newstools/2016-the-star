Presidential hopeful Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are is drafting a motion to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta for deaths occasioned by the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike.The Nyamira senator said the President should be sent home for gross violation of the Constitution, one of the three grounds for the removal of the President from office as provided in the supreme law. Article 145 provides that the President can be impeached on grounds of gross violation of the Constitution or any other law, where there are serious reasons to believe the President has committed a crime under national or international law and for gross misconduct.For an impeachment motion to be moved, it must be supported by a third of all members of the National Assembly.Mong&rsquo;are said by failing to end the doctors&rsquo; strike to save lives and withholding a report on the actual number of soldiers killed during the El Adde attack, Uhuru has violated the Constitution. He cites the nondisclosure of the number of those killed in the Westgate Mall and the Garissa University College terror attacks by al Shabaab as some of the evidence supporting the impeachment motion.According to Mong&rsquo;are, the Wednesday cordoning off Parliament by anti-riot police during a Senate debate on the controversial election laws will also see the President censured. The legislator said Uhuru has failed to protect lives he swore to safeguard.
