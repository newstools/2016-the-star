Deputy President William Ruto yesterday inspected the installation of electricity in Tana River county under the Last Mile Connectivity project.He said the project is part of Jubilee&rsquo;s efforts to ensure all Kenyans get electricity.&ldquo;We are empowering the people by providing them with choices. One way of doing this is lighting up homes and businesses,&rdquo; Ruto said.&ldquo;With electricity connected to her house, Mama Halima Gariso of Mororo, Tana River County can now use power to improve her life.&rdquo; The first phase of Last Mile Connectivity Project, which started in April, targeted 314,000 households within a radius of 600m of a transformer. Connections under the phase, largely funded by the African Development Bank for Sh13.5 billion, cost Sh15,000, which can be deducted from monthly bills over a maximum of 36 months.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, who accompanied the DP, said the government has connected electricity to households, markets, schools and hospitals.
