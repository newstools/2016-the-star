Millie was fighting for the rights of Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Regarding the election laws, the opposition leader told a rally at Homa Bay High school on Wednesday that changes will not be permitted.He said the recent by-elections have shown that the electronic voter identification system can operate without hitches.&ldquo;The by-elections were conducted (by digital systems) in areas considered remote. We can use satellite to avert the electoral malpractices Jubilee is trying to avoid," he said.Raila said there will be no general election next August if Parliament amends the laws to pave way for manual voter identification. &ldquo;We understand what the manual process entails and cannot allow ourselves to go back to it. That&rsquo;s why people like Millie are out to save this save country,&rdquo; he said.Members of the Minji Minji na UhuRuto women's group during a demonstration in Kiambu county against Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo, whom they said should apologise for insulting President Uhuru Kenyatta, December 21, 2016. /STANLEY NJENGARead more: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election lawsMPs John Mbadi (Suba) and Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman representative) pledged to block any amendment tot he laws.&ldquo;We will not sit back and watch while the Jubilee administration brings contravening bills to Parliament.
