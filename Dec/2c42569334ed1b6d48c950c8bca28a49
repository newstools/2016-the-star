Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi yesterday accused cartels and dishonest ministry officials of frustrating the government&rsquo;s efforts to digitize land records (see page 12).Digitisation could eliminate the scourge of missing land records and reduce fraudulent transactions. Not long ago, Prof Kaimenyi revoked all land control boards, saying they had become havens of corruption and grabbing. Later he instated them, pending digitisation, enhancement of efficiency, records keeping, ease of transactions and increased revenue generation. In the age of Education CS Fred Matiangi&rsquo;s massive hands-on reform of national examinations this year, Prof Kaimenyi should be making corrective action reports to Kenyans instead of bewailing shadowy cartels and unidentified bureaucrats. Well-publicised decision and action points are what long-suffering Kenyans want to hear from all ministries, not lonely cries as if in a wilderness. The Education ministry partnered with the Interior ministry and gave Kenya its cleanest national exams in decades. Borrow a leaf from Dr Matiang&rsquo;i, Prof Kaimenyi.
