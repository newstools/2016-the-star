There was pain and agony at the Murang&rsquo;a County Hospital as patients went unattended following the doctors&rsquo; strike.Two mothers delivered outside the hospital on Monday after writhing in pain for hours with no one to assist them.The two women, who had been accompanied by their relatives, gave birth as they tried to talk to the hospital&rsquo;s staff to be admitted.Mary Njeri, one of the mothers, said when she was chased away. She gave birth as she tried to walk to Murang&rsquo;a town to look for another hospital, as passersby watched in shock.She said when she came to the hospital, she was unaware of the health workers' strike.The expectant mother was helped by the Kenya Medical Training College students.Mother Ann Wanjiru said she would camp at the hospital until the doctors resume work.She said she had sought medical services at a local private health centre, but she could not afford the Sh11,000 fees they charged her to deliver.Wanjiru, who was accompanied by her daughter, said she was praying that the doctors' call off the strike.&ldquo;I am pleading with the government to give them whatever they want and end the stalemate so that we can get services soon,&rdquo; she said.She said the only option she has is to go back home as she did not have money to go to a private hospital.Resident Paul Ngugi said he was worried about premature infants in the hospital.Ngugi, who had gone to the hospital to check on his niece, said there is a high chance these infants would die for lack of close monitoring.He asked the hospital&rsquo;s administration to allow them to take the children away to seek services in other hospitals before it's too late.&ldquo;All those children in incubators will definitely die if they do not get attention from the medics,&rdquo; Ngugi said.As patients camped at the hospital&rsquo;s gate stranded, the medics pitched tent in Mumbi Grounds.
