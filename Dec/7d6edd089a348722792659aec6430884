Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i, Knec and the TSC said they administered a KCPE exam free of cheating and leakages.Matiang i said the exams ran smoothly, which he all credited to the measures introduced by the Education ministry and other critical agencies working together.He said in line with the President s directive, he is a happy man that he promised never to give excuses over perennial exam leakages.Matiang i said there were 21 attempted cases of exam malpractices, which failed.The attempts were especially in Mandera county, where teachers sat in the bush with cell phones trying to send answers to candidates, but answers were intercepted by security agencies.He said, The cases were detected and dealt with appropriately before they could happen. While the results for 2,709 candidates were cancelled in 2015, the CS said there was no cancellation of results for any candidate in 2016 .He lauded the partnership of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, his ICT counterpart Joe Mucheru and security agencies.Matiang i said headteachers and principals are the heroes and heroines who helped achieve credible exams and they should be empowered to manage future exams.The headteachers were part of the new measures that required them to directly take charge of exam centres as managers.Matiang i said the strategy focused on the heads because they were key in delivering credible exams.He said this year s results are rightfully for very candidate because they did not undergo any moderation after marking.No ranking There wass no ranking of candidates and schools for lack of adequate time to come up with the ranking criteria.This is even after the ranking law was passed by Parliament in August and assented to by the President in October. Ranking was abolished in 2014.Matiang i said the law requires that we conduct research, consult widely and come up with regulations that provide the basis for ranking . Unfortunately, due to the short period between the time the law was enacted and when the KCPE examination was administered, the ministry was unable to prepare for its implementation, he said.
