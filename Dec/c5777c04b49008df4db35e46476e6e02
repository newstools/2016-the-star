Western and Nyanza senators are flexing their muscles as they plot how to unseat governors, whom they accuse of poor performance.The legislators say they want to correct the mess created by governors, adding that their objective is to bring about the change desired by residents.They have criticised governors for running down the counties by presiding over massive corruption, which, they say, has undermined services.Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), Anyang Nyong&rsquo;o (Kisumu), Chris Obure (Kisii), Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are (Nyamira) and James Orengo (Siaya) are in the running for governor.With the Auditor General&rsquo;s report disclosing billions of shillings are unaccounted for, the governor hopefuls have taken advantage of the findings and use them to dress down the incumbents.The report showed the governors have presided over losses of billions of shillings through unsupported expenditures, ghost projects, irregular payments and faulty procurement.But governors have defended themselves against the report, saying no money has been lost. Political analyst Jared Okello says senators are driven by the desire to control billions of shillings.Okello said many senators have realised governors hold powerful positions. He said considering how the Senate has been disregarded as the House of retirees, many members want to shift to the counties.But Okello warns unseating governors will not be easy, as they are now more monied than the Senators. &ldquo;Money plays a significant role in elections. At least they also have projects to show voters, unlike senators,&rdquo; he added.Nyong&rsquo;o wants to dislodge Governor Jack Ranguma and Khalwale is out to square it off with Wycliffe Oparanya. Orengo will face Cornel Rasanga, Mong&rsquo;are against John Nyagarama, while Obure, who has yet to declare officially, plans to unseat Governor James Ongwae.
