President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Christmas gift for Likoni and Mtongwe residents will be the reintroduction of ferry services at the Mtongwe channel crossing.Transport PS Irungu Nyakera on Wednesday confirmed Uhuru will re-open the channel during his Coast tour this month.&ldquo;Our commitment is within the next two weeks, hopefully when the President is here; we can have the services at the Mtongwe channel restarted,&rdquo; he said.Nyakera said the Kenya Ferry Services management has confirmed that the Mtongwe channel, which was closed in November 2011, will be ready for use in the next two weeks.&ldquo;This certainly will be our Christmas gift for the Mtongwe residents as operations start again,&rdquo; he said.The PS was speaking during the re-launch of the MV Harambee, which was withdrawn last December following perennial breakdowns.The 26-year-old ferry was taken for upgrading in September and its two engines have since been replaced. Body works and other repairs have also been done.KFS said it has spent Sh143 million on the repairs and engines.Managing director Bakari Gowa said one of the two new ferries, MV Likoni or MV Kwale, will be taken to Mtongwe.The service was withdrawn in November 2011 after the national government decommissioned two old ferries for being unseaworthy, KFS said.Poor infrastructure was also cited as a reason for closure and KFS has been upgrading the channel for smooth operations.In 1994, one the Kenya&rsquo;s worst maritime accidents happened at Mtongwe, when more than 270 people were killed after a ferry capsized.The withdrawal of the vessels at Mtongwe has put pressure on the Likoni Channel, which has been experiencing congestion from time to time.Mtongwe and Likoni residents have complained of congestion at Likoni, which serves an estimated 300,000 people and 6,000 vehicles a day.
