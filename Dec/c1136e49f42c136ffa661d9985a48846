The first person to ever hit the 16 correct predictions mark is Peter Byegon, a Nairobi resident, who won Sh36 million last week.&ldquo;I am still happy for this win even though I missed the Mega Jackpot win. I shall keep trying until I get lucky,&rdquo; said the happy gamer.Chepchilat, a tea picker who works in Kericho said on a good day he earns Sh300. &ldquo;The highest amount of money I have ever held or had in my entire life is Sh80,000. This is the first time I will hold millions in my account,&rdquo; he said happily.&ldquo;I would like to thank God for this win and tell others that SportPesa is real and payments are immediate,&rdquo; he added. The SportPesa client started betting in August after his friend won Sh3,700 from playing the Multi Bet games.SportPesa Chief Marketing Officer Kester Shimonyo congratulated Chepchilat for the win and urged him to spend the money wisely. &ldquo;We are ready to help him with financial advisory as well as legal services. The idea is to ensure that the money enriches the lives of our customers so we take great caution to protect them from any exploitation,&rdquo; said Shimonyo. Chepchilat said he places bets using the recently launched SportPesa USSD service which is free as the area he comes from has limited internet connection.
