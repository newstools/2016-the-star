Education CS Fred Matiangi has extended the tenure of Moi University acting vice chancellor Laban Ayiro for another three month. In a letter dated December 9, he said this will provide stability at the university and give its council time to recruit a substantive VC. He said the university is undergoing a transformation, hence the need for stability in management.Ayiro was appointed acting VC in September, sparking protests from political leaders in the North Rift, led by governors Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu and Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet. The two argued that Prof Isaac Kosgey emerged the best during recruitment interviews. Mandago and other political leaders stormed the university and demanded Kosgey be appointed VC.This means that the interviews in which Kosgey is said to have emerged top have been effectively cancelled and a fresh hiring will begin.
