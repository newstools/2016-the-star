President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged cooperatives to support the government&rsquo;s industrialisation efforts by encouraging farmers to add value to their produce.He yesterday said value addition will ensure farmers earn more. Uhuru cited Othaya farmers who make good returns because of adding value to their coffee. &ldquo;When I toured Nyeri recently, I met Othaya farmers who are now earning Sh80 per kilo of coffee because of value addition unlike other areas where most farmers are still earning a meagre Sh20,&rdquo; Uhuru said when he met cooperatives officials. He said the cooperatives are intertwined with the agriculture sector and should work together. Uhuru said value addition will also create jobs. He said cooperatives were placed under the Industrialisation ministry to ensure farmers participate in the process.
