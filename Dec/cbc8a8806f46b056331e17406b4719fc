Four politicians from Kakamega county have dismissed the proposed plans by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli to name a Luhya spokesperson.Atwoli has not held wide consultations on the choice, said Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali, former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed, Stanley Livondo and Marama West MCA Habil Bushuru.Speaking separately, they accused Atwoli of harbouring a hidden agenda. &ldquo;I am a key politician in this region but I have not been consulted by my elder brother Francis Atwoli to discuss who should carry the Luhya flag. I have also talked to some senior politicians and they don&rsquo;t have any idea about the proposed unveiling of the community spokesperson. This indicates the plan is a one-man idea,&rdquo; Washiali said.&ldquo;As much as I wish that our community gets a spokesperson, that person should not be a presidential candidate. We want a neutral person who will help in uniting the community.&rdquo;Speaking at the Mumias East CDF office on Monday, Washiali said the search for the community&rsquo;s spokesperson should be open &ldquo;so that we get a leader full of wisdom, with no political affiliations, to spearhead the unity quest of our community&rdquo;.Mohamed said as much as they respect Atwoli, he should not bulldoze the community for his own benefit.&ldquo;How can a community with the second-largest population in the country be represented by one person in decision-making? Let Atwoli not impose his friend on the community,&rdquo; he said.Bushuru said Western is a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of quality leaders who need to be consulted first. He cited Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, Cyrus Jirongo, and religious leaders such retired ACK archbishop Eliud Wabukala. He said there should be wide consultations to pick a trustworthy leader.
