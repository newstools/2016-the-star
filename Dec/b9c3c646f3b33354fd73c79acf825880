Kakamega patients will suffer more after the county&rsquo;s general hospital was closed, as the doctors and nurses&rsquo; nationwide strike entered day three yesterday.Patients who were in wards were discharged on Monday to seek treatment in private hospitals. However, reports from the hospital administration indicated some patients have been locked inside the facility.&ldquo;There are patients here. Ward Nine is full. Immobilised patients, such as those nursing serious fractures, are here but are not receiving treatment,&rdquo; said a source from the hospital. Ward Nine holds mentally ill patients.But county Health executive Penninah Mukabane denied the claim. She said there was no patient at the facility. Mukabane also denied initial reports that patients with bills had been detained at the facility for fear they would not return to pay their bills if released.The source told the Star patients who can afford private hospital charges are transported to those of their choice.The media was blocked from getting into the compound. &ldquo;Patients will continue to suffer at home because most of them are poor and cannot afford the high charges in private hospitals,&rdquo; nominated MCA Alex Khamasi said.A spot check by the Star in most hospitals revealed they remained closed and patients kept away.In September, Kakamega nurses and doctors from public hospitals went on strike. They accused the county of intimidation, discrimination and failing to promote them.Then, patients had the option of going to other counties. They mainly sought help from the Busia County Hospital, which became overcrowded. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said they accepted them on humanitarian grounds.
