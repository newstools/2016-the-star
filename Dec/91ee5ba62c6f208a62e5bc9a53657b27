Omondi, on the other hand has an ankle injury.Spedag coach Christine Nanjala has admitted it is unfortunate they will miss the three key players at this crucial stage where they are muscling up with reigning FKF champions Thika Queens for the sole spot ahead of the play -off.&ldquo;Akida, Akinyi and Omondi are good players and its sad we won&rsquo;t have them when it matters the most. However, we will not let their absence tie us down. We are in this competition to see to it that we emerge top of Zone &lsquo;A&rsquo;.&rdquo;Nanjala added: &rdquo;We defeated them 9-0 at home in the first leg but we will not be overconfident ahead of the tie. We hope to stage a good performance and hopefully emerge the winners. We have only one match remaining against Mombasa Olympic to decide who qualify for the play-offs and we want to be that team.&rdquo;The tactician however said she will field Mildred Cheche in the absence of Akida, and Miceta Waweru will start between the posts for the mourning Akinyi.&ldquo;In the midfield where Omondi plays, we have a variety of players to choose from and so we will just have to wait and see. As for Cheche and Waweru they have been impressive in training and we look forward to the tie.&rdquo;Away in Thika, Thika Queens will welcome Soccer Queens at the Thika Stadium . The winner in Zone A will play the already qualified zoned B winners Oserian in the play -off.
