Cord leader Raila Odinga has cautioned Nyanza ODM leaders against hiring youths to cause chaos in rallies, saying this would jeopardise his presidential ambitions.He said if leaders fail to maintain peace during their campaigns, the chaos rocking rallies in Nyanza are likely to be an impediment to his State House bid.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like my own people are not concerned about my presidential bid. They know very well that by engaging in unnecessary political squabbles, this will scuttle my presidential ambitions,&rdquo; Raila said. He spoke in Bondo constituency on Sunday. He said unnecessary political quarrels should not be tolerated.The former Prime Minister said divisive politics along clan lines are some of the stumbling blocks in getting support from other communities. &ldquo;Other regions are ready to back my presidential bid, but politicians from my own backyard are busy fighting each other and propagating clannism over unnecessary reasons,&rdquo; he said.Raila said he has struggled and managed to get the backing of almost every part of Kenya, but such needless political fights in Nyanza are likely to bring him down.The region has experienced violent political animosities. Last year, Siaya Governor Rasanga was attacked in Yala by youths used by rivals.Still in Siaya in mid this year, Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo was attacked in Nyadorera.The opposition chief asked politicians from Nyanza with resources to marshal support for him across the country, instead of creating chaos.Raila urged everyone to work for peace and unity, exuding confidence that he will beat President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party with a landslide. &ldquo;I enjoy support from the people of Coast, Eastern, Northeastern, Western, Nyanza and the Rift Valley,&rdquo; Raila said.
