The 10th edition of Eastern Africa University Games set for December 16-20 at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology have so far attracted 4000 participants.The event, which is staged after every two years, has attracted universities from neighbours Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and hosts Kenya. EAUG secretary general, Simon Munai, observed the number could still go up if universities from Ethiopia and South Sudan, who had shown interest confirm participation.&ldquo;The preparations to host the event are in top gear and we can only hope for the best. We last staged a successful competition in 2010 with 2000 participants and since then, the numbers have been on rise. The development goes along way to show that the games have gained ground,&rdquo; said Munai. He added: &ldquo;Besides bringing together these universities drawn from across the region to compete in various disciplines, the event also acts as a point of Integration which is imperative for the students,&rdquo;Munai said some of the games will be held at the Kenyatta University and University of Nairobi to enable the competition run as scheduled.&ldquo;We are happy to be awarded another chance to stage the event and we are doing everything possible to ensure we stage a successful competition and that&rsquo;s why we want to have some of the events staged at the Kenyatta University and University of Nairobi. Participants arrive on December 15 and the opening ceremony is set for December 16,&rdquo; he added.
