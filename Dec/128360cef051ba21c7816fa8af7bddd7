Migori Governor Zachary Okoth has denied having any corruption cases pending in court.He faulted reports in the media that he is among politicians who have corruption cases.The reports are baseless and have no proof, Obado said.&ldquo;The media should tell people the truth and should not be used to tarnish the reputation of leaders,&rdquo; he said.Obado added that he has not received any communication from any agency or court that he faces graft charges or that he should go to court.&ldquo;I am asking these media groups fuelling this propaganda to give me this letter inviting me to go to court to answer certain charges, so that I go,&rdquo; he said.The governor said the Auditor General&rsquo;s report released recently is a document that requires the respective counties to respond to the queries therein.It is not an indication that the governors are already corrupt, he said.&ldquo;This is a report that requires us to respond. And we are in the process of doing that because, to my best knowledge, we have not stolen anything from the county kitty and media must understand this,&rdquo; Obado added.The county boss, however, appealed to the political leaders to embrace sobriety instead of engaging in dirty politics for their own selfish gain.In November, several media reported on the Auditor General&rsquo;s queries on Migori county.The Auditor General questioned various expenditure, including travel, accommodation and per diem expenses. The auditor also questioned procurement procedures, overspending on salaries and paying ghost workers.Last month, reports said DPP Keriako Tobiko forwarded a file to the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission, recommending that Obado be investigated over graft allegations, following queries on expenditure dating back to 2014.Reports indicated he could face prosecution over graft allegations.
