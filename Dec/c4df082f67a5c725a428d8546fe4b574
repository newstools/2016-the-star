The CJ, LSK and Cord also have legal mandates based on their offices. You're not only one with legislative powers," Everlyne Shilaho said.User Peter Santoni &rlm;said: "Duale honestly, I don't think you listen to yourself sometimes when you speak. Who are you to intimidate a judge?"While some users asked the legislator to seek for medical attention, others maintained that they will not back a manual system of identifying voters."@HonAdenDuale you need to see a medical doctor.You have a problem with your mind and mouth. Kenyans are not fools the way you take them. We want peace," pokwako said.George Mbewa &rlm;said: "@HonAdenDuale Unfortunately the doctors are still on strike... Who will save this country from these kind of madness,"Other users asked Duale to stop being a bully and instead focus on taking Kenya to a new level."@HonAdenDuale there is difference between exercising parliamentary responsibly and being a bully. Yours is exercising arrogantly," Kwandablagok said.Another user &rlm;said: "@honadenduale Ata kama ni kukua [even if it is being] a strong Jubilee supporter, not to that level man. The sooner you will realise what you are doing the better,""@HonAdenDuale there is difference between exercising parliamentary responsibly and being a bully. Yours is exercising arrogantly," Dennis Kerage said.There were also a host of twitter users who supported Duale's assertions."@HonAdenDuale, go on.This judge needs to be investigated.
