Hundreds of Kenyan children could be dying unnecessarily from diseases that are easily prevented through vaccines, experts warn.They now want concrete actions to stem the tide of vaccine-preventable diseases across the continent.The call came from the African Regional Immunisation Technical Advisory Group, which recently met to discuss the state of immunisation in Africa.According to the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, about two of every three Kenyan children are considered &ldquo;fully immunised.&rdquo;While this is an important accomplishment, experts say the work is not complete until every child is fully immunised against preventable diseases.&ldquo;We know that immunisation is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions and that ensuring universal access can drive real progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. We&rsquo;ve made good progress &ndash; but now is the time to up our game,&rdquo; said Dr Awa Marie Coll-Seck, Senegal&rsquo;s Minister of Health when Ritag met.The Ritag serves as the principal advisory group to the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, on regional immunisation policies and programmes.The group noted that while Africa has made tremendous gains towards increasing access to immunisation in the last 15 years, progress has stagnated, leaving one in five of African children without access to life-saving vaccines.As a result, vaccine-preventable diseases still claim too many lives. Measles alone accounts for approximately 61,000 preventable deaths in the region every year.Over the course of the meeting, group members explored a range of pressing issues, including the recent yellow fever epidemic in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; progress towards eliminating measles, rubella and maternal and neonatal tetanus; as well as polio eradication efforts, including planning for adequate, uninterrupted financing of immunization services once eradication programs ramp down.In Kenya, the 2014 KDHS illustrates the challenge of immunisation inequity.In contrast to the nation as a whole, only 41 per cent of children in the North Eastern region are fully vaccinated, and within that region, only 27.7 per cent of the children in Mandera County, the second poorest among Kenya&rsquo;s 47 counties.
