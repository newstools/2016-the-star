President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said nothing will distract him from his determination to transform the lives of Kenyans and move the country forward. The President assured that he will work tirelessly to ensure the development momentum the country has attained is not slowed down by the rhetoric and divisive politics of the opposition, noting that the Jubilee Government has implemented development projects in all parts of the country. “Our main focus is to make Kenya a better place than we found it,” President Kenyatta said. Uhuru spoke at P.C.E.A. Kimunyu, where he presided over the ground breaking ceremony of the proposed Thiririka Presbytery office complex. Uhuru urged Kenyans not to be anxious about the elections.
