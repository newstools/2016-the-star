Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i is easily the CS of the Year 2016 in the minds of millions of Kenyans, given his massive campaign to restore the credibility and integrity of primary and secondary national examinations.Matiang&rsquo;i was not alone in making the 2016 KCPE and KCSE examinations easily the most credible and least tainted since at least the mid-1960s. But his vision, voice, activity and energy were preeminent.Perhaps it helped that he is a member of a Cabinet that features only two active politicians and whose emphasis is on technocracy. In a council of ministers that lost five members in an anti-corruption purge, Matiang&rsquo;i stands out for his principled stand on restoring the glory of the examinations system.This year&rsquo;s KCPE and KSCE exams were held under tough new guidelines and tight security provided by armed police in a partnership of the Education and Interior ministries.For the first time in decades, there was no cheating in these national rite-of-passage formative education examinations.
