A petition has been filed at the Malindi High Court to compel the Ministry of Defence and that of Transport to pay Sh10 billion for a piece of land in Mariakani.The two ministries were sued after they failed to compensate owners of the 1,656.7 hectares of land situated along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Ramadhan Mwatsahu, Mohamed Yama, Hamisi Mwatsahu, Buru Nyota and members of the Mwandaza Mwachanda welfare moved to court on December 22 over the matter.They presented documents showing they are the real owners of the piece of land and have listed Kilifi county government as one of the respondents.Other respondents in the case include National Land Commission and the Attorney General.The petitioners say that they have an ancestral claim over the said parcel of land and also produced documents showing restraining orders issued by the Mombasa High court against any form of encroachment on the land.In the fist suit filed in 2011, the group accused the Defence Ministry of taking up some 3000 acres of the disputed piece of land, whereas the ministry of land took up some 50 acres.The petitioners argued that the said ministries have not paid any compensation to the rightful owners before and after the acquisition.They further informed the court that they were granted letters of administration to the estate by the late Ali Mwadzaya.This was through a succession case at the Mombasa High Court before the latter's death in 1980.In his affidavit, Yama said the respondents jointly encroached the piece of land without compensating them."The respondents acquisition of the parcels of lands belonging to the petitioners without compensation violates Article 40 of the Constitution of Kenya," he stated.Yama said it would be fair if the respondents compensated them for the portion of land they encroached and that the National land commission issue a title deed to them to avoid further encroachment.
