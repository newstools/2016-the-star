President Uhuru Kenyatta has moved the coordination of the NGO sector to the Ministry of Interior in what is likely to open a new battlefront with the civil society.In a directive dated October 28, just a week after Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri sent NGO Coordination Board executive director Fazul Mohamed on compulsory leave, Uhuru ordered the transfer of the sector to the Interior ministry.This means the policy coordination of the sector will be headed by Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.In March, Uhuru appointed ex-police commissioner Hussein Ali, his former co-accused at the ICC, as the chair of the NGO Coordination Board.Kiunjuri has informed NGOs that the sector is no longer domiciled in his ministry and, therefore, he cannot set and gazette the date of entry into force of the Public Benefit Organizations Act 2013 as was directed by court.&ldquo;In this regard, we would request you to liaise with the State Department of Interior on all matters pertaining to the Public Benefits Organisation,&rdquo; Kiunjuri wrote to Suba Churchill, Coordinator of the National Civil Society Congress.The PBO Act 2013 gives the non-profit sector, including NGOs and charities, total independence and protection.But the civil society players on Friday termed the government move as illegal, saying according to the law, the sector should fall under a ministry responsible for development and planning.&ldquo;Practically, NGOs are not a security issue. Unless the Jubilee government is saying that as far as they are concerned NGO constitute a serious security threat,&rdquo; Suba said.National Civil Society Congress President Morris Odhiambo said the move is meant to intimidate them. &ldquo;The transfer will be seen by a number of NGOs as declaration of war because it&rsquo;s just coming before the elections.It will definitely be interpreted as a move to control the sector,&rdquo; Ir&#361;ng&#361; Houghton, Associate Director of the Society for International Development, told the Star.Read:Foreigners plotting regime change in Kenya - Uhuru
