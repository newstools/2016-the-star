Communities living in Isiolo county should maintain peace to pave way for development and education, Ahadi Kenya CEO Stanley Kamau has said. The communities have been involved in tribal and clan wars and cattle theft, leaving residents poor, causing loss of lives, property and livestock. Kamau said development will be achieved only when the communities coexist. He spoke in Chumvi Yere village when he delivered a food and shoes donation from the Ahadi Kenya Trust and the Lotto Foundation. &ldquo;Time for tribal wars is long gone and people are currently focusing on development,&rdquo; Kamau said. He urged the county government to address the problems that lead to the perennial conflicts. The CEO urged politicians to shun violence, especially during elections. Governor Godana Doyo&rsquo;s wife Madina Doyo thanked the organisations for their donations. &ldquo;As people living in this county, we should enjoy and celebrate our cultural diversities. The county government is focussed on ensuring peace,&rdquo; she said.
