The Mombasa government has engaged an Estonian firm to develop a traffic management system to end traffic snarl-ups.The company has sent a representative, who is working in Transport executive Tawfiq Balala&rsquo;s office.&ldquo;We are borrowing from their expertise. We have one of their representatives in my office, who is constantly giving me advice on what needs to be done,&rdquo; Balala said on Friday.Trucks into and out of Mombasa frequently cause massive traffic snarl-ups, especially at Jomvu.A pilot software developed by the firm will be rolled out in January, Balala said.The software is a queue management system that will manage the number of trucks entering and leaving Mombasa at a time.An average of 5,000 trucks enter and leave Mombasa with no specific time schedules, causing traffic snarl-ups.&ldquo;We will spread the entry and exit of trucks throughout 24 hours. Every hour we will give a time slot of a certain number of trucks depending on how busy the port is,&rdquo; Balala said.
