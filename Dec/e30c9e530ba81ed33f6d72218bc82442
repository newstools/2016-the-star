A British sex slave has told the horrific story of how she was abducted at 15 by an Asian taxi driver as a vulnerable teen and endured 13 years of horrendous abuse.Anna Ruston claims that her captor raped her repeatedly, prostituted her out to other men, and 'sold' the four babies she had during the terrible ordeal.She was forced to go to the toilet in a can in the corner of the room, and is still haunted by the smell of it and the odour of garlic on her captor. During the 13 years of abuse, she said she lived with taxi driver 'Malik' and his mother, his brothers and their wives, but no-one did anything to help her. The wives, who she claims were also being abused, would cover up the bruises around her eyes with make-up and occasionally give her painkillers.'I can still see that bedroom, the corner where I would rock in pain. Although after a while I stopped feeling pain, I think my body shut down,' she told The Mirror. Her story has chilling echoes of the case of the shocking case of Elisabeth Fritzl, who was held captive in an underground bunker for 28 years by her father Josef.She had seven children while raised in the dungeon in Austria in a case that sent shockwaves around the world, but it had already happened to Anna here in Britain. And worryingly, Miss Ruston, whose name has been altered for her safety, says it 'could be happening on any street' in the UK.'As a vulnerable teen, living with a friend after her grandmother died and her parents would not support her, Malik knew no-one would miss her, she claims.In her new book Secret Slave, which she was advised to write for her own therapy, she explains how, with no close family, she latched on to his affection.He paid her attention and invited her to his home, where she enjoyed milky tea and chapattis and was welcomed by his family. But he suddenly turned on her with sickening ferocity, calling her a 'white s***', raping her then locking the door, which he repeated almost every night for 13 years.She explained how she was overjoyed when she first fell pregnant, writing 'When you feel a baby move in your stomach you feel you have someone with you, you are not alone.'He would stop beating her during pregnancy, but the hope of having a child quickly faded when he quickly took her first son away. She barely got to hold any of her babies and fears that he 'sold them', she claims. Miss Ruston also explains how she felt 'let down' by the authorities, who she claims were afraid to help her for fear of being accused of discrimination.The claim has concerning echoes of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, in which authorities repeatedly failed to address warning signs about Asian sex gangs due to similar concerns. Anna said: 'Malik dressed me in his culture&rsquo;s clothes, dyed my hair black, made me wear a scarf and keep my head down. When he spoke for me they thought it was a cultural thing. And I think people are scared to be accused of &shy;discrimination.'She explained how she attempted to flee from the back door but was beaten badly afterwards, which made her too afraid to try and escape again.Even now, she is too scared to report her captor to the police, even though officers have told her another girl will come forward with similar allegations if she makes a statement.She even tried to choke herself with a scarf but at the height of her depression, it was a health visitor who came to see her because she weighed just six stone that saved her.Miss Ruston found the courage to slip her a piece of paper begging for help at a time when she knew the family would be busy with Muslim festival Eid.The health visitor handed one back promising to wait outside and ring the house phone three times.When she heard the phone, she ran for help and fortune was on her side as the key had unusually been left in the front door while the family were busy with prayers.Since then, she has rebuilt her life with the childhood flame that she had dated when she was a teenager and thought of constantly during her captivity.He was pleased to see her when they bumped into each other, but it took years for her to tell him the truth about what had really happened to her.The couple now live together with her four children and she has been free for 16 years, but she will always wonder what happened to the four that were taken away from her.
