Nakuru governor hopeful John Mututho (pictured) has picked a running mate from Deputy Governor Joseph Rutto&rsquo;s doorstep in Kuresoi South constituency. The former Naivasha MP on Saturday said he has picked Maureen Chebet, 26, to ensure what Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and Rutto failed to do &ldquo;is done swiftly&rdquo;. Mututho said he has enough experience and vision to run the county. &ldquo;Both the youth and women have been ignored by the county leadership,&rdquo; he said. Chebet has pledged to represent the minority in the county. &ldquo;As a mother and a youth, my aim is to ensure that all who have been neglected by this leadership are served,&rdquo; she said. Chebet said Kuresoi, where Rutto comes from, has been sidelined in the distribution of county projects. Mututho said some towns in the region do not have hospitals, streetlights and public toilets.
