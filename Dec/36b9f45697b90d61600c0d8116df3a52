The secessionist Mombasa Republican Council has reversed itself, saying it will not try to bar the IEBC from the region. It said it does not intend to cause mayhem before, during or after the 2017 polls. Deputy spokesperson Richard Lewa on Wednesday said their secession campaign will be carried out within the law. He said they will not obstruct the IEBC. &ldquo;Only courts can stop them. We do not run the courts. We only seek their help, advice and interpretation,&rdquo; Lewa said. He said they recognise the region&rsquo;s economy depends on tourism and would never cause residents physical, psychological or economic harm.&ldquo;We are still in Kenya, under jurisdiction of the Kenyan government and so we will use Kenyan law and if we break it we will be subject to punishment stipulated by law,&rdquo; Lewa said. This is the first time the group has publicly admitted the Coast is part of Kenya. Its slogan is &lsquo;Pwani si Kenya&rsquo;.
