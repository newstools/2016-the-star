A businessman arrested in connection with the eviction of a family and destruction of their home in Westlands was charged on Friday with forgery, fraud and malicious damage to Sh30 million property. Francis Njeru (pictured) of Frank Logistics appeared before Nairobi senior principal magistrate Charity Oluoch. He denied the charges and was released on Sh1 million bail pending the hearing on February 8. Njeru allegedly hired goons to demolish a house whose lease had expired and claimed it had changed ownership and belonged to him. It is said the complainant, the Kurji family, was evicted from their home by a group of men armed with pangas and rungus. The Kurjis had lived in the house for more than 40 years. Njeru is also accused of obtaining registration of land by false pretences and conspiring to defraud the family of the land worth Sh30 million.
