The Motorists Association of Kenya has blamed the Naivasha tragedy where about 40 people were burned to death on alleged irregular erection of a bump on the road at Karai, Naivasha.In a statement on Sunday, the association said the bump was unnecessary and ''It was just a matter of time, perhaps, before they reaped what they intended by erecting the bump.""Many questions have been asked and blame apportioned. However, It was not an accident because God never erected the sign-less and crudely constructed unmarked killer bump in the middle of a busy international highway," MAK chairman Peter Murima said.This comes as leaders and Kenyans mourned the death of about 40 people following a horrible accident on Saturday night at Karai, Naivasha.Read: At least 40 dead in grisly road accident on Nairobi-Nakuru highwayDeputy President William Ruto on Sunday urged motorists to be cautious and adhere to traffic rules to avoid deaths, pain and suffering."My heartfelt condolences to the families that have lost loved ones following the tragic accident at Karai, Naivasha.
