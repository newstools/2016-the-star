Kenya Airways has introduced a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on the Mombasa route in a bid to take up more passengers heading to the Coast region during the festive season.Chris Diaz, director of communications, said on Thursday that the airline will also deploy a Boeing 787 on December 23 and 24 following the high traffic expected at that time.The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has 234 seats of which 30 are of the Premier Class and 204 being of the Economy Class.The capacity of the plane is higher than the Embraer 190 of 96-passenger capacity that normally plies the route.The Boeing 787 Dreamliner will also operate the route on January 2 and January 3," Diaz said."We have seen increased demand on the Mombasa route ahead of the festive season necessitating the need to increase capacity," he added.Diaz said Kenya Airways plays a major role in boosting the economy of Mombasa during the festive season when demand mainly driven by the domestic market increases.Kenya Airways normally operates 10 flights on the Nairobi to Mombasa route daily and has also seen increased bookings on the Kisumu route.The airline has been grappling with challenges that has seen most of its flights delayed over pilots and engineers' go-slow.Read: Kenya Airways bleeds talent as &lsquo;technical&rsquo; hitches delay flights
