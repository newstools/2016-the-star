The government has been urged to stop victimising universities offering genuine degrees, following reports some politicians are awarded degrees they do not qualify for. Mbalambala MP Abdikadir Adan said the Education ministry should conduct proper investigations. He said vilifying universities makes them appear as if they collude with politicians accused of &lsquo;buying&rsquo; degrees.Aden was speaking at Gretsa University, Thika, during the seventh graduation ceremony on Thursday. He sponsored 200 students at the institution. The MP said the government should support credible institutions, which ensure politicians acquire genuine degrees.&ldquo;It is so unfortunate that any university where a politician has graduated from is being victimised and investigated as no one believes that politicians can go back to school,&rdquo; he said. Gretsa University vice chancellor Dr Kibathi Mwangi said the institution has ensured all the politicians have completed their studies and attained the required grades before graduating. &ldquo;Corruption and issuing fake degrees to politicians is not in our DNA,&rdquo; he said.
