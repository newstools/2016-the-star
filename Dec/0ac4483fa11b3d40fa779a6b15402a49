MPs have questioned why Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge has not ensured his officers linked to the collapse of three banks are prosecuted.Njoroge, who appeared before the National Assembly Finance Committee was at pains to convince the MPs why no CBK officer implicated in the collapse of Chase, Imperial and Dubai banks has not been sacked or prosecuted, almost a year since he assumed office.The committee chaired by Ainamoi MP Benjamin Langat raised concern that the officers may be interfering with ongoing forensic audit commissioned by the CBK, to unearth culprits who fleeced depositors. We thought in this investigation you could start with your own house. Keeping the officers could be interfering with the investigations, Langat said.Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja demanded that Njoroge should confirm whether the CBK has ever conducted a serious investigation into its officers. I am not saying that CBK employees were not involved in the collapse of the banks, but as at now we have no evidence to sack any officer, Njorogesaid. The officers are not going anywhere. They are going to be in this country and even if they retire we will pursue them for prosecution when there is enough evidence. Njoroge was also put to task to explain why he commissioned an audit on Chase Bank while it was under receivership.Langat poked holes into the audit report on Chase Bank presented to his committee mid this year, alleging it had conflict of interest. At this point I cannot fully and satisfactorily answer the question why I appointed the auditor. Considering conflict of interest, I thought there would be firewalls in auditing, Njoroge said. He appeared before the committee to share findings of the forensic audit report on the affected banks.The CBK governor, however, did not share the findings with the committee on grounds it is difficult to come up with one report for the three banks.Chase Bank will be pulled out of receivership next year, Njoroge said.
