The High Court has directed Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo to present herself before the OCS Parliament police station to record a statement in a case where she is seeking anticipatory bond for her remarks in parliament over the presidency.Justice James Wakiaga made the directive after the DPP said he was not ready to proceed with the matter.Justice Wakiaga said the MP should be accompanied by her lawyers and that the police should not arrest her on the way.However, Wakiaga disqualified himself from hearing the matter saying he comes from the constituency that the MP represents. The matter will be placed before the duty judge on January 10.Senior assistant DPP Moses Omirera told the court that it was not clear whether it was the police or strangers who were trailing the legislator.The legislator, on December 21, made the remarks after police ordered police to walk to parliament as cars were not allowed within the precincts.She said: "Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is a fake President, as his own backyard is poor,""We have come here prepared for death and we are going to Canaan not back to Egypt," the legislator said ahead of the stormy debate on election laws at the National Assembly.Read: [VIDEO] Kenyans react to Millie Odhiambo's remarks that Uhuru is 'a fake President'More of this: [VIDEO] Parliament buildings blockaded by police, MPs forced to walk ahead of IEBC sitting
