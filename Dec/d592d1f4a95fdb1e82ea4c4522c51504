THE number of students who scored straight As drastically declined in the 2016 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations compared to a year ago.This follows stringent rules implemented by Education CS Fred Matiang'i, who in a surprise move released the results two months earlier than is traditional.From a high of 2,636, only 141 students scored straight As, where 574,125 students sat the exams.The CS noted some schools that had a high of over 200 students with straight As in last year's exam could not manage even two.&ldquo;There were 141 candidates, which is 0.02 per cent, who obtained an overall mean Grade A in the 2016 KCSE examinations compared to 2,685, which represented 0.51 per cent, in 2015,&rdquo; said Matiang&rsquo;i during the low-key ceremony.Releasing the results at Shimo la Tewa Secondary School in Mombasa, the CS said that girls outshone boys, scooping 16 out of the 20 best positions.The CS commended Alliance Girls&rsquo; High School and Kenya High School for maintaining their achievement of top mean grades in the national examinations through the years.&ldquo;Alliance Girls had 25 candidates obtaining a mean grade of A Plain, the same as last year, while Kenya High had 21 candidates with mean grade of A Plain, one more than last year,&rdquo; said Matiang&rsquo;i.This means that of the 141 candidates who scored straight As, 46 were from Kenya High and Alliance Girls&rsquo; High, according to the CS.Despite the number of girls being lower than the boys in the last seven years, the girl-child has been performing better compared than boys.He said girls&rsquo; enrolment in school has also been increasing.Out of the 47 counties, 11 counties had more female candidates than male in the 2016 KCSE exams, meaning that the regions are doing a good job in enrolling girls in the education system, said the CS.The counties that had more female than male candidates in the 2016 KCSE examination included Taita Taveta, Kwale, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang&rsquo;a, Kiambu, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Uasin Gishu and Vihiga.&ldquo;Although we do encourage all children to be enrolled in the school system, more effort is needed to break the cultural and regional barriers that have traditionally kept the girl-child out of school,&rdquo; he said.The CS said all the candidates who had a mean grade of C+ and above will be enrolled in public universities.The number of candidates with the minimum university entry qualification of mean Grade C+ and above was 88,929, which is 15.41 per cent.Last year, 169,492 students, 32.23 per cent, scored C+ and above.In 2015, some 11,618 students scored A minuses but the number fell to 4,645 in 2016.Of those who sat the exam this year, 300,995 were male and 273,130 were female, representing 52.43 per cent and 47.57 per cent of the total candidature respectively.According to Matiang&rsquo;i the poorer grades in KCSE were because of the strict measures that were put in place to curb cheating.He said there was not a single incident of cheating in the exams, compared to 2015, when 5,101 candidates lost their results.&ldquo;This is confirmation that various security measures put in place during the administration and management of the 2016 KCSE Examinations helped to nip in the bud any forms of cheating,&rdquo; he said.The KCSE exams were taken in 9,154 centres across the country, compared to 8,646 centres in 2015.This represents an increase of 508 examination centres, or 5.88 per cent.The English and Kiswahili languages were the most poorly done subjects in the 2016 KCSE exams.This is because the two subjects recorded the most significant decline compared to last year&rsquo;s results.In 2015, Alternative Mathematics B, History and Government and CRE were the most poorly done subjects.Art and Design, Woodwork and Drawing and Design recorded the most significant improvement compared to the 2015 KCSE exams.Computer Studies and Kenya Sign Language also registered significant improvement.The improvement in Computer Studies is significant to the Jubilee government, coming at a time the government embraces the Digital Literacy Programme and improves the electricity connection in schools across the country, especially in the rural areas.Mathematics Alternative B and Biology for the Blind registered no significant improvement.This could be the reason for a decline in performance in the main subjects, including English, Kiswahili, Mathematics Alternative A, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, General Sciences, History and Government, Geography and CRE.Earlier on at State House Mombasa, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed that, beginning next year, the Kenya National Examinations Council should cease the use of index numbers.Instead, Uhuru directed the Ministry to ensure all registered examination candidates have unique personal identifiers (UPIs) in Student Registration Numbers (SRNs) that they will use throughout their presence, at all levels, in the Kenya education system.President Kenyatta congratulated the team for delivering credible results, noting that the Jubilee administration&rsquo;s reform plan of restoring the integrity of the Kenyan national examinations system has progressed at a commendable pace.Matiang'i said the results were a true reflection of the performance of the candidates. He said there were cases of attempted breach of rules and the said cases had been forwarded to the Teacher&rsquo;s Service Commission for disciplinary measures. He said the ministry fully supports the decision taken by the teachers' employer.&ldquo;Even during the marking, we noted some two or three cases of teachers trying some malpractices. We duly removed them and handed their details to TSC,&rdquo; he said.Matiang'i said the Council contracted some 74,810 professionals compared with 2015, when 51,717 were engaged. The professionals included 9,468 supervisors, 33,159 invigilators, 19,698 security officers, 2,290 drivers, 9,157 centre managers (principals), 346 sub-county commissioners and 692 education officers.Matiang'i also warned head teachers to adhere to the school fees structures issued by the government &ldquo;to ensure that all Kenyans irrespective of their backgrounds have unrestricted access to education&rdquo;.
