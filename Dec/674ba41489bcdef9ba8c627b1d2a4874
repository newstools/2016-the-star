The government has blamed the doctor's union for the 'illegal strike' that commenced on December 5,2016.Spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the union was offered good packages but instead it has not stopped the strike."Government has offered two good packages but KMPDU has not bothered to respond. The government is prepared to sit with doctors to resolve the matter before the year's end," he said."The ongoing doctors' strike is a very 'unfortunate' occurrence."Kiraithe appealed to the "professional doctors" who do not want to strike to continue with the work, adding "we will provide security"."One of my staff found doctors in Kisumu and other areas quietly offering services. We will secure those who want to be free from recalcitrant officials who don't want to obey the courts," he said.Noting that they are committed to the union, Kiraithe said they will create a lee way for the professionals to continue providing services."We want them to do their work in a structured way," he added.On December 13, the Labour Relations court declared the doctors strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately.The court directed union officials to call off the strike that has contributed to the deaths of over 20 people.Health workers countrywide downed their tools saying it would be the longest in Kenya's history.More on this: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreementUnions are demanding a 300 per cent pay increment for doctors, and 25 to 40 per cent rise for nurses.They said they had signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement with the government in 2013 but that it is yet to be implemented.Read: Health crisis deepens as private hospitals prepare to join doctors' strikeThe government had offered a Sh50,000 increase for the lowest paid doctors, which would raise their salaries to Sh176,000, but unions rejected it and walked out of talks.President Uhuru Kenyatta also urged doctors to return to work promising that a solution would be found.More on this: Uhuru urges striking doctors to return to work, pledges to resolve row
