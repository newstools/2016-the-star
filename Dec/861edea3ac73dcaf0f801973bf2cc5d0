Lack of friends spurred Victor Odhiambo, 15, to concentrate on his studies and emerge tops nationally in the KCPE exam.He also used to put his feet in a basin of cold water to keep him awake, so he could study.Victor wants to be a doctor. He told the Star it took him a long time to make friends at the Daisy Special School for the Physically Handicappedand Vocational Training. He moved from Frere School in Nakuru in 2012 when he was in standard five. I thought Daisy was not the school for me and I spent most of my time alone. This gave me time to focus on my studies, Odhiambo said yesterday.He was made to repeat standard five in 2013 at Daisy after teachers said his performance was wanting. Odhiambo has a hearing impairment.He said he accepted his new school after being counselled by his parents, neighbours and teachers.Odhiambo emerged the top KCPE candidate nationally, scoring 437 marks. He scored 97 in English, 99 in Kiswahili, 87 in mathematics, 71 in science and 83 in social studies and religion. I asked my father for books which I read on my own at home. I wanted to score good marks.
