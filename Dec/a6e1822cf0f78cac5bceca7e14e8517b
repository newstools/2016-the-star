Activist Okiya Omtatah yesterday moved to court to stop the government from making further payment of Sh2.6 billion for the acquisition of land in Ruaraka for the expansion of Outer Ring Road. The land, which has been acquired by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, is linked to the General Service Unit headquarters. Omtatah argues that the 37.4 acres is a public land and it is controversial how Afrison Export Import Ltd and Huelands Ltd linked to businessman Francis Mburu acquired it. Court documents indicates the businessman is said to have bought 96 acres in 1981 from Joreth Ltd, which is located at the junction of the Thika Superhighway and Outer Ring Road. His intention was to build 600 housing units for the staff of the former Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. Omtatah said the valuation of the property is a nullity as it did not involve a government valuer.
