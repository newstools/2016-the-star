Controversial Kenyan pastor Victor Kanyari has moved to court in a bid to unfreeze an account under investigation over the 'fake miracles' scam.The pastor, who was exposed in 2013 over fake miracles in exchange of money, wants the High Court to reverse the orders freezing the said personal account. He has sued the Directorate Criminal Investigations which obtained the orders on November 21, 2016 to suspend the account at the Cooperative Bank, River Road branch.Kanyari, who is the husband to gospel singer Betty Bayo, has also sued a magistrates court over the account which he says holds millions of shillings."The orders freezing the account were unreasonably given and have caused me irreparable loss and suffering," the pastor states in an affidavit.While obtaining the orders, investigators told court that they suspect Kanyari was using the account to launder proceeds of crime.Boaz Ogaga, an investigator, said police have received complaints from members of the public who alleged that the wealthy pastor had duped them. The court allowed police to obtain details from the bank including, cash transfer documents made by Kanyari between January 1, 2012 and October 2016.Investigators have also been allowed to question the bank managers over the same. But according to Kanyari, the police did not give court enough prove to show that he committed any offence to warrant the issuance of the orders to investigate and freeze his accounts. "The averments made against me were merely allegations that do not point to any wrong doing," Kanyari adds in the affidavit. He says the court has a duty and powers to access independently and objectively the evidence presented at the magistrate court."...they have a duty to determine if the freezing orders were reasonably given," Kanyari said.Read: Worshipers flock pastor Kanyari church despite fake miracles expose, besieged prophet locks out media
