The Law Society of Kenya has condemned threats by Jubilee MPs against High Court judge George Odunga.Legislators led by Garissa Town's Aden Duale (National Assembly majority leader) had said they would file a motion on Odunga's conduct.They threatened to do so as the judge prepared to rule on Cord's application to stop Parliament from debating the proposed amendments to the election laws.Duale issued a statement on their behalf to the press after passing election laws that had been disputed by their counterparts in the opposition.Through lawyer James Orengo, Cord sought an injunction to quash a gazette notice convening two special sittings by Speaker Justin Muturi, saying it was published after the government's official working hours.But Odunga ruled against Cord and declined to nullify the notice saying the coalition did not give enough reasons.Read more: Cord loses bid to stop special sittings on election lawsLSK president Isaac Okero said the attack was unwarranted, a threat on the independence of the judiciary and integrity of the judge, and an abuse of parliamentary privilege.&ldquo;It is conduct completely untenable in any civilized democracy,&rdquo; he said in a statement.Okero noted Odunga holds an important constitutional office as a judge and a member of the judiciary and that his independence is protected by article 160 (1) of the constitution."His exercise of judicial authority is undertaken on behalf of the people of the republic and therefore cannot, and should not, be subjected to any impediment of any nature,&rdquo; he said.He added that the society was against any attempt to threaten or intimidate the judge or any member of the judiciary.
