Nairobi governor Evans Kidero on Friday stopped "unauthorized promotion" by Kenya Breweries which was to happen outside Jamia Mosque in Nairobi's CBD. Kidero on his facebook page said, "While we respect the need for business to roll out their marketing activities, we must be conscious and not lose sight or respect for principles and beliefs of different religions".On his twitter handle, Kidero said through a hashtag 'keeping our word' that his government was committed to offering better city life to all regardless of their status.Jamia Mosque Committee had written a protest letter to the governor complaining that the event which was to be held from Friday 2nd till 4th was being done with malice and deliberately planned to hurt the sentiments of the members of the Muslim community whose stand against consumption and promotion of alcohol is well known.In the letter seen by the Star, the committee said facilitating the promotion of alcohol right at their doorstep of the mosque was not only an anathema but a provocation to members of the Muslim community."We have gravelly noted that Tusker promotion event by East African Breweries is being organized right outside our mosque. It is well known that due to adverse health and social effects of alcohol consumption, strict regulations aimed at limiting the consumption of alcohol have been enacted in the country and we cannot understand why the county council is going out of its way to encourage its consumption more so at the doorsteps of a religious institution," read a letter addressed to governor Kidero.The letter said the loud noise out of the event would interfere with prayers at the mosque.Demanding that the matter be handled with utmost urgency, the committee appealed to the governor to halt the provocative exercise which was deliberately organized to hurt feelings of Muslims across the country.
