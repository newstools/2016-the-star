Fast-rising Kenyan gospel singer Fenny Fain has attributed his growth to God.The songstress, popularly known for her hit song Huu Wimbo, says that two years down the line after starting out as a professional singer, her faith and trust in God has seen her achieve a lot.Fresh from releasing a new album titled Mano Nyasaye (It's God), Fenny, real name Fain Achieng Aomo, is aiming for more greatness, especially in the new year."I was born and raised in a Christian family, where I started singing at a very tender age. I later joined the adult choir in our church," she explains.She adds, "I have been greatly influenced by both parents, who upto date are still great singers in the church."However, I started recording my music on professional grounds in 2015 when I did a worship song called Mano Nyasaye. It was done in Dholuo dialect."I further went ahead and did more songs among them Adwaro (I Want) and Wastahili, which has seen me grow tremendously as an artiste."But I owe it all to God. My trust and faith in Him has seen my career in music grow from one level to another."I am so grateful to Him and I have such a great belief in Him to elevate me more and more, especially in 2017."Watch Wastahili below:;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
