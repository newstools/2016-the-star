ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday faced resistance from residents of Mumias town after he dismissed projects launched by the Jubilee administration.Mudavadi had accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of launching projects that were not budgeted for during his tour of Western region last week.Speaking at the Bishop Hannington ACK church in Mumias, the former deputy prime minister said all projects launched by the president in his tour of the region were fake.&ldquo;The projects are not reflected in the national budget and will not take off. Let the president desist from playing divisive politics with the people of Western region. It is wrong for the Head of State to lie to Kenyans in the name of launching projects when in real sense it is mere public relations,&rdquo; said Mudavadi.He asked the people of Western region to reject Jubilee and support the National Super Alliance (NASA).But former ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed and politician Stanley Livondo mobilized locals to protest against Mudavadi&rsquo;s criticism in Mumias town.Anti-riot police officers were quickly deployed within the town to prevent confrontations between Mudavadi's followers and those of Livondo and Mohammed.Read; Mudavadi: How Uhuru, Ruto duped me in 2012At one time, youth disrupted Mudavadi&rsquo;s speech as they responded with Jubilee!!!
