Residents of Laini centre in Naivasha where the deadly accident occurred killing 42 people have now differed with President Uhuru over the speed bumps along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.They have noted that the speed bumps have reduced the number of accidents on the highway adding that they would do anything possible to prevent anyone from removing them.This came as fresh details emerged that the lorry that caused the accident lost control even before it hit the bumps and ramming into the incoming vehicles and bursting into flames.On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta lambasted the Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) for erecting the speed bumps without consultations leading to the accident.But residents of Raini, Karai and Kinungi ganged up at the accident scene and noted that the accident was caused by human error and not the speed bumps.According to one of the local leaders James Kabono, since the bumps were erected last year, only two persons had died.He said that previously, they were recording up to four cases of fatal accidents involving pedestrians but the bumps had come to their rescue.&ldquo;The lorry that caused the accident lost control long before it hit the speed bumps and calls to remove them are farfetched,&rdquo; he said.Kabono who has been vocal in calling for the bumps added that more were need in Ihindu area along the same highway.&ldquo;The solution after the accident on Saturday lies in erecting speed signs on the highway and not removing the current speed bumps,&rdquo; he said.The sentiments were echoed by another area resident Samuel Karoki who said that for years tens of people had died along the highway after been hit by speeding cars.He noted since the bumps were erected, area residents could sleep in peace as the number of accidents had come down drastically.&ldquo;I was born and raised in this center and we have fought for years for these speed bumps and we shall not allow anyone to remove them,&rdquo; he said.A senior official from KENHA who declined to be named said that high powered talks were going on following the presidential directive on the bumps.He however defended the authority noting that they had erected signs along the highway but unknown people had vandalized them.&ldquo;Soon after the bumps were erected, we placed road signs along the various centers on the highway but unfortunately members of the public have vandalized them,&rdquo; he said.
