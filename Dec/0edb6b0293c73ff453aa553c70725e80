The reigning SportPesa Premier League Footballer of the Year Kenneth Muguna is now dreaming of one day playing in Europe.Muguna, who was named the league&rsquo;s best at a colourful awards gala held in Nairobi on Tuesday, said his meteoric rise this year made him feel that he could actually make that big jump to professional football abroad.The MVP, however, acknowledged the fact that he was still quite raw and inexperienced, but with a lot of room and time to improve. &ldquo;I am humbled by the recognition. I cannot say that I didn&rsquo;t expect it because all season I have been working hard and aiming to be the best footballer that I can be. I am, however, happy that other people saw my efforts and recognised them. This is very important to me.&rdquo;&ldquo;My ambition is to play in Europe. That has been my vision since I was a baby and growing up watching such great players as Drogba, Essien, Mikel, LuaLua and others. I know that it is a tall order because there are so many requirements needed to get to that stage and also because one needs to be at the very best in terms of quality, but I believe with hard work, everything is possible.&ldquo;When I joined Stima, I didn&rsquo;t know that I would be on this stage tonight, yet here I am. This shows that with good luck and the necessary effort, I can achieve my dream,&rdquo; he said on the KPL official website.On top of the coveted honour, Muguna left the awards ceremony with two 43-inch LG flat screen televisions, an LG K10 smart phone and Sh1million as prizes for winning the MVP, Midfielder of the Year, as well as the runner&rsquo; up award in the New Player of the Year category.
