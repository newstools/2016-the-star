Kenyans have been urged to be patient as the cause of the Naivasha tragedy is investigated. Forty people were killed when the driver of a canter transporting inflammable chemicals to Uganda lost control, hit 14 vehicles and exploded into a fireball, which engulfed the other vehicles.The accident took place near Kinungi trading centre, Naivasha, on Saturday night. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery clarified that the vehicle that exploded was a canter carrying inflammable chemicals to Uganda and not a fuel tanker as earlier reported.There have been conflicting reports about the cause of the accident, with the Motorists Association of Kenya attributing it to &ldquo;sign-less and crudely constructed unmarked killer bumps.&rdquo;Nkaissery said, however, there are many possibilities, including reckless driving. He said proper investigations will establish the exact cause. &ldquo;The government is helping transport bodies from Naivasha mortuary to Chiromo Mortuary. We call on Kenyans to stand with the families of those affected by this national tragedy and let the agencies give us reports,&rdquo; he said.Eleven GSU presidential guards were among those killed. They were from Bomet, where Uhuru had toured on Saturday. Transport PS Irungu Nyakera dismissed claims bumps caused the accident. He said they &ldquo;are looking at the design of the bumps&rdquo;.
