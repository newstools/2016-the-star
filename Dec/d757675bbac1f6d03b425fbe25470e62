The IEBC selection panel has unveiled the names of 35 people who re-applied for the post of the commission's chairman.Among those who have applied for the position is Florence Muoti Mwangangi - former LSK representative at the Judicial Service Commission. Professors Susan Abong&rsquo;o from Kisumu and Sussy Gumo from Trans Nzoia were the only women applicants.Others who applied included Elias Kithure from Meru, Taib Ali Taib Bajabir from Mombasa and Collins Okinyi of Migori.This comes after the team revoked the names of five candidates who sought to replace outgoing chairman Issack Hassan on grounds that they were unsuitable.Bernadette Musundi, the panel's chairperson, had in November said the five were removed following concerns raised through a memorandum by some Kenyans. She said they also relied on reports from the EACC and the Kenya Revenue Authority in making the decision to re-advertise the job. Musundi told the five not to reapply for the position when bids were called for the second time. The applicants were Margaret Shava (Kiambu), lawyer John Kangu (Kakamega), Roseline Odede (Kisumu), David Mereka (Murang'a) and David Malakwen (Nandi).They were selected from a list of 13 applicants who sought to steer the electoral commission during the 2017 general election. After the interviews, two names will be submitted to President Uhuru Kenyatta who will nominate the chairman and send the name to Parliament for vetting. Uhuru will also receive nine names from which he shall nominate six commissioners.The positions fell vacant after the commissioners agreed to resign, ending several tumultuous months of political confrontation and violent demonstrations.Read: IEBC commissioners agree to exit but want 'dignified' pay deal
