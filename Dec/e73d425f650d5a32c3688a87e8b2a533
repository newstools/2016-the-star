Twenty-sixteen ends this weekend and Kenyans enter another General Election year. What&rsquo;s more, the 2017 poll is only the second time that an incumbent President will be seeking reelection since the Daniel Moi era that ended in 2002 (his last contest as a contender having been in 1997). President Mwai Kibaki sought reelection in 2007 and that race ended in the post-election violence crisis, which took international intervention and the formation of a coalition government to even begin to resolve. What will 2017 bring? On the Opposition side the conventional wisdom is that the Jubilee Party is incapable of presiding over free, fair, transparent and credible elections, particularly in the Presidential race. And the JP side appears to be convinced that the Opposition too is capable of rigging through the expedient of disputing the Presidential poll results, plunging the country into crisis and reentering national government. These hardline positions can only cause mounting anxiety the closer to the election we get.
