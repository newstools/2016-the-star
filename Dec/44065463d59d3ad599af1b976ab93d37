Specialists in private hospitals have given the government two days to honour the 2013 CBA or they will withdraw their services.Addressing journalists at the Kenyatta National Hospital, the specialists said they are giving the government up to Thursday to fulfil the 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement. This comes 10 days after the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board chairman warned the striking health workers against disrupting services in private hospitals.Prof Emily Rogena, a pathologist at the KNH private wing, said the government has been reluctant in previous negotiations. The specialists said the government requires them to devote at least 50 per cent of their time in public service.&ldquo;We have come to this decision in a show of solidarity with our colleagues in the public sector,&rdquo; Rogena said. The union said it would not hesitate to punish those who contravene the code of ethics of medical practice. In the agreement, the doctors are awarded a 300 per cent pay rise. This means the lowest earning doctor (university trainee) will take home more than Sh300,000. Hospitals to be affected include MP Shah, Nairobi, Mater and the Aga Khan.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union secretary general Ouma Oluga said the Kenyatta private wing will also remain closed.
