Dock Workers' Union secretary general Simon Sang's announcement the unit will campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta has split it.National chairman Mohamed Sheria disputed the announcement, saying members will rally behind Cord. The deal for the union to support Jubilee was struck when Deputy President William Ruto met officials last month before the launch of the JP Coast campaign drive in Tononoka.During an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Sang said Sheria is fighting to be recognized as the union's top official but "I am the boss."He accused Sheria of using underhand tactics to discredit him.Sang said workers&rsquo; welfare will be taken care of under a JP presidency.Insiders within 6,000-member union told the Star a scheduled meeting between the union and Uhuru may not take place due to infighting. Uhuru is expected to tour all six counties during his traditional end-of-year stay at the Coast.Sheria's camp has held separate meetings to scuttle the plans to meet Uhuru. Sang said Sheria wrote to the county Labour office accusing him of mismanaging the union "to divert members' attention from campaigning for Jubilee".In a letter dated December 6, Sheria accused Sang of plotting the nomination of seven members to the National Executive Committee instead of four as required by the union's Constitution. He also alleged the union's funds are being misused to serve the interests of some members. Sang denied the allegations and said he will not be derailed."World over, unions that support the ruling party benefit immensely. In 2013, the union overwhelmingly supported the opposition, but it failed them," he said.Sheria is said to be forming a campaign team for Cord. Sang said politicking in Mombasa and Kilifi to dethrone incumbent governors is intense. He said workers will vote for Jubilee because many issues, including pay, have been resolved.Sang also said they resolved to back Uhuru because his administration agreed to reinstate union officials dismissed for leading a strike last year to protest against NHIF rates.
