Former Mombasa mayor Taib Ali has said his first priority would be to clean up the voter register if appointed the new IEBC chairperson.While appearing before the selection panel, Taib on Monday stated that he applied for the job to protect the country and his family. "There is no room to move outside the law and that is what I hope to achieve if elected the chairperson because with that we protect the country as well as individual families," he said.He further said he will ensure that there is no acrimony between the political parties and the electoral agency."It is important that we learn from the 2013 general elections where the electoral body does not hoard information to any stakeholder," he said.Read: Selection panel shortllists five candidates for IEBC chairTaib said there will be no need to run different tallying systems from IEBC if the commission is empowered and uphold transparency during polls."People run parallel tallying systems because they do not have confidence in the commission, so if we ensure the electoral body is well empowered and strengthened then we would not have the need for such a parallel body by either side of the political parties," Taib said.Also read: Eyes on selection panel as interviews for IEBC chair start on MondayHe said he will only fall back to manual systems should the digital voter systems fail during the election."We will only fall back to paper trail with every party's involvement and this will only be if need be during the vote count," he said.The lawyer also said he will also invest in staff equipped with the right information and capability to deal with any disputes that will come up after the 2017 elections.Taib was the first of the ten nominees to appear before the panel at the County Hall in Nairobi after being shortlisted by IEBC selection panel for the job. The job attracted more than 45 applications occasioned by the resignation of the team that steered the 2013 poll.
