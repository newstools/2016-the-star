The IEBC is not keen on conducting party primaries, even though the law allows for it.IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba on Friday said, &ldquo;There is the issue of whether it would be prudent for the commission to run party primaries as well as conduct the elections. There are also gaps with respect to funding that must be addressed.&rdquo;The commission is mandated to regulate the manner in which parties nominate their candidates.Chiloba said both party primaries and the registration of candidates can occur on the same date.The law requires the commission to gazette candidates and the dates primaries will be held by May 27. Within 14 days - June 9 &ndash; parties should have conducted their primaries and are required to present their papers to the commission.The Jubilee Party has already announced it will approach the IEBC to conduct its primaries in a bid to make them free and fair.Opposition parties have opposed this arrangement, despite being involved in the enactment of its provision in Parliament.Chiloba announced that audit firm KPMG started analysing the voters register yesterday and will complete the process on January 18 next year.He said the audit report will be submitted to Parliament on February 1.Chiloba said the audit is a requirement of the new electoral laws, although the methodology to be used is not defined.KPMG is to use best practice to clean up the register.The Expression of Interest advert for audit firms attracted 11 firms and six were asked to submit proposals.Four firms submitted technical and financial proposals to the IEBC, and two met requirements.The IEBC is required to implement the recommendations of the audit report by February 17, just two days after the end of the next mass voter registration exercise.Mass voter registration is scheduled to start on January 16, and on February 1 for people in the diaspora.The exercise will end on February 15.&ldquo;We target to register six million additional voters before the 2017 election. This will need support and goodwill from all Kenyans,&rdquo; Chiloba said. Cord leader Raila Odinga has warned Jubilee government against any attempts to use the IEBC to rig the election.He urged Jubilee to respect the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee formed in June to chart the path for IEBC reforms. Raila said the law negotiated to usher in a new electoral commission is irreversible.
