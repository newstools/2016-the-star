Thousands of refugees fleeing a severe drought in Somali might start arriving in Kenya early next year, aid agencies have warned. Already, there are reports of large movements of people across the country, including the regions close to Kenya. &ldquo;Aid agencies, the UNHCR and governments in the Horn of Africa have raised the red flag concerning the drought condition, which has been a slow-onset disaster throughout 2016. Action must be taken now. People&rsquo;s lives are at risk,&rdquo; Norwegian Refugee Council in the Horn of Africa acting regional director Abdirahman Jama has warned. At least 15 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya face imminent drought and famine with water scarcity, food shortages and increasing loss of livestock, the United Nations says. The situation is likely to match the 2011 crisis, in which thousands of dying Somali refugees arrived in Daadab every week. Many of them died along the way.In Kenya, the National Drought Management Authority says 1.3 million people are affected by the drought. This is because the March-May long rains were low, while the October-December short rains did not reach most areas. Next year&rsquo;s long rains are also likely to be poor. The NDMA says poor families in parts of Laisamis in Marsabit, Tana North in Tana River, Fafi, Balambala and Dadaab in Garissa county - where refugees and vulnerable host communities live, are the worst hit. The authority has issued drought early warnings covering these regions. Classified as &ldquo;alarming&rdquo;, the Garissa county early warning report indicates increasing food scarcity in Dadaab and Balambala subcounties. &ldquo;The normal water sources are drying off and there are reports of dying animals in Samburu ward. Poor rains and prolonged drought are the problem,&rdquo; NDMA Kwale coordinator Roman Shera recently said.
