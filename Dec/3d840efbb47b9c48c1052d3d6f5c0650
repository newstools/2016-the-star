Almost half of matatus in Nairobi are not paying parking fees effectively, denying the county nearly Sh2 billion in revenue every year.County deputy head of revenue Shaban Asman said this was revealed by the electronic parking system introduced last year.&ldquo;Figures from the National Transport and Safety Authority show there are 444 saccos in Nairobi with 29,000 vehicles. But our system shows only 16,000 are paying for parking,&rdquo; he said.Matatus pay for drop off and pick up points monthly (seasonal tickets). The fee ranges from Sh3,000 to Sh7,500, depending on the capacity of the vehicle.&ldquo;We are going to tighten and enhance enforcement in the coming year to ensure 100 per cent compliance,&rdquo; Asman said.In the last financial year, the county collected Sh2 billion from parking. There are about 12,000 parking slots in the city and 2,000 of them are reserved for public and private institutions.The remaining 10,000 are open to daily and seasonal parking. The county charges Sh200,000 per year per reserved slot and Sh300 per slot for daily parking.&ldquo;Government institutions have more than 400 slots with arrears of more than Sh400 million. We have tried to engage them but they are not responding,&rdquo; Asman said.He said all those with reserved parking spaces have until tomorrow to renew them or they will have to apply for them afresh next year.&ldquo;If they fail to renew them, then we shall declare them vacant and invite interested people to apply. This will be based on first come, first served basis because of the high demand,&rdquo; Asman said.He also raised concern over the slow pace at which businesspeople are renewing their licences.&ldquo;Members of the public are not responding the way they are supposed to. We are seeing a very low turnout. Renewal starts in September but this year it has been too slow,&rdquo; Asman said.He said the county will next year embark on a massive 'clampdown' of, especially billboards that have not been paid for and premises with rates arrears.
