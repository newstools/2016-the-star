Investigations into the Naivasha tanker explosion began on Tuesday with DCI detectives collecting samples from bodies at Chiromo mortuary.The probe is aimed at clearing doubts surrounding the deaths of 43 people in the fire that consumed their vehicles.Nathaniel Kigotho, National Disaster Operation Centre director, said government pathologists, led by their chief Johansen Oduor, have taken samples from families of 28 victims.He said they will also collect samples from all the 33 bodies that have been taken to the mortuary since Sunday.One body was taken to the Kenyatta University funeral home and another buried on Sunday.Families are required to assist in the identification through physical marks where necessary.But Kigotho said all the bodies must be subjected to DNA tests to ensure they are handed to the correct families.He said a body has been claimed by more than one family, hence the need to conduct the identification with utmost precision."We are taking samples from closest relatives... mothers, brothers or sisters. We hope the exercise will progress well," he said."We don&rsquo;t want a repeat of what happened in the past where a body was exhumed after it emerged that it was buried by the wrong family."The deaths occurred after a lorry ferrying flammable substances to Uganda rammed into another vehicles at Karai, exploded and razed 14 cars.The toll rose to 43 after three more people died at hospitals in Nairobi.Kigotho said a survivor who was taken to Kenyatta National Hospital was responding well to treatment.Read: Motorists blame Naivasha tragedy on irregularly erected bumpsAlso read: Uhuru blames Kenha for death of 40 in Naivasha accident
