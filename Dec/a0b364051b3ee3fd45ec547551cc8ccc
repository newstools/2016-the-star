New HIV-Aids infections among the youth and adolescents in Kisumu county have increased to 4,996. This is despite a drop in the number of new infections by around 1,600. Governor Jack Ranguma said the county must arrest annual new infections among adolescents and the youth, who comprise 40 per cent of the county&rsquo;s population. In a speech read on his behalf by Health chief officer Lusi Ojwang, he said there is growing evidence that this group is particularly vulnerable to HIV-Aids.&ldquo;We are therefore faced with a formidable challenge of providing our youths with opportunities for a safe, healthy and economically productive future,&rdquo; Ranguma said. He said the Health department has continued to work with all partners to ensure HIV prevention and treatment programmes targeting the youth are in place.Health director Dickens Onyango said the number of new infections has gone down. &ldquo;In 2013, the county had 10,349 new infections, which dropped to 8,790 in 2015,&rdquo; he said on Friday in Kisumu. Onyango said on viral suppressions, the county is at 62 per cent for adults and 52 per cent for children.
