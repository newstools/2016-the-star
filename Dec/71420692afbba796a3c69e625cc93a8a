More than 3,490 farmers in Migori county have received 300 dairy cows and 49 Sahiwal bulls to increase food production and their incomes. In 2014 the county government set up a Sh17 million dairy cow project to increase milk yield. In the 2014-15 financial year the county gave out 150 dairy cows and another 150 in 2015-16 with 49 bulls.The farmers have been divided into groups of 10, which get a cow each. Governor Okoth Obado said each cow can produce more than 20 litres per day. He spoke during an interview with the Star on Wednesday.Obado said the project has benefited poor farmers. &ldquo;My government has formed four clusters in every ward and every cluster is given one animal. This translates to four animals per ward. In seven subcounties it gives a total of 150 cows in the county,&rdquo; Obado said.Gilbert Ombok, 51, from Oruba-Ragana ward, Suna West subcounty, earns a living by selling milk. &ldquo;I am able to get 18 to 20 litres of milk. I have bought another cow from the savings,&rdquo; he said.Obado said the county has bought and distributed 15 milk cooling and processing plants to milk producing areas.For effective implementation the county has provided motorcycles to livestock extension officers to provide medical services and technical advice to farmers.Obado said the county provides artificial insemination services to improve cattle breeds. More than 1,047 animals have been inseminated. Migori has 343,030 cows, out of which only 11,430 are grade cows, according to the 2009 national population census.The governor said despite the huge animal population, Migori still faces a milk deficit of 38.8 million litres. &ldquo;We also plan to buy 50 Zebu bulls to be distributed to farmers to improve indigenous stock and increase milk production,&rdquo; Obado said.Obado said improving food security is vital to his administration. He said his county has spent Sh31 million to give subsidised farm input to poor farmers.The county also spent Sh20 million on tissue culture banana project that involved more than 2,500 farmers, he said.
