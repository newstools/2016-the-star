PNU has sued the Registrar of Political Parties for failing to gazette Meru Governor Peter Munya as its new leader. In an urgent application filed at the High Court yesterday, the party accused Registrar Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u of refusing to gazette Munya alongside new officials, despite being given a new list of names.The party told the court that Ndung&rsquo;u was served with the list on November 2, and was required by law to publish it within 14 days, but she has not done so.&ldquo;Despite the mandatory provisions of the law, the respondent herein has capriciously and without any law refused, declined and neglected to gazette the party changes as duly notified by PNU, despite lacking the requisite powers to reject the said changes,&rdquo; PNU stated in a suit filed by lawyer Okong&rsquo;o Omogeni.PNU delegates endorsed Munya in October to succeed retired President Mwai Kibaki. The party agreed to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s reelection in 2017, even though it refused to dissolve and join his Jubilee Party. The party&rsquo;s National Delegates Conference resolved to field candidates for all elective posts next year, except the presidency.During the NDC, delegates elected John Anunda as secretary general, Paul Rukaria as deputy secretary general, David Kamau first vice chairman and Sheikh Juma Ngao as second vice chairman. Anunda said parties are supposed to submit their nominations rules and membership list to the IEBC by January 13 for them to be legible to field candidates in the election.
