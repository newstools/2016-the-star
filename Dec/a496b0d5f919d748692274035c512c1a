Property worth millions of shillings went up in flames after a fierce fire gutted a mattress factory in Thika town.However, no one was injured in the Saturday night incident at the Jungle Nut Foam Factory, which is part of Jungle Group Holdings owned by MP hopeful Patrick Wainaina.The fire, whose cause is yet to be established, destroyed equipment, godowns, raw materials and other property, before it was put out by county firefighters.Head of human resources and administration Joseph Murigi said about 500 employees risk losing their jobs, as a result of the forthcoming closure of the plant.He said the fire was reported at 11pm, when security personnel manning the gates noticed huge flames.&ldquo;They alerted us and we immediately called the fire brigade, who assisted us in putting out the flames,&rdquo; Murigi said.&ldquo;Luckily, there were no workers inside the factory at the time because the night shift had been cancelled ahead of the Jamhuri Day celebrations.&rdquo;He said the situation would have been worse if county firefighters and neighbours had not responded swiftly. Murigi said police are investigating. He urged workers to remain calm.Employee Dominic Macharia expressed fears over his future, saying the fire destroyed his only source of livelihood.&ldquo;We are heading for the Christmas festivities. In January, we will be expected to raise money for our children&rsquo;s school fees. We pray operations will be restored quickly,&rdquo; he said.CEO Wainaina said they will make efforts to resume production soon.&ldquo;We will be back soon. We will keep creating jobs even when the devil wants to destroy them,&rdquo; he said.Jungle Holdings, which also makes concrete poles and processes fruit juice and macadamia nuts, has 2,500 employees.
