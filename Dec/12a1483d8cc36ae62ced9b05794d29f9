City Hall has disowned a newspaper advertisement that it signed off showing that a developer wanted to turn a piece of land on Mbagathi Way from a cemetery to residential apartments.Instead, the county government says that the land is a public property whose ownership had changed illegally.The ad, stated that the owner wanted to change its use from a cemetery to residential multi-dwellings (apartments) subject to approval of the county.The ad, which circulated on social media last Thursday was signed off by the county secretary.&ldquo;We are not the originator of this ad. It is not from us,&rdquo; Lands executive Christopher Khaemba said.&ldquo;The information that we have as at now is that the land was a public property but was allocated to a private developer by the councilors in the 90s,&rdquo; he said.Khaemba said that the plot (LR no 209/6505/2) off Mbagathi Way, was set aside for cemetery among other plots in the area, but had been grabbed over years.&ldquo;A cemetery cannot be converted to another use. We are short of land to bury our people. We have agreed with the governor that he land must remain as cemetery land though I am told it was allocated to some private developer,&rdquo; he says.Khaemba said, if the developer was genuine, then he should have erected a sign board on the site indicating the intended change of use.He said that the land was county land and therefore public land set aside for the purpose of a cemetery.&ldquo;I have asked for details of who allocated it and to which developer and when the same was done,&rdquo; he said.He said the county has already notified the National Land Commission to revoke the developer's ownership documents and revert back the land to public use.Health executive Bernard Muia said the land cannot be turned into building of apartments. "Not only is it anti-social, it is unheard of to disturb the spirits of those who are resting in peace.," he said.
