Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has said his refusal to sponsor ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s visits to the county could be the reason he was expelled from theparty.&ldquo;I have never sponsored anyone and I cannot do that because our budgets are clear and specific, so money cannot be diverted,&rdquo; he said.Mvurya said the Kwale government respects the law. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that is the reason I was expelled because the governing council made a lot of effortto remove me from ODM,&rdquo; he said. Jubilee MPs last week said Cord governors have been giving Raila monthly stipends and sponsoring his trips abroad and across the country. They accused Raila of double standards in fighting corruption. The MPs said he criticises the government, while protecting Cord governors implicated in looting taxpayer money.Auditor General Edward Ouko has released reports on massive corruption and unaccounted for spending in county governments.Mvurya urged the opposition not to politicise the war on corruption and instead allow the anti-graft agency to do its work.&ldquo;Audit is done in all the 47 counties and the national government as well, irrespective of political affiliations,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The problem is that audit information has been used politically, even by senators who have grudges with governors. Most times they summon them for questioning.&rdquo;
