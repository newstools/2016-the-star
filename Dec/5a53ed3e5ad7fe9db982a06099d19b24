Police on Thursday recovered four rocket propelled grenade shells and 111 rounds of ammunition buried in the ground at Mbuzi Wengi in Mtwapa.Twenty-six of the ammunition were spent, while 85 were still live.Kilifi county commissioner Joseph Keter told the press that a resident recovered the cache of weapons at a heap of garbage."The person was coming from Maweni towards Mtwapa and he lit a cigarette and threw the matchstick on the ground. There was some garbage that caught fire and suddenly he heard several popping sounds from the burning heap," Keter said."He notified the OCS Mtwapa Police Station, who visited the scene and discovered several bullets that had been hidden in the ground," Keter added.Area police boss Wachira Mathenge said the weapons must have been hidden many years ago and do not pose any danger."The grenades have no powder and their pins have been removed. It could be they were already used or were destroyed by nature through the many years they have been under the ground," he said."We suspect they were hidden in the 1960s. The average lifespan of a bullet is only 15 years,&rdquo; he said.But he said the cache will be sent to Nairobi for ballistic assessment to ascertain how long they have been hidden there.The 7.65 mm bullets are used for the Tockaliv pistol, which is not used by any force in the country but is mostly used by criminals.In 2014, a Tockaliv pistol was found hidden in a bush at Tezo village, while early this year, an Mpesa robber was gunned down and another Tockaliv was recovered.Keter said security in the county has been heightened with sniffer dogs being used in patrols.&ldquo;We have not arrested anyone so far but we are closely following up the matter for any suspects&rdquo; he added.This comes at a time when the security team is investigating the sprouting of criminal gangs in the area who were operating from Mombasa.
