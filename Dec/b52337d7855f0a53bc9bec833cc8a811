Former Naivasha MP John Mututho has selected a 26-year-old secondary school teacher as his running mate for the Nakuru governorship.His choice of Maurine Chebet has drawn wide responses from locals who perceive it as the beginning of an exciting leadership.Residents of Kaptembwa, Mauche, Kuresoi and Rongai in Nakuru county have welcomed his decision, noting that Chebet will be the youngest female leader in the county leadership."Mututho has made history by settling on a young woman from Kapkores in Kuresoi South. This is an indication that he values the needy people of Kuresoi," John Mungai said.Janet Chumo, a woman leader from Kuresoi, said Mututho's choice shows that he is keen on both youth and gender issues. She pledged her support for the two in the 2017 general elections."Nakuru county has several resources but due to bad leadership, has been one of the underdeveloped counties. To redeem it, Mututho has proved that he is the only saviour," she added.Robert Too, a resident of Kuresoi South, said out of Sh44 billion that the current Governor Kinuthia Mbugua has received as devolved funds, the only project they brought to the region is a morgue at Olenguruone District Hospital.Too added that Mbugua&rsquo;s system is slow and unfit for the current generation. He said both the Governor and deputy Governor Joseph Rutto are retirees who disregard gender and youth.Chebet, who has been embraced by the Kalenjin community, has pledged to represent the underprivileged across the county.She said she would traverse the county swiftly to note the problems of residents."Coming from a poor family, I know problems that people face and I promise to be their only savior. We are will not be rulers but people&rsquo;s servants" she said.Mututho, while speaking to Mauche residents in Njoro constituency on Friday, asked locals to register as voters saying the only way to redeem Nakuru from bad leadership is by casting a vote against the incumbent Governor.Read: Governor Mbugua blasts Mututho, says Nacada boss has failedAlso read: Mututho bid criticised
