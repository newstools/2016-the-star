Six teams have been disqualified from the Kenya Cup II and the Nationwide League after failing to honour three consecutive matches.According to the 2016-2017 league committee: &ldquo;All rules with respect to disqualification of a team from a competition as per the 2016-2017 League manuals have been taken into consideration and effected in the standings.&rdquo;&ldquo;If a club is expelled or suspended from a league or from membership of the constitution, the results of all matches played shall be deleted for all purposes and the final league table positions shall be established from all matches played between the remaining clubs in the league&rdquo;Former Kenya Cup side Bungoma Sharks and KeMu Meru were disqualified from the Kenya Cup II while MKU Kakamega, Kakamega RFC, Brumbies and KeMU Nairobi were axed from the Nationwide league. The clubs missed their fixtures after failing to raise teams or due to lack of funds to facilitate their travel and accommodation expenses. KeMU Meru missed championship matches against Thika RFC, South Coast Pirates and Mombasa RFC while Bungoma Sharks missed fixtures against USIU, Moi University, Kisii RFC and Kisumu. MKU Kakamega missed matches against Kakamega Welfare, Bungoma and Shieywe while Kakamega did not turn up against Masinde Muliro University, Webuye, Kakamega Welfare and Bungoma.Meanwhile, Nondescripts RFC will hold a touch rugby tournament in honour of their departed centre Ogeto Gecheo today at 2pm. The match will be open to all the rugby clubs, players and fans and will also be used to raise funds to help offset the burial expenses. Just like the late Kenya Lionesses Captain Aberdeen Shikoyi, Ogeto succumbed to an injury he picked when his club was playing against Strathmore Leos during the Kenya Cup round five. A minute of silence will be observed before kick-off across all league matches tomorrow.
