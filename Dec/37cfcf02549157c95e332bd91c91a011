Only one patient is still at the Bungoma Referral Hospital after everyone left following the doctors&rsquo; strike that entered its third day yesterday. Stella Nyabolo, 81, has been at the facility since 1971. She has nowhere to go.She is alone at the hospital as other patients have been taken to private hospitals.Nyabolo, the oldest patient at the hospital, was brought to the hospital in July 1971 alongside other patients who were treated and discharged. She was admitted with severe injuries received after the war broke out in Uganda when President Idi Amin overthrew Milton Obote&rsquo;s government.Health worker Timothy Wamocho said more than 40 patients have been discharged and only Nyabolo remains.Wamocho said she will be taken care of since the hospital has been her home for 46 years.Nyabolo is still traumatised, and does not like being taken care of by men caregivers. Nyabolo has learned a bit of Bukusu, the local language, for the 46 years she has been at the facility.Wamocho said Nyabolo has no relatives in Kenya and is also mentally incapacitated. As the facility remains deserted, residents ask who will take care of the newly acquired expensive machines as only the guards are at the hospital.The county government, in partnership with the national government, this year spent close to Sh400 million on X-ray and dialysis machines, among other equipment.A spot check by the Star showed the majority of the patients flocked to Bungoma West and Lumboka private hospitals for medical attention.Most complained of the high cost and charges, pleading with the government to end the stalemate and meet the medics&rsquo; demands. Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka said the Health department has contracted 39 doctors to ease the crisis.
