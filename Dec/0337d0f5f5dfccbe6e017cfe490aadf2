Construction of the new Kakamega assembly chambers will be moved from disputed land, clerk Patrick Kamwesser has said.The assembly service board early this year started the construction but private developer Panachand Shah claimed the piece of land belongs to him. He moved to court and obtained orders stopping the works.The Controller of Budget halted funding for the project, worth Sh500 million, after the court case.&ldquo;We have decided to build the new chambers in available space at the current assembly chambers. We&rsquo;re only waiting for a consultant to finalise his report before we write to the budget controller to release money for the project,&rdquo; Kamwesser said.The move is likely to spark uproar among MCAs since Sh100 million set aside for the project in 2015-16 has been spent on the works at the disputed site. The MCAs on November 30 voted to revert the Sh100 million in the current budget earmarked for the new chambers to the executive in the county&rsquo;s 2016-17 supplementary budget estimates.South Marama MCA Willis Opuka said the assembly development budget is being shifted to the executive &ldquo;because the money could be misused&rdquo;.&ldquo;There will be nobody to oversee and supervise the works,&rdquo; he said. The assembly adjourned for the Christmas recess on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Kakamega MCAs failed to conclude session business last Thursday before adjourning for the Christmas holidays.The MCAs were trying to beat the IEBC deadline on submission of campaign accounts details and campaign managers.The assembly will hold a special sitting today to pass the Kakamega County General Teaching and Referral Hospital Bill 2016 before adjourning.
