Education CS Fred Matiang'i and senior education officers will supervise the opening of schools on January 4 and 9 for continuing students and form ones, respectively.He said he will catch up with secondary school principals who charge higher fees out of what has been gazetted by the government.In 2015, the government gazetted day school fees at Sh9,374, boarding fees at Sh53,543 and special education schools Sh37,210 per year.Matiang'i said school fees should be appropriately spread throughout the year in the ratio of 50-30-20 for first, second and third terms, respectively.&ldquo;These fees guidelines must be implemented without exception,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is primitive and illegal to charge outside the guidelines.&rdquo;Principals charging extra fees will be punished, the CS added.Matiang'i directed all regional coordinators and county directors of Education to ensure that fees guidelines are strictly adhered to.Sanctions will be implemented, including barring any defaulting principal from being a signatory to school accounts, he said.Matiang'i told parents to pay the exact amount of fees provided for in the Gazette Notice, and report any cases of additional charges to regional education coordinators and county directors of education.He urged schools to make formal requests if they have any expenditures which require urgent completion.
