Gatundu North MP Kigo Njenga has asked Auditor General Edward Ouko to resign, saying he is incompetent and lacks objectivity.Fuming over revelations in an audit report that showed his constituency could not account for Sh72 million CDF money, Njenga told off Ouko saying he "could easily burn this country with inaccurate and malicious reports.""I am a professional accountant and I can tell you that the reports are inconclusive and aimed at perpetuating a certain narrative," he said."He should resign and give that job to another competent Kenyan who can conduct professional and objective audits, not these hoaxes."The MP told a press conference at Parliament Buildings that auditors were given bank statements from KCB, confirming that the amount in question was available.Njenga said he did not understand why this was not captured in Ouko's report."The Auditor General was (immediately) supplied with the necessary documents. It is upon him to tell Kenyans why he did not update his report," he said.Njenga further asked the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya to intervene urgently and reign in the "rampaging" Ouko, so he carry outy his duties professionally."As the regulator of the industry, ICPAK must intervene on this matter because Kenyans are being misled," he said.Read: Gatundu North locals fault poor use of CDF money
