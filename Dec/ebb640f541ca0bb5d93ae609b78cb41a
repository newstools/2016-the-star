Nyandarua residents have termed the Christmas tree lit by Governor Daniel Waithaka in Ol kalou town on Monday "a public disgrace and wastage of public resources".Governor director of communications Eliud Miring'u on Tuesday said the tree cost Sh10,000 and not Sh2 million as reported on a social media platform.&ldquo;Those spreading propaganda about Sh2 million are malicious,&rdquo; he wrote on Nyandarua Media Forum WhatsApp Group. &ldquo;You know it cannot happen and this tree does not carry value beyond Sh10,000. But there are those among us who will grab any opportunity available to hurl needless insults.&rdquo;The tree, which is about five metres tall and one- and- a-half-foot wide, was lit outside the assistant county commissioner's office.Initially, the office of the governor had decorated a cider tree at the gate of the county assembly offices and had done the wiring in readiness to fix the bulbs. But the governor is said to have been advised against the idea by one of his officers, hence the reason for buying the Christmas tree.Blogger Chege Thiari on Tuesday started the debate after posting on the Nyandarua People&rsquo;s Assembly Facebook page about the tree. He said the Christmas tree was worth Sh2 million.&ldquo;I'm sure that Governor Waithaka and his handlers will even send Nyandarua Valentine flowers come February 2017,&rdquo; he wrote.&ldquo;Nyandarua imerogwa ama ni nini? (Has Nyandarua been bewitched?),&rdquo; a journalist practicing in Nyandarua posed o the Nyandarua Media Forum WhatsApp group.The debate across all social media platforms caught the Nyandarua government officials napping.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday evening, Miring&rsquo;u said initially he thought the issue of Sh2million was a joke being propagated on social media. &ldquo;But they have taken the joke too far,&rdquo; he saidMiring'u said the idea of a Christmas tree was for the office of the governor to raise Sh100,000 to buy gifts for the elderly and the disadvantaged. "All the records are available concerning the figures spent for any interested person to see. And can also be confirmed from Nakuru where the tree was purchased," he said.Miring&rsquo;u said some political brokers will "twist" the intent of the good gesture to suit their selfish interests, given this is campaigning period.
