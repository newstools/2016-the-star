Governor Mwangi Wairia's bulk messaging service code has been suspended for allegedly using it to send his rival Jamleck Kamau insulting messages.Kamau, Kigumo MP, is vying for governor against Wairia.Service provider Safaricom acted following complaints received on December 9 through the Communications Authority of Kenya.Residents said they were receiving unsolicited and abusive political messages targeting Wairia&rsquo;s opponents.In a letter to CAK signed by Safaricom director of corporate affairs Stephen Chege, Safaricom said the messages complained about had not been verified by the company or the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. Safaricom said the service, under an alphanumeric code &ldquo;Wa-Iria&rdquo; and managed by Discovery Product Ltd acted against the CAK guidelines.The guideline states that &ldquo;prior to sending a political message, Discovery Product Ltd was expected to make a request to Safaricom as a mobile network operator at least 48 hours before sending the message.Safaricom was then expected to vet its content to ensure compliance with these guidelines before the message was dispatched."We note that the transmission herein by the CSP was not in accordance with the Authority's guidelines for the prevention of transmission of undesirable bulk political content/messages via electronic communications networks," Safaricom said in its letter."In this regards, we wish to confirm to the Authority that we have put in place a procedure for vetting of political messages in line with the guidelines and continuously communicate the same to content service providers, requiring their compliance. We have therefore suspended the short code herein for non-compliance with the guidelines."Wairia and Kamau's supporters have clashed in recent months.
