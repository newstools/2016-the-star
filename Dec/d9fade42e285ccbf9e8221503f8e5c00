Three days after President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s tour of Western, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has accused the Jubilee government of giving the county a raw deal. Addressing the press at his office on Monday, the governor said there is no meaningful project that residents can give the Jubilee administration credit for. &ldquo;The only project that the national government has brought to this county and it is through the World Bank is the One-Stop Border Post,&rdquo; Ojaamong said.&ldquo;The OSBP is good for the East African Community member states but not the community on the border. It has been relegated to the periphery, with the trucks plying the Northern Corridor stopping on the Ugandan side of the border.&rdquo; Governor Ojaamong said this has left thousands of Kenyan clearing agents jobless.
