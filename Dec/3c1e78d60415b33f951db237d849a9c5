Members of the 11th Parliament need to rise to the occasion today when they meet to finish the Special Sitting that ended in bedlam on Tuesday night.In the midst of a chaotic situation, Speaker Justin Muturi cut the live video feed with a flick of a switch.The MPs need to provide leadership and abjure anarchy. What example are they setting for their keen supporters and followers when they brawl on the floor of the House or use pepper spray in a crowded space?The House needs to discuss the issues of national importance it was recalled from recess to deliberate on with sobriety. There has been filibustering in many parliaments in the Commonwealth, but Tuesday&rsquo;s Day of Shame in the Chamber has few precedents in modern times.As for Speaker Muturi&rsquo;s cutting off the video feed, he was switching off democracy surely.Whatever happens today, the Speaker should appreciate sunshine is the best disinfectant and allow the feed to stay on.
