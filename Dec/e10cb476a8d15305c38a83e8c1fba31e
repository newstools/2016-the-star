After missing in action for one year due to injury, marathoner Margaret Agai is back and ready to rumble.The athlete who comes from West Pokot County but trains at the 2 Running Club in Kapsabet competed at the Lisbon Half Marathon and Shanghai marathon this year.&ldquo;I am very happy that I have recovered after suffering an injury for the last year. I competed in Lisbon in October and Shanghai and I felt my form was returning,&rdquo; Agai said.She finished fourth at the Kalya Half Marathon in Makutano last month.This year she set her season&rsquo;s best of 2:26.28 in Shanghai and half marathon in 1:10.28 in Lisbon.&ldquo;Running that impressive time was not easy. I had to train hard after being off season. That is the achievement this year and I am planning more,&rdquo; Agai who has a 2:23.28 personal best time said.Though she started competing late this season, she feels it has been good and the few achievements for the season are motivating factors for the coming season.&ldquo;My focus is to hit the road running next year and we have to plan with my manager. It will be a World Championships season and I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind but I am preparing,&rdquo; she said.
