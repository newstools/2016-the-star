AFC Leopards Secretary General Oscar Igaida said they are keen on maintaining Jackson Saleh in the team, but the ultimate decisions rested with club coach Stewart Hall. Saleh originally left Leopards in January 2016 and made the shock move to join bitter foes K&rsquo;Ogalo, much to the chagrin of Ingwe fans&ldquo;We still have about 20 days or so for us to make our decision, but I don&rsquo;t think the management has a problem with him. We will just wait for the coach&rsquo;s word. He has the exclusive mandate to determine who stays and who leaves the club,&rdquo; Igaida said on the leagues official portal.The on loan defender is in a dilemma of sorts concerning his immediate football future.The Gor Mahia player&rsquo;s six-month loan deal with Ingwe lapses at the end of December, meaning that he is destined to return to his mother employer.The challenge however, is that play time at K&rsquo;Ogalo proved almost impossible for the 27-year old, with Brazilian coach Marcelo Ferreira preferring to work with the quartet of Eric Ouma, Karim Nizigiyimana, Harun Shakava, and captain Musa Mohammed, with Burundian Abouba Sibomana standing by as an emergency replacement at the back.It is, in fact, because of this situation that Saleh was loaned to rivals Leopards.The fact that Ze Maria, is working round the clock to ensure the contracts of Sibomana and Ouma are extended before the end of the year is a clear indication that Saleh would be considered surplus to requirement at Gor.In another development, Ulinzi Stars FC head coach Robert Matano says the Soldiers have to improve their game in order to be competitive in the Caf Confederations Cup.The soldiers qualified for the tournament after winners Tusker FC qualified for the Caf Champions League following their triumph in the SportPesa Premier League. Matano, who has reported to camp after a three month sick leave, says early preparations are vital for the team to succeed.&ldquo;I am happy to be back in this team and to do what I love doing, that is coaching these players. We have a vital assignment ahead, a challenging one and we have to show our seriousness by getting prepared early. We are going to face the continent&rsquo;s best sides.&rdquo;The soldiers, under caretaker coach Benjamin Nyangweso, finished third in the league with 46 points.&ndash;additional report by Goal.com
