The Kenya Railways Corporation has said the official route of the Nairobi-Naivasha SGR extension has not yet been determined.The corporation assured that it is working on the last details of the route, which has drawn opposition from activists and environmentalists opposed to the railway passing through the Nairobi National Park.KRC managing director Atanas Maina said some traders are seeking to buy land on the &ldquo;purported route&rdquo;, hoping the government would later buy it at exaggerated prices.He urged Kenyans to be wary of such individuals, saying they are placing beacons before engineers from the company start drawing up the route. &ldquo;No one knows where the route of the second phase of this project is. Once the design is done, we will make it public,&rdquo; Maina said.He spoke during a meeting with residents of Kajiado, Kiambu, Narok and Nakuru counties in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, on Saturday.Maina said just as they did in the first phase, residents who will border the railway line will benefit from projects as part of the company&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility.&ldquo;We will build schools and dispensaries for communities affected by this project,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The company will also arrange a tour for the communities here in areas where we have done such projects during construction of the first phase.&rdquo;During the meeting, local leader Ruth Nairosua said herbs that the community use would be destroyed by the project.&ldquo;We have for ages relied on the herbs for treating people and other purposes. KRC should ensure they are not interfered with,&rdquo; she said. Elizabeth Wanjiru from Nkoroi Welfare Association, Kajiado, said they are being kept in the dark over the project by the company. &ldquo;We have invested heavily in areas where we live and because some houses will be demolished, we need to be told what will be the process of compensation,&rdquo; she said.
