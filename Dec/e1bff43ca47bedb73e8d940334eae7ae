Five hopefuls have joined in the race for the Baringo Senate seat. Most of them are seeking the Jubilee Party ticket to fight it out with Senator Gideon Moi. Rift Valley Water Services Board director Christine Ndoigo is the latest entrant to declare her interest. She said she will advocate for more resources to be allocated to Baringo county. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m passionate about representing and defending the interests of the people of Baringo,&rdquo; Ndoigo said on Sunday. Others in the race are Baringo Livestock chief officer Gideon Toromo, Samuel Cheraisi, Kaptuiya Cheboiwo and Ayabei Kennedy. There were reports that Jubilee was grooming former East African and Regional Cooperation minister Musa Sirma to take on Gideon. But two weeks ago, Sirma said he would run for his former parliamentary seat in Eldama Ravine.
