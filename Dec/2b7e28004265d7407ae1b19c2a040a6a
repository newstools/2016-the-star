The organization chairlady Atieno Otieno said people needed to get in touch with Conje to give her moral support adding that they will not relent as an organization to assist the boxer and her family. Otieno said Conje has been sick for around six years and appreciated many people who have come out help her.&ldquo;Me and my friends from the legal profession and the organization are working with her and the son to ensure that she has people that will help her get through this time in her life, &ldquo;she said.
