Former women s boxing sensation Conjestina Achieng has been discharged from a psychiatric ward at Kisumu county hospital after one month of admission.Speaking after her release from the hospital this week courtesy of Maendeleo Ya Wanawake organization, Achieng thanked the organization for coming to her aid.She complained of neglect after people who visited her failed to keep their promises to aid her. People only come to see me; they don t tell me any developments or things that will help me as others fail to keep their promises, she said.Conjestina, who is fondly known as Hands of Stone by her fans, says she has not received any financial support to help her cope with her condition. The organization chairlady Atieno Otieno said people needed to get in touch with Conje to give her moral support adding that they will not relent as an organization to assist the boxer and her family. Otieno said Conje has been sick for around six years and appreciated many people who have come out help her. Me and my friends from the legal profession and the organization are working with her and the son to ensure that she has people that will help her get through this time in her life, she said.
