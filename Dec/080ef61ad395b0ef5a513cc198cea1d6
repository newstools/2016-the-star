Breathalysers will soon be introduced outside bars, clubs and other alcohol outlets in Nairobi to curb drink driving. The city county has partnered with the National Transport and Safety Authority to station officers at the joints to test people's alcohol levels.&ldquo;Once you are done with drinking and you have a car, you will be tested at the entrance,&rdquo; the county Liquor Licensing Board chairman Vincent Shimoli said.He told the Star on Monday that those who fail the test will be compelled to use matatu or taxi and their cars towed to the county yard for safekeeping.&ldquo;Of course when they come for their cars they must pay for parking. We cannot keep them for free,&rdquo; Shimoli said.Drink-driving has been blamed for the many accidents in the capital. The NTSA arrests motorists who fail the test.&ldquo;We are also partnering with police and taxi firms to make this exercise a success. Remember, more than 85 per cent of accidents on our roads are caused by human error,&rdquo; Shimoli said.Read: NTSA denies alcoblow shortage, intensifies operationsAlso read: Three Die In Fatal Accidents Along Thika Highway Evading Alcoblow
