Four people were yesterday charged with assault and incitement to violence at the Malindi law courts. The case involves pastoralists, their local workers and some members of the Giriama communities. They are feuding over land in Kulesa area of Magarini subcounties. The suspects are Harrison Thoya, alias Furaha, Gilbert Mbaruku, Mtawali Charo and Kenga Kazungu, alias Masishu. They denied the charges before Malindi senior resident magistrate Yvonne Khatambi. On December 5 in Kulesa village, Magarini subcounty, Furaha allegedly told Karisa Andrew and Rimba Gona, &ldquo;Why are you working for the Somalis, whom we do not want in Giriama? We want them to go back to their land. If you continue, we shall burn them and you too."The magistrate said she would rule on January 3 on Furaha&rsquo;s bail application. The case for the other three continues today.
