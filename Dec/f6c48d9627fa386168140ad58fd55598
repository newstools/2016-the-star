The Kakamega chairman of the now-defunct TNA, Desmond Shinaka, yesterday accused MPs allied to the Jubilee Party of sidelining members from other parties that folded into JP.He said the MPs run the party like personal property and are only active when Deputy President William Ruto visits. &ldquo;As members of Jubilee we want everybody to be involved in the strategy to market JP in the county,&rdquo; Shinaka said.But Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali said no one is sidelined since there are no clear party structures since the merger on September 10. &ldquo;Everyone is doing the marketing they way he or she wants," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to tour Western for a week from Thursday next week.
