Olympian Peter Mungai has moved up a berth to flyweight from light-flyweight as the Sportpesa League Champions Kenya Police seek to beef up the team for the new season.Police coach George &ldquo;Foreman&rdquo; Onyango disclosed that Mungai is moving up from his traditional weight division to pave the way for the team&rsquo;s new sensation Shafie Bakari.&ldquo;Shafie and Mungai are two very skillful boxers and we believe they can both fight well at different weight classes. Shafie is among the five boxers we signed in 2016 and is an astute student of the game. He is one guy we are banking on for the Kenya team next season,&rdquo; said Onyango.Police constable Mungai became the second Kenyan boxer to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games after the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee revealed they did not recognise Sibusiso Bandla&rsquo;s qualification in the Cameroon qualifiers in March.The then light-flyweight qualified in a similar way the Kenyan women&rsquo;s Sevens Rugby team did, by replacing South Africa after they were refused the chance by the country&rsquo;s Olympic committee.Mungai will now fight Martyin Oduori and Issa Mwangi for a position in the flyweight division.Police will field Boniface Mugunde at welterweight with veteran Silas Omanyala retaining his middleweight spot.&ldquo;In fact, we are looking into exploring in-depth into the team and weighing our options in the middleweight class. We might get a new boxer to help Omanyala as we are seeking to enter a formidable team in the league,&rdquo; said Onyango who took over the coaching of the Police team from the 1987 All Africa Games gold medalist Patrick &ldquo;Mont&rdquo; Waweru.Onyango added they will only be signing two boxers next season.&ldquo;We are content with the current crop of boxers in the team considering that we recruited heavily in the just ended season. &lsquo;Foreman&rsquo;, a former Commonwealth Games gold medalist, said they will reveal the names of their two new boxers early in the 2017 season once they pass out from Police college.Ethan Maina, one of the newcomers in the team will retain his position at lightweight. The same as international Elly Ajowi at light-heavyweight.Tobias Okeyo will also be the main man at heavyweight whilst Simon Kimani and Anthony Kinoti will fight for the super-heavyweight slot.Police will begin their assignment in 2017 with the Novices in January and Intermediates in February.They begin their title defence in March hoping to arrest their arch-rivals Kenya Defence Forces (KDF).&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the soldiers will be coming hard at us and will try their hardest to wrestle the title from us,&rdquo; said Onyango.
