Two ODM MPs have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare his interest in the revived Webuye Pan Paper Mills.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and his Nyando counterpart Fred Outa wondered why Uhuru used taxpayers money to launch a private investment.The mill, which was put under receivership 10 years ago, will now operate as Rai Pan Paper following acquisition by the Rai family."As the President launches the Pan Paper mills, we want him to declare his personal interest in this private company," Wandayi said during a press conference at Parliament Buildings."The public can&rsquo;t finance the President to launch a private company. That is a big scandal in the making," he said.Read: Uhuru reopens Webuye Pan Paper during Western tourAlso read: LBDA director told me to stop query on cash &ndash; SavulaThe two MPs also alleged of a "well-calculated scheme" by the government to privatise the iconic Sh3.9 billion Kisumu mall set up at the Lake Basin Development Authority headquarters.They said the investment has not been handed over by the contractor and that the financier - Co-operative Bank - has not paid up - interest has been accruing at a rate of Sh145 million a day.The Devolution ministry has turned to Attorney General Githu Muigai for a legal opinion before the handover."This is part of the scheme to dilly dally the process to facilitate privatisation," the legislators said in a statement."Under the circumstances we can only deduce one thing; that this procrastination is part of a wider strategy to have the landmark property eventually auctioned for a song to well-connected individuals within the Jubilee administration." The MPs appealed to the President to intervene within two days or face protests by hundreds of Kisumu residents."The residents risk deprivation and economic marginalisation if the project is handed over to private developers," Outa said.
