Boniface Mwangi is looking for a job. It may have come as no surprise when, during the launch of his book two weeks ago, he declared he would berunning for a parliamentary seat. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should welcome it with open arms.Over the last few months we have been treated to similar announcements by journalists, clergy and civil society activists. And it is all depressingly reminiscentof 2002 and the dash for elected positions under the National Alliance Rainbow Coalition banner. And, in the euphoria of giving Daniel Arap Moi the fi nger, we did not think twice about the future eff ect of decapitating the organisations that had been instrumental in delivering that moment.Well, that future was not long in coming. Very soon after the Kibaki administration, packed rafters with &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; -the same ones who had told Moi, in the famous words of Kiraitu Murungi, to tend his goats and &ldquo;watch how a country should be governed&rdquo; took over the old habits of looting and state-sponsored violence resurfaced.This time, though, the culprits were our former heroes. &ldquo;Anglo Leasing was &lsquo;us&rsquo; &ndash; our people&rdquo;, Mr Murungi would later admit.The &ldquo;eating&rdquo; was all the worse since these were the same people who had formerly stood up to the Nyayo regime and whose rapture into government had hollowed out the civil society and religious organisations that were so critical in holding it to account. So today, as tales of grand corruption fill the headlines, we should refl ect upon the experience of 15 years ago and look to keep our &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; in the positionswhere they serve us best and where they can keep government on a short leash.Foreign Aff airs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed is also looking for a job. The government has proposed her as the next head of the African Union Commission and is spending millions of our tax shillings to lobby heads of state across the continent to give it to her. But she is already contracted to represent and lobby for our common interests abroad and has instead spent most of her time instead protecting the interests of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy, William Ruto.Despite the clear stipulation in the constitution that &ldquo;the President may be prosecuted under any treaty to which Kenya is party and which prohibits such immunity&rdquo;, which the Treaty of Rome does, Secretary Mohamed racked up frequent flyer miles and staked Kenya&rsquo;s international prestige and interests on a shameful effort topressure the International Criminal Court into dropping the crimes against humanity charges facing the duo. Yet she has been conspicuously quiet on the plight of ordinary Kenyans unfairly banged up abroad. Currently, next door in South Sudan four Kenyans havebeen sentenced to life imprisonment following sham proceedings in which no specifi c accusations of wrongdoing were levelled against them. Efforts to get Secretary Mohamed to intervene and raise the issue with the South Sudanese government have borne little fruit, despite her frequent travels toJuba to shore up the peace process there and the clear leverage Kenya has over the Juba elite.Andrew Franklin is also in search of employment. Along with around 750 Kenyans, the former US marine who has been living and working in Kenya for over three decades, applied for consideration as either Chair or Member of a reconstituted Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.Two weeks ago, the selection panel announced it had shortlisted five out of fourteen applicants for Chairperson and another 31 for Members. Mr Franklin did not make either cut. That, in itself, is not troubling. What is worrying is the opaqueness with which the shortlists were developed.Since last Friday, when the selection panel announced it was suspending the interviews for Chairperson after questions were raised about the suitabilityof the shortlisted candidates, there has been disturbingly little querying either in the media or by civil society of criteria used to exclude 720 people fromthe process of public scrutiny. That the panel itself has off ered no information on this gives rise to suspicions of underhand dealings and political interference in the process. Given our pastexperience with the consequences of messing with the credibility of electoral bodies, it should give all of us pause for thought. These three examples evince our dangerously cavalier approach to distributing public positions. For the sake of the country, Boniface Mwangi and others like him should keep doing the jobs they already have. Which is not only to ensure Amina Mohamed and her government colleagues start doing theirs before we spend tax shillings to get them employed elsewhere, but that the likes of Andrew Franklin and 720 Kenyans are accorded a fair hearing for the public jobs they have applied for.
