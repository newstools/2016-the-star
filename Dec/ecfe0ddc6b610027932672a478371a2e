Loss-making Mumias Sugar Company is grappling with a Sh11 billion debt accrued from investments in &ldquo;white elephant projects&rdquo;, Dan Ameyo, the firm's chairman who retired on Friday said.The debt largely includes commercial bank loans which the miller took to finance the construction of a water, ethanol and power plants. Ameyo said the miller is straining to meet the obligation of repaying the debt since some of the projects are inactive.&ldquo;The projects have sunk money and are not adding adequate value to the company,&rdquo; he told shareholders during the annual general meeting on Friday at Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu. Ameyo has been chairman of Mumias since February 2014.Despite the challenges, he said, the factory was operating and has improved productivity by 10 per cent.He reassured farmers that the factory is regaining momentum despite the challenging recovery path.The miller reported a loss of Sh4.73 billion in the half-year period for 2016 financial year from Sh4.64 billion in the same period last year.However, revenues surged 13.6 per cent to Sh6.28 billion from Sh5.53 billion.The miller received a Sh2.1 billion state bailout earlier this year to help in the restructuring of its operations.Mumias chief executive Errol Johnston dismissed claims that the bailout was not prudently used.He said Sh1.5 billion (60 per cent) of the funds was spent on settling arrears to cane farmers.In June, the company paid Sh600 million owed to farmers, leaving it with a balance of about Sh650 million.&ldquo;We have plans to offset the outstanding debt to farmers,&rdquo; he said.He said the miller has put in place new strategies to help farmers in cane development in a bid to increase production of the raw material.This is because of the persistent cane shortage in the Western sugar belt which has resulted to increased cane poaching by rival millers.&ldquo;The company is guiding farmers on modern methods of cane development,&rdquo; Johnston said.
