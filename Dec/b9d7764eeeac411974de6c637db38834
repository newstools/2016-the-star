Just
who is protecting a political activist from Mumias and the larger
Kakamega County? The activist, a man who is said to have never gone
beyond class three, is the sole problem to the local police. He is said
to have been mentioned in the probe into the attack and robbery on
Booker police post where seven guns were stolen and a police injured. He
has also been linked to violence experienced in the area. But the cops
there cant touch him. Reasons? He is being protected by the high and
might in the government. He has even vowed not to allow any rally of
opponents to take place there. Police are worried because they have
summoned him twice only to be called from above and politicians and
asked to go slow. Our mole say it is a matter of time before more chaos
erupt in the area out of the political interference from
above....Corridors is watching.  ********** Jubilee 
political strategists are seeking to reactivate their "moles" inside the
opposition seeking to establish who is sponsoring the heckling of
Jubilee leaders. In a meeting held on Monday night at a restaurant in
Kilimani area, the Jubilee strategists resolved to ensure that they get
to the bottom of the matter. Insiders have told corridors that it is
possible that it was the opposition that was behind the rowdy youths who
were tearing and burning t-shirts in Garissa when DP William Ruto was hosted by Majority Leader in the National Assembly Aden
Duale. They believe that opponents of Duale from the opposition are
behind the chaos and the sole phone video that was circulated on social
media. The Jubilee politicians have vowed to tame this situation saying
they will not allow anyone to disrespect the President or the Deputy
President.  *********** Have some Cord MPs already lost hope in their leader Raila Odinga
winning 2017 polls? Our mole tells Corridors that a Cord MP was heard
telling his Jubilee counterpart that there is no doubt President Uhuru
Kenyatta will retain his seat after next year's August polls. The Cord
legislators said Kenyatta's Mt. Kenya stronghold has registered many
voters and that voter turn out will be above 98 per cent. He went on
that although his region has recorded a similar number of voters, their
turn out will be poor making Raila to lose.  *********** A
 female politician in Nairobi county is being accused by her colleagues
of using them to get money and them moving to the next one. Two male
aspirants for Nairobi Governor were heard saying that the politician has
over the last two years used them to get favours and has now moved on
to one of their rivals. They have now vowed to ensure she does not get
the Jubilee ticket for woman rep.
