Thousands of Embu county&rsquo;s Mwea Settlement Scheme squatters on Thursday cut trees and dragged them across two busy roads to demand title deeds.They said they have been denied title deeds in the distribution of 7,232 plots in the 54,000 acres. The squatters said they number more than 10,000, but of the 7,232 title deeds issued, only 1,000 of them received the documents. They said politicians, business people, officials and their friends got the rest.The squatters staged two protests at Makima and Gachuriri shopping centres, where they blocked Machanga-Makima and Gachoka Gachuriri roads.AP officers fought running battles with squatters and finally controlled the situation.But motorists were stuck, as APs did not have power saws to cut the remove the trees.Land goes to the wealthyThe squatters said most of the land has been given to outsiders and land grabbers, including local politicians, businessmen and officers of the county and national governments. They said they have lived on the land for many decades and have nowhere to go.&ldquo;We have been discriminated against and the government should cancel the title deeds already issued. There should be fresh distribution to the rightful owners,&rdquo; a demonstrator said.They said they were never consulted by so-called committees that went round jotting down names of beneficiaries. The squatters said most of the land has been distributed to people who can buy their own land.They have staged a number of demonstrations. Two weeks ago they urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to cancel the title deeds and ensure justice is done.No word from State House.
