President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday directed the examination council (Knec) to cease using of index numbers and replace it with a registration identifier.This will have unique personal identifier (UPI) in Student Registration Numbers (SRNs) that they will use throughout their presence, at all levels, in the Kenya education system.The directive, which will be effective 2017, was issued during a meeting with education officials ahead of the release of KCSE 2016 results in Mombasa.Uhuru also directed the Ministry of Education to put in place plans to institutionalise ongoing reforms to ensure sustainability and entrenchment.Education CS Fred Matiang'i, while addressing teachers at Shimo la Tewa High School, communicated the presidents' directive to teachers."We want to announce that there will be no more use of index numbers effective 2017 for registration of our students," the CS said.Read: KCSE 2016 results: Only 141 As from over 88,900 candidates with C+ and above"...this will be replaced by the registration numbers which a student will use all through as he or she advances in education," Matiang'i said.The CS pointed out that the registration number will be used across all levels of studies from Primary School, Secondary and University.Matiangi said the registration number will help the government track academic records of students."We will now be able to keep the records of a student right from the time they enter primary school to the time they go to campus," Matiangi said.John Owino, a director in the Education Ministry, told the Star that the registration number would also be used in evaluation of the cost of education."If you go to the ministry right now and ask what is the cost of educating a Kenyan child, it is hard for you to establish an accurate answer. But this registration number will ease that," Owino said.He added that the registration numbers will enable the ministry to fight cases of fake education certificates in the country."One can establish when an individual drops out of school through follow up of the status of the unique student code," he said.Also read: Education officials brief Uhuru ahead of release of KCSE results
