Kanu national chairman Gideon Moi and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto will open Chama Cha Mashinani office in Salgaa town, Nakuru, today. CCM national organising secretary Joshua Cheruiyot said Gideon and Rutto will first chair a meeting of more than 500 leaders from across the country. He said leaders expected include Kuresoi South MP Zakayo Cheruiyot, Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, Kanu secretary general Nick Salat and Emurua Dikkir MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno. Cheruiyot said several Rift Valley leaders who do not have confidence in the Jubilee Party have shown interest in joining CCM. &ldquo;Lately, our party has registered several leaders who have foreseen the shattering of JP after nominations,&rdquo; he said.
