Mombasa MCAs have accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of favouring Central Kenya residents.This follows Tuesday s announcement that the government will waive the Sh2.4 billion debt coffee farmers in the region owe the government.Nominated MCA Mohamed Hatimy and his Tononoka counterpart Saad Faraj yesterday said Uhuru in January forced squatters on the controversial Waitiki Farm to pay Sh1.25 billion for them to get title deeds and to be settled on the farm because Mombasa did not vote for him .They now want the Jubilee government to reimburse residents. The President has gone against the Constitution and the oath he took to serve all Kenyans justly and without discrimination, the MCAs said in a statement.Hatimy and Faraj also cited the December 2011 write-off of a Sh3.7 billion debt coffee farmers in the Mt Kenya region owed financial institutions when Uhuru was Finance minister. That is acrobatic politics that will not help. I ask Mombasa people to open their eyes and see how things are being done. Are we people of Mombasa any less than the people of Central? Hatimy said.In April, the Mombasa assembly passed a motion allowing the county to pay off the debt.
