Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has endorsed Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo and businessman William Oduol for Siaya governor race.Midiwo said the two are best suited to spur Siaya county to greater heights in terms of development compared to governor Cornel Rasanga. On Monday, the MP apologised to Oduol campaigning against him in favour of Rasanga during the 2013 general election.Midiwo stated categorically that his vote and support will remain for a Gumbo-Oduol partnership whether they fail or win the August 8 vote.The two politicians have formed a political alliance with a sole purpose of removing Rasanga from power during the 2017 poll.The two, eying the seat through an ODM ticket, have vowed to back each other in the event that one of them wins the party's nominations.Gumbo said that his major interest in the seat is to liberate the people of Siaya from poverty, by introducing viable development projects.He asked nominated MP Oburu Oginga to support his (Gumbo's) governorship bid, but the latter has said he will do what it takes to ensure that Rasanga is re-elected.Oduol, while calling upon Siaya residents to support their alliance, exuded confidence that they will win the election.Read: Rasanga has failed, Midiwo says, to name choice Siaya governor in December
