Shortly after lawmakers brawled in Parliament, President Uhuru Kenyatta pronounced some MPs "idiots" using the august house to insult him at will.He did not refer to the MPs from both sides who threw punches &mdash; and even used pepper spray &mdash; on Tuesday night during a tempestuous session on amending electoral laws. It was aborted and the video feed cancelled so the public could not see the scrimmage.The same could happen today in two sittings.Jubilee is pushing for changes, the opposition says weakened laws will be used to rig the election.The President commented about idiots on Tuesday night, just hours after Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo was caught on camera hurling insults at him."On our left is the National Assembly representing democracy, but it has also given some idiots the ability to keep insulting me," Uhuru said as he presided over lighting the KICC for the festive season.Saying he was not legally elected, Odhiambo told Uhuru to stop harassing Kenyans with heavy-handed security, a cordon and water cannons around Parliament."I dedicated this day to telling the President all the negative things. Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is extremely stupid and a fake President, as his own backyard is poor," she said.Yesterday, the President hammered home the insults and idiots issue as he reopened the Volkswagen Kenya production line at Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers factory in Thika."They are looking for a wrong person with insults and intimidation. I have no time for confrontations. We will soldier on with our agenda for development because it&rsquo;s even said frogs&rsquo; eyes cannot prevent cows from taking water," Uhuru said.[VIDEO] Kenyans react to Millie Odhiambo's remarks that Uhuru is 'a fake President'Uhuru responds to Millie Odhiambo with a Christmas cardWe resist the Chepkonga ballot stuffing optionHe spoke as the IEBC and the Communication Authority of Kenya met MPs to fine-tune the controversial amendments that turned Parliament into a battleground.Expect turmoil today in sessions to wrap up business. Neither side has budged.Uhuru said, "I won't stop nor be discouraged by noise and insults peddled by a few individuals because every market has its own mad man."The opposition is trying to force a coalition government by sowing doubts and causing divisions and chaos about the election next August, Uhuru said."Kenyans are tired of retrogressive politics. Attempts to delay elections to get nusu mkate won't work. We want an election enabling Kenyans to form the government they want and nobody will prevent that," Uhuru said.He repeated the opposition has no agenda, adding it is best at insulting leaders and relying on intimidation instead of helping Kenyans.&ldquo;We are on a mission to revive many industries so our youth can get employment opportunities," Uhuru said "The other day we were in Webuye to open Pan Paper Mills and we will head to Eldoret to open RiverTex Company and many others countrywide," he said.The President was joined by Thika town MP Alice Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a and Kiambu Governor William Kabogo.&ldquo;We cannot allow a few people to dictate how things will be done. Kenyans must be given space to peacefully exercise their democratic rights," he said.Uhuru promised the election will be peaceful, transparent and open. He said the IEBC needs space and resources to oversee the polls.&ldquo;We have an independent commission mandated to run elections and it will ensure all Kenyans elect chosen leaders calmly. Elections are for over 40 million, not a few people seeking to advance narrow selfish intentions by trying to cause chaos,&rdquo; the President said.Jubilee supports the IEBC request for amendments to allow a manual voting alternative if electronic voter identification and results transmission fail.Cord says this will allow Jubilee to sneak in easy-to-manipulate manual voter identification and steal the election.The chaos on Tuesday forced National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to abruptly adjourn the session.Sources told the Star Muturi was forced to call two special sessions today after senior Jubilee officials gave him a dressing down over the tumult and failed session. He was criticised for giving the opposition leeway to interrupt and block amendments.Instead, Muturi extended the session for 55 minutes, in which the opposition raised points of order. The session aborted.After the violence, Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma urged Muturi to punish Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi for using pepper spray in his face.Kaluma told the Star Majority Leader Aden Duale moved time be extended until business was concluded."We voted, the Jubilee side had won ... We were chatting with Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri as the bell rang," Kaluma said.He said Murugi and three woman reps &mdash; Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi), Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua) and Sabina Chege (Muranga) &mdash; surrounded Millie Odhiambo who had insulted Uhuru.Kaluma said, "We removed Millie ... As we chatted and laughed, Murugi sneaked in between and before I noticed,there was a lot of spray directly in my face and my eyes."
