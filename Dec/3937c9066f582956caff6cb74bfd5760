Following the successful 2016 Black Friday campaign, Jumia Travel has launched a campaign dubbed &ldquo;Travel Wednesday&rdquo; running every Wednesday to Friday on the company&rsquo;s official website.&ldquo;This is designed to meet our customers&rsquo; demand to have access to affordable travel options through Jumia Travel. Following the impressive public response on Black Friday, we want to create a new appointment for all travellers, an opportunity to get more deals that we have negotiated with thousands of hotels across Africa,&rdquo; noted Paul Midy, CEO of Jumia Travel.The campaign&rsquo;s main objective is to carry on readily negotiated rates referred to as &ldquo;Dream Deals&rdquo; with the aim of encouraging and facilitating travel through the year.With 2017 having been designated as the &ldquo;Year of Sustainable Travel&rdquo; at the United Nations 70th General Assembly, one of the major goals for industry players will be to draw policies that contribute to inclusive and sustainable economic growth throughout the seasons in the tourism circuit.While initially a maximum of 8 hotel deals will run during the promotion, they will in the coming days be increased to a total of 12 deals running until every Wednesday and Friday.The deals have been launched in African countries where the company has been on the forefront in providing accommodation and travel packages within the means of most travelers. They include Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Algeria.As in the case of Black Friday, the Dream Deals will also be co-marketed across all Jumia ecosystem in the countries they operate in.&ldquo;More than 25% of our Black Friday bookings came from the Jumia ecosystem. Thus, it is vital to continue working closely with our sister companies to increase the traffic of the customer, as this was the main objective of the rebranding&rdquo; added Midy.
