KMPDU Secretary general Ouma Oluga has accused Bomet governor Isaac Rutto of assaulting doctors&rsquo; union officials.He claimed that the governor, accompanied by 30 youths, stormed and disrupted a meeting convened by the medics at a hotel in Bomet on Wednesday.One of the meeting's attendees, who sought anonymity, claimed that the county boss called in the youth after his request to address the meeting was declined. "The officials both from the national and the county government were holding their meeting when Rutto came in and requested to talk to the officials," the source said.The source said that the union officials declined the request on grounds that they did not want to engage the governor."Rutto then went and sat on a table waiting...after some minutes, youths arrived in a vehicle and started disrupting the meeting," he said.The source said one of the youths slapped the doctors' union Bomet chairman, kicked and tore clothes of some female medics.And in a statement to the media, Oluga alleged that they were briefed that Rutto initially removed his gun to scare the doctors.He said the he will take strong action to have the governor account for his intolerance and violence."The governor has resorted to violence on his own doctors after his media propaganda fell flat on the public. Intimidation will not implement the CBA," Oluga said.When contacted by the Star on the matter, Governor Rutto dismissed the doctor's allegations, adding that he doesn't own a gun."I don't own a gun and if those officials claim that I have one, let them produce the records. I have never applied for a firearm," he said.He further said that they had issued a warning against any attempts to interrupt services at health facilities in the county."We issued a warning that they will face the wrath of the people. Why would some people come here to disrupt health services?" he asked.Read: You face sack if you strike, Bomet medics warnedAlso read: Bomet medics receive Sh1.5m gift from Rutto
