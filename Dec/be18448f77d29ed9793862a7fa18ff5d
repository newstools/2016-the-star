Nurses unanimously have called off their strike after the 47 county governments signed an agreement to recognise their union.The Kenya National Union of Nurses also fully accepted the salary rise they were offered by the government on Sunday.The dissenting General Secretary, Seth Panyako, yesterday ratified the Sunday's salary agreement and joined union chairman John Biiy in signing the recognition agreement with the counties.&ldquo;All nurses should now return to work immediately,&rdquo; Panyako said.&ldquo;Some of the issues the National Governing Council raised on Monday have been reached and we have a letter from the Health CS (Cleopa Mailu) confirming the rest will be addressed.&rdquo;The Sunday salary agreement shows that all nurses in job groups G - L will get a monthly allowance of Sh20,000 and those in group M and above will get Sh15,000.The increase will be paid in two tranches of 60 per cent in January next year and 40 per cent in July.Yesterday's signing of the recognition agreement took place at the council of governors offices in Nairobi.It was witnessed by 12 governors including council of governors chair Peter Munya, and Health CS Dr Cleopa Mailu.The recognition agreement paves way for the counties to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the nurses, beginning next month.Until that CBA is finalised and implemented, the nurses will hang on to the Sunday salary agreement.&ldquo;Once we have signed the recognition, the CBA negotiation process will begin in January,&rdquo; Munya said.Dr Mailu said once a new CBA is negotiated, it will hold for four years within which the nurses cannot call a strike.&ldquo;A nurse is the advocate of the hospital. A patient remains in hospital with the nurse when the doctor prescribes medicine and goes home,&rdquo; he said.Nurses went on strike two weeks ago demanding salary rise of up to 50 per cent.They also wanted harmonisation of their grading scales and special perks like car loans and mortgage.Clinicians also called off their strike on Tuesday saying they have given the government 45 days to register the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers.Only doctors working in public facilities remain on strike. Last week, Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials walked out of talks with the government after Industrial Court judge Helen Wasilwa ruled their strike is illegal.They are expected to show cause as to why they should not be committed to civil jail for disobeying a court order stopping the strike.
