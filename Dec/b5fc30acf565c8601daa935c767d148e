The High Court yesterday temporarily stopped the Kenya Airports Authority from recruiting a new general manager for projects and engineering services. Justice Monica Mbaru of the Employment and Labour Relation Court said KAA should not appoint or fill the vacancy pending hearing and determination of the case. The judge certified the lawsuit filed by activist Okiya Omtatah (pictured) and directed him to serve KAA, Public Service Commission, State Corporation Advisory Committee, Engineers Board of Kenya and the Attorney General with the suit papers immediately. The case will be heard on January 9.In the case, Omtata says Eric Nyangesi, Cecilia Magner and Cosmas Lang&rsquo;at &ndash; the three candidates who have been shortlisted for the job &ndash; are not qualified. He alleges the three, whose names have been forwarded to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for scrutiny and clearance, were shortlisted without adhering to laid down constitutional procedures.&ldquo;The candidates are unqualified as they lack both training and experience in airport infrastructure&rdquo;, Omtata says.The activist argues that appointing unqualified people to such a critical position might lead to substandard infrastructure at the airports, which include runaways and terminals, saying buildings that do not adhere to the standards prescribed by International Civil Authority would put many lives at risk.
