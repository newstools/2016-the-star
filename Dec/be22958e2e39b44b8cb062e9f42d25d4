It was just a matter of discipline in doing the right thing, when andwhere,&rdquo; he said. Oliseh is in the country on a threeday tour courtesy of StarTimes and DFL Sports, the governing arm of the German Bundesliga.&ldquo;Respective governments and football associations should invest in football academies to churn talent,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The German system is the best for Africa to emulate since it involves more passing and creativity that is abundant in Africa as opposed to the English Premier League which is end to end,&rdquo; observed Oliseh.&ldquo;Focusing on the youth,&rdquo; said the Super Eagles legend, &ldquo;is the only way to propel African countries into being contenders at the world stage, say, the World Cup.&rdquo;
