ODM will reject plans by the electoral agency to register diaspora voters as it is a ploy to rig next year's elections, an official has said.Secretary for political affairs Opiyo Wandayi said, &ldquo;The number of diaspora voters is unknown. Even the embassies in those areas do not have official identity of the Kenyans residing there.&rdquo;He spoke on Saturday at Got Osimbo Girls Secondary School during the commissioning of a dining hall sponsored by the CDF.The Ugunja MP said ODM will insist that registration of potential voters is done in Kenya and not outside the country.He claimed Jubilee is hell-bent on maligning the names of some ODM legislators over the controversial NYS scandal.Wandayi claimed that National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale falsely accused ODM chairman John Mbadi of benefiting from teh National Youth Service missing funds through a company associated to him.The NYS has lost more than Sh1.6 billion in the scandal that is currently being investigated.&ldquo;There is no way Jubilee can try to dissociate itself from the NYS scandal since it has all the investigative mechanisms, including the EACC and CID, to find those culpable,&rdquo; Wandayi said.He asked the Jubilee administration to carry its own cross on wanton corruption.
