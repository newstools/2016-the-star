Some female MPs are an angry lot. Reason? The Jubilee legislators are very unhappy with their male counterparts, especially those from ODM,who publicly defended Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel (pictured) after assaulting his Nominated counterpart Sarah Korere. Our mole tells Corridors some MPs were heard within Parliament bashing the ODM legislators and their leader Raila Odinga for participating in Lempurkel’s homecoming in Laikipia after the assault incident, then as now pending in court. The lawmakers went on to say they should expect more assault and intimidation from male politicians as they battle for elective seats. They said the Korere incident was just a drop in the ocean and a sign of political afflictions to come during the 2017 campaigns.  ************ Police units have been mobilized to monitor recently sacked Traffic police officers who failed to pass vetting. There are fears they may join crime gangs and become hard to manage. Most of the officers are juniors and had been in the service for a long time with experience that may affect crime busting. But the affected officers have vowed to appeal and be reinstated after one of their former seniors was reinstated following an appeal. The officer was adversely mentioned during his vetting for having received money via M-Pesa from juniors.  ************ Still on Traffic matters, some county commanders are said to be out to settle scores with the officers who have been ordered to report to them for operational purposes. This is after the commanders said they were being despised and ignored by the Traffic officers in the past whenever they sought favours and help on petty offenders. The Police Service Commission ordered the devolution of Traffic operations to enable the officers to report to county commanders as opposed to the case in the past when they reported to Traffic Headquarters.  ************ Seems corruption has become so entrenched and institutionalized that the police are even notified by potential suspects before crimes are committed to provide the necessary protection or “air cover”. Corridors of Power is wondering what happened to the philosophy of preventing crimes before they happen! For instance, look at the number of land-grabbing cases where the police shield the suspects even as they demolish structures, including homes, and intimidate the real owners. And these ruthless demolition squads who have armed police escorts always strike at at night. The cartels also have patently forged documents - and yet they are never arrested.
