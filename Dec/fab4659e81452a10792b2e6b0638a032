US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday nominated Dr Ben Carson to serve as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)."I am honored to accept the opportunity to serve our country in the Trump administration," Carson said in a statement.As recently as last week, Carson had told The Washington Post he was not interested in a Cabinet job, saying, "Having me as a federal bureaucrat would be like a fish out of water." Carson, a popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, has been a close adviser to Trump and is a vice chairman of Trump's transition team. He has been mentioned as a possible secretary of health and human services or education. In November, Carson's business manager, Armstrong Williams, said Carson has made clear he has no experience in running a federal bureaucracy. "Dr Carson doesn't feel like that's the best way for him to serve the president-elect," Williams told Reuters.He said Carson would remain a close adviser of Trump and a friend. "His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary,"
