AFC Leopards seek to topple defending champions Mathare as they face off in the third edition of the Kenya Premier League Under-20 final today at Camp Toyoyo starting 2pm.For the first time since the tournament&rsquo;s inception, Ingwe managed to get to the final having bowed out twice at the quarterfinal stage.During the first edition, Ingwe lost 2-1 to Gor Mahia and were later whipped by the current champions Mathare 4-1 after post match penalties following a 1-1 draw last August. Today, Leopards will be seeking to right their wrongs in the last two editions though it is not going to be easy considering they are up against champions.AFC will capitalise on the presence of their three key players &mdash; midfielder Harun Nyaka and forwards Eric Kinuthia and Mathew Kono&mdash; who sat out during their 2-1 win against Sofapaka in semis. The three are expected to form the starting line up today and coach Boniface Ambani is upbeat about their contribution. The three were locked out of semis after receiving two yellow cards in the quarters, where they thrashed Bandari 5-1. Speaking after a training session yesterday, Ambani praised his charges for their effort in the latest edition.&ldquo;We came into this edition with the mission of winning having missed out twice at critical stages. Training and preparations has been the same all along even as we head into tomorrow&rsquo;s (today) clash against Mathare. There is no special training for a final, since according to me, things have gone according to plan,&rdquo; said Ambani.&ldquo;The match will be difficult considering Mathare&rsquo;s style of play. We plan to take on them with the seriousness they deserve. During this edition, we had a policy of scoring fast goals and that always made our opponents chase after goals throughout the matches,&rdquo; he added. Gor Mahia will face Sofapaka in the third and fourth play-off at 10am. This edition has witnessed a total of 92 goals scored.
