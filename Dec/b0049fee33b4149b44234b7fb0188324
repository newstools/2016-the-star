At least 100 GSU officers have been dispatched to quell violence and restore calm after fighting intensified between two rival clans in Kerio Valley.Two people were killed and 25 houses torched when fighting broke out between Kapshoi and Kapsiren clans on Monday and Tuesday.Security agents said the attacks complicate the fight against cattle theft. Kaben chief Joseph Lokanda said one person was killed on Monday, leading to a revenge attack on Tuesday in which the second person was killed.He said the GSU officers deployed on Wednesday have restored calm. Monday&rsquo;s fighting was sparked by the killing of two people by suspected Pokot attackers on Sunday.The Kapsiren accused Kapshoi of harbouring the assailants, who had murdered a school watchman and a villager in Liter. The fighting lasted 36 hours. Tot resident Wilson Kiptoo said people have fled the area and tension remains high. &ldquo;Tot trading centre has been deserted,&rdquo; he said. Marakwet East deputy county commissioner Eric Mulevu said police are pursuing suspects. Former IG David Kimaiyo, a Kerio Valley resident, condemned the attacks. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene.&ldquo;Otherwise, we shall continue losing lives,&rdquo; he said. Kimaiyo said the resurgence of inter-clan violence will derail efforts to end banditry between the Marakwet and Pokot. Deputy President William Ruto, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and IG Joseph Boinnet visited in October, but the attacks have persisted.
