Jubilee MCAs have threatened to sue to block the Nairobi government s Urban Renewal Programme.Speaking during a press conference at City Hall yesterday, the MCAs, led by minority leader Abdi Guyo, said Eastlands residents were not adequately consulted. The project will see hundreds of residents displaced. The county is not telling us where all these people will go. There are no alternatives for these people and as leaders, we will not allow that, Guyo said.In March, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero appointed a 17-member team to head the Urban Renewal Technical Committee. The team is expected to streamline issues before construction starts.The county seeks to build between 10,000 and 12,000 affordable housing units in partnership with the private sector.The first phase will include projects in Old and New Ngara, Pangani, Jeevanjee, Ngong Road Inspectorate staff quarters, Uhuru and Suna Road.
