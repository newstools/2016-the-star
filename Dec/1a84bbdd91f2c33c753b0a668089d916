Jubilee is an opposition party in the Rift Valley, Bomet Governor and Chama Cha Mashinani leader Isaac Rutto has said.He said to the Kalenjin community, especially in Bomet, Jubilee is a forgotten party.&ldquo;I have mobilised all leaders in my county, including MCAs, to join CCM. My mission is to mobilise leaders in the entire region to ditch Jubilee,&rdquo; Rutto said. He said he is committed to popularising CMM in the entire Rift Valley to end Jubilee dominance. Rutto accused Jubilee leaders of being corrupt and failing in their development mandate, adding those supporting the outfit seem not to understand their rights.He spoke on Thursday during a fundraiser for women in Bartolimo, Baringo North subcounty.&ldquo;I thank Kanu leaders for standing truthfully to support the Independence party after it was deserted by the current party hoppers who call themselves the Jubilee Party,&rdquo; Rutto said.The county chief told off Deputy President William Ruto against silencing the Kalenjin community from agitating for their rights.He urged residents to vote out Jubilee leaders at next year&rsquo;s election.His address comes barely two weeks after he returned from South Africa, where he was treated after police hit him in the face with a stray tear gas canister.Rutto&rsquo;s sentiments were backed by Kanu leader and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, Kanu secretary general Nick Salat, Emurrua Dikirr MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno and Kanu Rift valley coordinator John Bii.Moi told President Uhuru Kenyatta the Kalenjin community does not trust Ruto and he should camp in the region for his reelection bid. At the weekend, Uhuru and Ruto were in the South Rift to popularise JP.
