South Sudan's president on Thursday denied allegations by the United Nations that ethnic cleansing in the country's conflict is so bad that the stage is set for genocide. "There's no such thing in South Sudan. There's no ethnic cleansing," President Salva Kiir told Reuters in the South African city of Johannesburg. Security guards prevented further questions.On Thursday, a UN commissioner reported that ethnic cleansing was ongoing in the war-torn nation.The commission on human rights compared it with the Rwandan genocide and cited starvation, gang rape and the burning of village."Everywhere we went across this country we heard villagers saying they are ready to shed blood to get their land back," commissioner Yasmin Sooka said in the statement.
