ALL eyes will be on the Senate today as it reconvenes for a special sitting to consider controversial changes to the electoral laws adopted by the National Assembly last week.The changes that include a manual backup system for voter identification and results transmission and the timeliness for the acquisition of election ICTs, significantly alter the Elections Laws (Amendments) Act 2016.The law arose from a negotiated agreement reached between Cord and Jubilee that ended the anti-IEBC protests.The settlement was midwifed by the Joint Select Committee on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, led by Senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru).If the Senate endorses the changes passed during the special sitting on Thursday last week and President Uhuru Kenyatta assents the Bill into law, the IEBC will have powers to use a manual voting system. Jubilee has said the manual voting system should be in place just in case technology fails. Cord has however opposed the manual system, with Raila Odinga claiming that it would create room for dead voters &ldquo;participating&rdquo; in the 2017 general election.The Kriegler Commission of Inquiry largely blamed the 2008 post-election violence on the use of a manual voting system and recommended major electoral reforms, among them the use of technology, in subsequent elections.The determination by the Jubilee leadership to have the law in place saw Cord MPs walk out of the House in protest on Thursday.Opposition leaders Raila, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula have opposed the changes, claiming that the action by the Jubilee leadership is a preliminary to rigging the 2017 elections.They have threatened mass action on January 4, 2017, if the President, whom they have accused of being behind the plot, signs the controversial changes into law.The Senate however has room to either accept or reject changes passed by the National Assembly.Yesterday, Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye said that every preparation has been made to facilitate the special sitting.&ldquo;All I can say is that the Senators will be in the House tomorrow [today] to consider what the National Assembly did last week,&rdquo; Nyegenye said.It is unlikely that the physical fight that played out in the National Assembly during the two acrimonious special sittings will carry over to the Senate, considering that it is generally a sober House.But what cannot be taken away is the likelihood that the vote will go along the coalition lines.According to the Senate standing orders, only the heads of delegation, in this case elected Senators, are required to vote on a matter that affects the counties.In their absence, they delegate to any of the nominated member from their county who will determine whether or not to vote in support of or against, after consulting the delegation heads.Every Senator is allowed to vote on a matter that does not affect the counties.The Senate consists of 47 members directly elected by their counties. There are an additional 16 women nominated by the political parties according to their relative strength in the Senate, while two more represent the youth and another two represent persons with disabilities, bringing the total number to 67.Going by the present party politics, the Jubilee side is likely going to marshall about 26 Senators against 21 from the Cord side.On Monday, Kwale Senator Boy Juma Boy preempted the debate by declaring that he will oppose the Bill.He took the blame to Uhuru's doorstep, accusing him of bulldozing MPs into changing the law for selfish interests against the negotiated deal between Cord and Jubilee to stop the anti-IEBC protests.&ldquo;As ODM and Cord, we are opposed to the amendments. Take the message to Uhuru,&rdquo; Juma said.Yesterday, Jubilee nominated Senator Ben Paul Njoroge also said he is opposed to the amended electoral laws.He said the move to amend the law is a plan to rig the coming general election.Njoroge, who represents the disabled in the Senate, pointed an accusing finger at Deputy President William Ruto, saying that he was the brain behind the amendment.Addressing the press in Naivasha, Njoroge termed the move by the ruling party MPs illegal, adding that no amendment should be carried out before a six-month interval."The Constitution was flouted and I join the Church and other stakeholders in asking the President not to sign the amendments," he said.Njoroge warned of chaos if the law went through, adding that President Uhuru should not allow the country descend into violence, as happened in 2007.The Senator lashed out at Cord leader Raila for his calls for mass action on January 4, saying that he was a beneficiary of rigging in 2007.&ldquo;Ruto and Raila were part of those calling for street action in 2007 and now they are at it again and we should not allow this,&rdquo; he said.However, as the Senate considers the Bill, it is emerging that the National Assembly ignored key recommendations of the IEBC.The Commission's proposals that MPs ignored included defining facial recognition, which had been omitted in the amended law. It was to read &ldquo;biometric, meaning unique identifiers or attributes &ndash; facial fingerprints, hand geometry, earlobe geometry, retina and iris patterns, voice waves, DNA and signatures&rdquo;.A proposal to provide Kenyans with alternative mechanisms for verification of registration through SMS was also not considered.Though the debate in the Senate will only be confined to what was passed in the National Assembly, it remains to be seen whether the House will endorse what Cord calls a &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; process.Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, a member of the Justice and Legal Affairs committee, accused his chairman, Samuel Chepkonga, of misleading the House into passing what had not been agreed on by the committee members.When this was brought to the Speaker&rsquo;s attention, he demanded that Chepkonga produce a report of the committee that adopted the changes &ndash; which he did not have.How Speaker Muturi went on to allow the matter to proceed without a report of the committee as required by the House rules remains unclear.
