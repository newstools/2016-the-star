The fuel tanker explosion and fireball on the Nairobi-Naivasha highway that killed 40 people on Saturday night was an accident that was long in the making. There were scenes of horror as motorists and passengers were incinerated inside their vehicles in the twinkling of an eye.In this age of pipelines and depots, the question will be asked why oil and gas are still transported by long haulage truck across such a tremendous distance as the length and breadth of Kenya. And what is the point of depots such as the ones at Eldoret, Nakuru and Kisumu if the bulk of fuel and gas continue to be carried long-distance by truck?What are the safety procedures for transporting particularly flammable oils and gases? Was the truck at Karai, for instance, clearly marked HIGHLY INFLAMMABLE?Accidents will happen but every precaution must be taken to save life and limb. Perhaps when the SGR is up and running it will take long haulage fuel trucks off our roads.
