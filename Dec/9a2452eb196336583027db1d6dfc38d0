President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Wednesday formally re-open Volkswagen&rsquo;s production line at Thika, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said.In a statement on Sunday, Esipisu said that the plant will see the first Volkswagen car assembled in Kenya since the last four decades.He said that the assembly line, at the Volkswagen facility inside the Kenya Vehicle Assembly (KVA), will deal with the VW Polo Vivo."It is now evident that the government has put in place the right policies that provide the right environment for the growth of industries," Esipisu said.He said that the Polo Vivo has only been produced in South Africa so far."It therefore makes sense for this model, and Volkswagen South Africa, to lead the expansion into Africa as VW plans to create a new region for the Group in Africa," Esipisu said."Part of the strategy is to develop affordable innovative financing packages with local banks that will expand the new market significantly," he said.Esipisu said the intention is to start operations on a small scale with the Polo Vivo before additional models such as the SUV Tiguan and the Passat are introduced. "Employees working on the Volkswagen line have been fully trained on the production system to ensure that the Kenyan VW vehicles will be of the same quality as other VW production plants around the world," he said. He said the country plays a prominent role within Africa, being the strongest economy in the EAC with a GDP of over US$69.2 billion (Sh7 trillion) as per 2015 estimates.State House further announced that the state has set aside Sh3 billion for the revival of Rift Valley Textile (Rivatex) factory in Eldoret."With a planned investment of Sh10 billion in the next three years, Rivatex will employ 2,000 to 2,500 direct jobs, with thousands of other auxiliary jobs expected in the pipeline," Esipisu said.Read: Donors plan Sh4 billion investment at RivatexEsipisu said the Rivatex investment was part of the governments plan to significantly lift its export to the US market under the favorable AGOA exports quota.This comes barely days after President Uhuru Kenyatta presided over the reopening of the Webuye Pan Paper Mills - now known as Rai Paper.More on this: Uhuru reopens Webuye Rai Paper during Western tour
