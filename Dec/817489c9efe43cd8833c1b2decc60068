LPK secretary general and political analyst David Makali says there is nothing wrong with both he and his brother running for office.His brother Bungoma speaker John Makali will run for Kanduyi MP. John will compete against incumbent Wafula Wamunyinyi who is the Ford Kenya Party chairman Bungoma branch. He will run on an ODM ticket.The two had previously sought family intervention to choose who should give up his political bid.The reasoning was that only one person &mdash; the one with the most clout &mdash; should run.Addressing a press conference in Bungoma town on Thursday, David said the Kanduyi people have been pressuring his brother to run for MP.&lsquo;&rsquo;If the people of Bungoma find us credible and suitable to lead them in the two positions, let them elect us because I have no doubt we are up to the task,&rsquo;&rsquo; he saidDavid said he believes Bungoma residents want him to replace Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula who is focussed on the presidency.He praised Wetang&rsquo;ula for his efforts to improve the county, but said he failed in some aspects.David accused Wetang&rsquo;ula of using his position as a stepping stone &ldquo;to aim for bigger things&rdquo; instead of concentrating at serving residents.LPK will hold rallies in Bungoma and Busia this weekend.&ldquo;There are many questions being asked about the political direction of Western and whether the people should join Cord or Jubilee or if therewill be the Nasa movement. We will discuss this during the tour.&rdquo; Graft, tribalism, unemployement and the high cost of living are major issues, he said.
