Muslim clerics in Mombasa and the Kenya Film Classification Board have rejected a proposal to lower the age of consent from 18 to 16.The Federation of Women Lawyers says the amendment to the Sexual Offences Act under The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment Bill) 2016, is meant to protect boys from being victimised by their girlfriends&rsquo; parents.However, KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua said the motive for introducing the amendment is suspicious and there is no excuse to lower the age for consensual sex.He said the legal age for one to qualify to be called an adult is 18, when one is deemed mature enough to make independent choices.&ldquo;It is okay to protect children but it is wrong to handle it from the perspective of this law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are procedures to take to protect the children and they are contained in the existing laws.&rdquo;Mutua spoke on Wednesday during a workshop with Muslim clerics to educate them on the KFCB mandate and a partnership with them at the Kenya School of Government in Mombasa.MaturityCouncil of Imams and Preachers of Kenya organising secretary Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa said though the Islamic religion allows girls under 18 years to be married, the law should be respected.&ldquo;Kenya is a secular nation, which operates under laws. The legal age is 18 and that should not change,&rdquo; he said.Bishop Jackson Kosgey said the age should not be the issue, but maturity.&ldquo;Sexuality has consequences, including reproductive capacity. Can the 16-year-old child carry a pregnancy? Is the 16-year-old boy ready to be a father in case it happens?&rdquo; said Kosgey, the KFCB chairman.He said the matter should be well-thought-out and consensus reached based on many factors.Fida chairperson Josephine Mong&rsquo;are, who led a team that drafted the amendments, said the proposed law has nothing to do with protecting predators.
