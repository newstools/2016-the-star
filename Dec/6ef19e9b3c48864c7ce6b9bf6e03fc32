There is increased tribalism in job distribution in institutions of higher learning, a report released yesterday indicates.The Ethnic and Diversity Audit of Public Universities in Kenya report shows that 66 per cent of total jobs in universities and constituent colleges are occupied by the six &lsquo;dominant&rsquo; communities. This leaves 44 per cent for the remaining ethnic groups. The six are Kalenjin, Kamba, Kikuyu, Kisii, Luhya and Luo, which dominate both top and subordinate positions in their respective areas of operations. The audit report, which was conducted by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, sampled 22 public universities and nine constituent colleges.During the launch in Nairobi yesterday, NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo said it is worrying that most public universities still employ staff based on tribe.
