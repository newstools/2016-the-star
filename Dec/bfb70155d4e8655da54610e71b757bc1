The Information Communication Authority will blacklist companies found selling fraudulent revenue systems to county governments. ICT authority CEO Robert Mugo said the vendors are a problem to counties, and are blocking the authority in its fight against fake ICT products. Mugo said the authority has received numerous complaints from county finance departments over the failure of the systems in revenue collection. People selling digitised systems are not only a problem to you,but also the authority as its hard to differentiate the real ones from the fake ones, Mugo said. He was speaking during the launch of the second county revenue automation conference in Mombasa. He said the authority is in the final stage of coming up with standard guidelines, which must be followed.
