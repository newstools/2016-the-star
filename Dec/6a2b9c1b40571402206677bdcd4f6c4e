Residents of Ruambwa sublocation have urged Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba and the CDF committee to turn the dormant Sh15 million Ruambwa-Mudembi grain depot into a health centre. Led by Michael Onyango, they said they usually walk long distances to seek medical services. The residents spoke on Thursday in Nadero village during a meeting convened by Namwamba&rsquo;s campaign team called &ldquo;Wamama Super&rdquo;. &ldquo;The grain depot built by the Budalang&rsquo;i CDF for grain storage is lying idle, since Ruambwa-Mudembi rice farmers have refused to utilise it, claiming it is far from the rice fields,&rdquo;Onyango said. &ldquo;Instead of the Sh15 million project going to waste, we are urging the MP and the CDF committee to turn the facility into a health centre.&rdquo; Resident Evelyn Sakwa said Namwamba should respond to their request, because expectant mothers suffer a lot when the time to deliver comes.
