Property valued at millions of shillings was destroyed after a fire incident at Kanu secretary general Nick Salat's home in Kericho on Thursday night.The fire that broke out at around 11pm is alleged to have been caused by an electrical fault.Salat and his family were not in at the time and no injuries were reported.Eye witnesses said the housekeeper managed to call neighbours who assisted in containing the fire."The fire would have blown up cars that were in the parking lot, including a Range Rover, but efforts from neighbours prevented this," the witness said.Fire fighters arrived at the scene an hour later.Kericho DCIO Julius Emase said they were investigating the incident to establish the cause.Emase said the house, which is located some seven kilometres from Kericho town, was undergoing renovations when the fire happened.Efforts to reach Salat on his mobile phone bore no fruit as his line went answered for the better part of Friday morning.Salat is just an immediate neighbor of Energy CS Charles Keter.Keter, Salat and a few prominent businesspeople in Kericho and Bomet counties bought the posh residential houses from Unilever Tea Kenya some 10 years back.Salat has in the past been "shopping for other partners" to merge with Kanu ahead of the 2017 general elections.In April, the Kanu secretary general said they were "still with Jubilee" but was "not ruling out the possibility of a coalition with Cord or other parties".More recently, he has been vocal about joining the National Super Alliance, which hopes to unseat the Jubilee administration next year.Read: NASA is a tribal outfit, says Uhuru
