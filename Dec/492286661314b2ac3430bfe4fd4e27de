Governor Jackson Mandago has put up a large digital TV screen in the centre of Eldoret town to market himself and broadcast the successes of his government.The screen was strategically placed at the Paradise junction on Uganda Road just before the Rio Olympics for live screening of the games, but it is now entirely used to market Mandago s achievements.In September, it was used to screen Mandago s homecoming live after he recorded statements at the DCI in Nairobi over alleged inciteful remarks he made at Moi University.Some of the advertisements on the screen describe Mandago as a listening governor and showcase the projects he has implemented in all six subcounties.While critics have questioned the cost of maintaining the large screen, which is on 24 hours a day, some residents say it is important the administration informs residents about its achievements. Many of us didn t know all that the county has done but through the large screen we have been able to see the initiatives and as we head to the next election we will be able to make informed decisions, political activist Joseph Chumba said yesterday.Some residents said the screen is simply a gimmick being used by Mandago to get a head start against his rivals.Mandago will seek reelection on the Jubilee Party ticket. His main rival Edward Serem is currently the Health chief officer in Nandi county.Serem is expected to resign in the next few weeks to concentrate on campaigns. He will also seek election on the JP ticket. The two will battle it out for votes from the non-Kalenjin communities in the region.Huruma MCA Peter Chomba and his Langas counterpart Francis Muya have called for inclusivity. They have accused Mandago of neglecting some residents.Uasin Gishu, which is also home to Deputy President William Ruto, has a huge population of Kikuyus, Luhyas, Luos and Kisiis, who could swing the vote and determine the outcome of the election.
