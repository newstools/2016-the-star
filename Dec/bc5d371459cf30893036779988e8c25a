A judge yesterday extended a temporary order suspending the supply of ballot papers as electoral commission accused opposition party Cord of employing delaying tactics.High Court judge George Odunga extended his earlier orders to remain in force until January 16 when the case filed by Cord is scheduled for hearing.Yesterday when the matter came up for mention the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission asked for its total dismissal terming it an incompetent case. Cord is challenging the awarding of Sh2.5 billion tender for supply of ballot papers on grounds that IEBC awarded it using a repealed law.However IEBC through its lawyer Anthony Lubulela accused Cord of politicizing and confusing court by introducing matters outside the process of public procurement mandate with effect of delaying the purchase of crucial election materials. This will cause great prejudice to the IEBC which is under strict legal timelines to prepare for the forthcoming general elections slated for August 8.Lubulela said the case by Cord is incompetent because it was filed outside the 14 day statutory period allowed for filling review of public procurement board decision.And once the 14 days lapsed, the court was told, the decision of the board became binding and final. The public procurement and disposal Act expressly provides that the procurement process ought not to be delayed beyond stipulated time.Secondly, IEBC says that the contract between Al Ghurair printing and publishing company and itself has already been signed and as such court cannot review it.It also argued that the case before court was brought by a party which did not submit any request for review or grievance before the procurement board.According to IEBC the opposition party came to court with unclean hands when it decided to conceal fact that it was not a substantive party to the case before procurement board. &ldquo;The applicant obtained ex-parte orders by concealing or suppressing important material facts namely that it was not a substantive party before the 2nd respondent and that its application is filed way out of the statutory limitation period,&rdquo; said IEBC in its grounds of objection filed in court.The case will be heard on January 16.
