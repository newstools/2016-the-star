Head coach Innocent Simiyu has said he is finalising plans for the Kenya Sevens team&rsquo;s psychologist and nutritionist.The two will be expected to take office by the start of next year, during the Wellington Sevens HSBC Series leg.Simiyu also intends to name a development coach to take charge of the Kenya Sevens &ldquo;B&rdquo; team.Upon his appointment, Simiyu was expected to name his technical bench to assist in running the team. An assistant is not a priority for the team at the moment. according to Simiyu.&ldquo;We are in the process of finalising the process of selecting a development coach in-charge of the &rdquo;B&rdquo; team come next year. &ldquo;Currently we have settled on the team psychologist and nutritionist. We will be releasing their names soon,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;As far as priority is concerned, we are at a time when we are focusing on setting standards as a team. The appointment of the assistant coach will come some time next year maybe between May and June,&rdquo;The coach said Shujaa, as the Kenya Sevens team is known, failed to convert most of their conversions especially during the Cape Town Cup quarterfinal match against New Zealand as well as in Dubai. Simiyu says he plans to seek the services of a kicking coach to improve the percentage of accuracy. &ldquo;Shujaa had a decent try scoring record but fell short when it came to making conversions,&rdquo; Simiyu said. Brian Tanga and Augustine Lugonzo were the kickers in the first two tournaments. Simiyu is yet to try out Darwin Mukidza, who was Kenya Simbas&rsquo; kicker last season.Shujaa played 11 matches, won five and lost six. Lugonzo managed 11 conversions while Tanga scored seven.&ldquo;Kicking is a skill, and as a result it can be up-skilled. We will be looking at getting a kicking coach to increase the percentage to about 75 per cent. Kicking has always been a problem historically but it can be up-skilled with proper training,&rdquo; he said. --
