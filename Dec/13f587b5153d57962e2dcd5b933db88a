The whole year used to be a countdown to the most important and exciting day of the year, the Village Christmas.Most families travelled to the village on Christmas eve. They would find celebrations already underway, the language barrier between Nairobi-raised grandchildren and their grandparents notwithstanding.EVERYBODY GOT ALONGJanet Gathu, who grew up in Ndumberi, Kiambu county, fondly remembers that everybody got along.On December 24 every year, Gathu and her many siblings would gather in their aunt&rsquo;s house, where they would sing one Christmas carol after another. The singing would start at around 8pm and go on until midnight to coincide with the birth of baby Jesus, as had been narrated to them time and time again in Sunday school.Earlier that day, they would have visited their local church, where they would see baby Jesus in a small wooden box littered with hay and a modest Christmas tree.The whole set-up would have cost nothing since all the items would have been donated by various church members from materials easily available in their homes.On this same night and from the safety of their home, they would hear youths blowing whistles and chanting Christmas songs, ushering in the all-important day in keeping with the zeal and zest for life that comes with being young.&ldquo;Every child loved Christmas because it was the only day that you were sure you would get to wear new clothes, eat chapati and drink soda,&rdquo; Gathu says. Gathu says that the new clothes would be bought at least one month to Christmas. &ldquo;It was usually nothing fancy but to a child who wore hand-me-downs from older siblings throughout the year, a new dress, white socks and plastic shoes or those tiny white pumps, it was just too exciting.&rdquo;The dress, she says, would be hidden in her mother&rsquo;s wardrobe, and it was only to be seen when she wore it on Christmas day.Gathu speaks nostalgically of climbing the neighbour&rsquo;s tree just for that one branch that would serve as the Christmas tree decorated with old ribbons saved from the previous celebrations.On the actual Christmas day, parents would religiously attend early mass so they would return home in time to make the much-anticipated chapati and stew, while the children would remain behind tidying up as the men ensured there was enough meat to feed everyone.&ldquo;I remember waking up very early in the morning to join my father, cousins and uncles in slaughtering the family goat. Just one goat was enough to feed an entire clan,&rdquo; James Muriithi says.This goat would have been selected from their grandfather&rsquo;s herd weeks before or bought through the contributions of the male relatives.&ldquo;We would buy a few crates of soda that would be hidden under my grandmother&rsquo;s bed to be distributed later,&rdquo; he adds.&ldquo;We brewed our own alcohol or muratina and that was all we needed to enjoy Christmas and to continue with the celebrations on Boxing Day,&rdquo; he expounds.FAMILY GET-TOGETHERThroughout these celebrations, Rev John Kiama says the community remained faithful to the true meaning of Christmas.&ldquo;It was a time for the family to get together and many travelled far and wide to gather in one place, preferably the home of their grandparents. Every member of the family was welcome,&rdquo; Kiama says.But that is no longer the case. He says that money has come between the traditional way of celebrating Christmas and how it is done today.The church itself has not been left behind, as many are not afraid of fundraising to buy the biggest Christmas tree at the local supermarket and the flashiest decorations.A homemade baby Jesus will not do. He, too, will be bought from gift shops, complete with Mother Mary and his father Joseph. And if baby Jesus has to have the best this Christmas, so does the congregation, who will all be in pursuit of the grandest Christmas that money can buy.ALL FLIGHTS LEAD TO MOMBASA&ldquo;December is the most expensive time to book a flight to the Coastal region, and not because of foreign but domestic tourists,&rdquo; says Muriithi, who works for a travel agency in Nairobi.&ldquo;The hotels to various out-of-town destinations will also be booked to capacity, and this is the most expensive period to make a hotel booking since it is the peak season,&rdquo; he says.As a result, the Christmas festive season has become the most expensive as people jostle to outdo each other on who will travel the farthest and to the most exotic destinations.Muriithi has eight siblings and in recent years, his elderly parents have had to celebrate Christmas all by themselves.The loud chatter, laughter and the smell of roasted meat no longer characterises this day, as each family member seeks out exotic ways to while away the day away from the larger family.&ldquo;There are now many people who have ventured into the tours and travel industry, and with the help of social media, there are many deals available to travel in and out of the country,&rdquo; Muriithi says.DUBAI A DREAM DESTINATIONDubai has become one of the most popular tourist destinations. &ldquo;Usually, people make bookings as a package. Travel and accommodation is pre-arranged for them. So this has made it easier for Kenyans to travel,&rdquo; Muriithi says.But this is not cheap, and various banking and lending institutions have already anticipated the need for money to finance the extravagant celebrations.From as early as January, many banks and saccos will have begun advertising various savings plans to finance the travels and expensive gifts that now characterise the Christmas period.&ldquo;Personally I have a check-off system with my bank. When my salary is deposited by my employer, Sh10,000 shillings goes into an account specifically meant for Christmas, and my husband does the same, so between us we have about Sh240,000 to enjoy with our three children,&rdquo; says Melissa Akinyi.Akinyi says that this year has been difficult and they were unable to raise the money, but last year, they travelled to Israel and the year before that to Dubai.&ldquo;The pressure is too much and the children are very disappointed since when they go back to school in January, they will not have something to report to their friends. It is really an issue of keeping up at all cost,&rdquo; Akinyi says.TAKING LOANS TO LIVE IT UPWhat&rsquo;s more, loans to finance this extravagant lifestyle are not off-limits. &ldquo;I work for a sacco and we receive so many loan applications towards the end of the year,&rdquo; she says.Social media will be littered with evidence of just how much celebrating Christmas has evolved from a much-anticipated family affair in the village, to a flashy spending spectacle. &ldquo;Now we buy big Christmas trees and place expensive gifts underneath. New clothes and chapati will not do this Christmas,&rdquo; she says.
