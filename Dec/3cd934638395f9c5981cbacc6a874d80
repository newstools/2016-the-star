An increasing number of graduates are entering the job market without adequate skills on the subjects they studied for. The growing trend points toward a widening gap between what employers want and what employees can offer. This gap is emanating from failure by the universities and students to offer and obtain, respectively, required training and skills during the academic trainingThere has been increased fears that majority of university graduates are &ldquo;half baked&rdquo; and lack adequate skills to match the academic certificates they hold and perform as per the expectations of employers.Various reasons have been cited for the widening skills gap including education system that puts more emphasis on holding highest formal academic qualifications than possessing necessary skills.Due to this, the number at which young people are joining youth polytechnics in Kiambu county has increased, with each student trying to fit in the modern market.A lot of jua kali apprentices are shown how to do different types of work, by those who are already working in the trade.However, things are not always smooth sailing. With the technology advancement in the world, a lot of machines and instruments have been improved while others computerised thus challenging the artisans.Joseph Waweru, a mechanic in Wangige town says he went back to a youth polytechnic to train in electrical engineering, after being challenged by automatic vehicles which are in the Kenyan market.He adds that he trained as a mechanic at the garage for one year, adding that he would not repair an automatic car alone.&ldquo;Whenever vehicles came to our garage, I would look for another mechanic so that we can team up and repair it. At one time we mixed wires and it developed an electrical short. It was a brand new car and the owner had to go another garage and he had paid us&rdquo; Waweru reveals.Waweru who later joined Kanyariri Polytechnic to do motor vehicle and electrical engineering in 2014, reveals that the experience taught him more than what he learnt while at the garage.Case studyKiambu county education chief officer Anne Gichohi says when area governor William Kabogo was campaigning in 2012, he promised residents that he would improve the quality of education offered by the youth polytechnics.When the government was set up, Gichohi said they visited all village polytechnics conducting research on what needed upgrading so that education offered would prepare students to adapt to market demands. She said they resolved to purchase modern equipment to ensure trainees are competent even with changing technology.&ldquo;Our research was based on courses offered, equipment used and the job market and the impact that would be left. We learnt we would add value on the courses if we offered courses that move with the current technology&rdquo; Gichohi said.Speaking at Kanyariri Polytechnic in Kabete constituency during the institution&rsquo;s graduation last month, Gichoni who was the chief guest said the move made the society have have faith in the genuity of the courses offered by polytechnics.Gichohi said county government bought the latest vehicle engines, knitting and sewing machines, computers, carpentry and building construction instruments for training.The chief officer also reveals that the government also renovated lecture rooms and workshops and built others in various polytechnics.She also revealed that the county government in partnership with Kenyatta University took the youth polytechnic through refresher courses to familiarise them with the modern equipment.Some of the 31 youth polytechnics in the county include Ngewa, Nyanduma, Kamirithu, Mang&rsquo;u, Gituamba, Juja Farm, Makongeni, Kanyoni, Kiganjo, Riuki among others.She reveals that, the number of students joining village polytechnic in the county has increased, since the society has realised that courses offered assist them to start their own businesses or may be employed in companies.Kanyariri Polytechnic principal Paul Mugwanja, said the institution used to enroll less than 20 students three years ago, but nowadays it admits more than 50 students.&ldquo;Out of those 20 students, some did not wait until they finished their course. They used to leave and secure casual jobs where they are trained as they worked&rdquo; Mugwanja says.&ldquo;This was because we relied on old engines that were bought in the 1970&rsquo;s for mechanics. For other courses like drawing and design, wiring and computer courses, we did theory due to lack of equipment&rdquo; he said.However, Mugwanja said the trend made polytechnics to lose society&rsquo;s confidence in the quality of education offered.Gichohi who was accompanied by the county director of youth and vocational training Emily Nkoroi, said a many polytechnics had increased their admission of students by 50 per cent due to the wide range of courses offered.These include mechanical and electrical engineering, tailoring, hairdressing and beauty, carpentry, building and construction, fashion drawing and design courses, all which require a boost of modern equipment.Nkoroi said the students must go for attachment when the institution closes to give them industrial experience, saying after graduation, they can start their own business or secure job opportunities with ease.A building and construction student Joseph Muchina says he has been in the field for 17 years, working as a casual labourer.He however reveals that, he had been trained to build houses using stones, and had worked on different sites. However, one day he was contracted to build a house in Ngecha village but it collapsed when he was almost finishing it. He had overlooked several important aspects and this prompted him to go back to school to learn.Governor Kabogo has urged the young people graduating from polytechnics to borrow soft loans to start businesses instead of wasting time searching for employment.&ldquo;Those who come from the same area should seek business loans from our own Biashara Fund kitty or any other money lending institution that attracts little repay interest. They know each other well. They can repay it and keep applying for additional top-ups to boost their businesses&rdquo; the governor said.Kabogo says his vision is seeing young people busy building the nation and lacking time to engage themselves in alcoholism, drug abuse or engage in illegal gangs.The move to upgrade polytechnic and technical training education by county and national governments is aimed at improving the quality of products made in the country.It was started by former President Mwai Kibaki when he upgraded Kenya and Mombasa polytechnics to be Technical University of Kenya and Technical University of Mombasa.
