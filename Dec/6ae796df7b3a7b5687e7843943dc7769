City Hall expects to rake in billions of shillings from ongoing regularisation of buildings and plots if owners comply.The deadline is February next year.Some owners have no title deeds, some developers are balky or refuse to pay. The drive targets about 50,000 buildings constructed without approval and irregular amalgamations, subdivisions and change of land use.Among the targets are Tassia, which has about 5,500 unapproved plots, Nasra with about 1,000, Pipeline with 2,000 and Donholm with 2,000.In total, these estates have about 10,500 plots with unapproved developments. With an average approval fee of Sh200,000 per plot, the county will collect more than Sh2 billion. According to the Regularisation Progress Report released on Monday, the county has collected Sh22.3 million from 131 developments it has regularised since the programme started in March.They include 116 buildings, five amalgamations or subdivisions and 10 applications for change of use or extension of use. The confidential report shows that land-buying companies and private developers have submitted 234 applications to regularise status.However, mistrust and disputes in some land companies are slowing progress. Some members are not organised as groups. Some developers are neither willing to engage consultants nor pay the NCC fee, it reads.It recommends continuous and vigorous awareness campaign involving county staff, developers and others. Lack of awareness is slowing regularisation..The Nairobi City County Regularisation of Development Act offers a window of six months for developers who built without getting permits.In September last year, Governor Evans Kidero said there were about 50,000 unapproved buildings, some of them high-rise structures, especially in Eastlands.
