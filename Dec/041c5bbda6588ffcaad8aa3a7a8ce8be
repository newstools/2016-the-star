At Engage, fascinating thinkers and doers combine to spark discussion and connect with the audience on various topics. The Christmas edition was held last Saturday at the Braeburn Theatre on Gitanga road, Nairobi. Among the guest speakers were columnist Oyunga Pala, management consultant Carol Musyoka, copywriter Aleya Kassam and artist Chief Nyamweya. The bimonthly Engage platform focuses on the power of engagement to foster learning and transform minds and lives. It also provides an opportunity for talented artistes to showcase their skill and entertain the audience.
