Politicians reviving clanism in Mbeere risk death for violating a 2011 vow that stopped the trend, Mbeere Anglican Church leaders have said.Anyone who tries to revive clanism will be cursed and the curse will follow him and his lineage for 300 years, Bishop Moses Masamba (pictured) said.He said clanism used to cause conflicts, disharmony, insecurity and underdevelopment.Various leaders, including politicians and clerics, resolved to get rid of it and an elaborate Christian ceremony was organised at the Good Samaritan ACK Church Nyangwa on December 12, 2011, the cleric said.Masamba said during the ceremony elders from the two major Ndamata and Murure clans and church leaders prayed devotedly and swore that never again shall anyone divide the Mbeere community along clan lines.A curse was then invoked on anyone who would revive clanism, he said.
