In any sporting contest, you know that you have a problem on your hands when the event starts with a prolonged argument over who is &ndash; and who is not &ndash; qualified to be the referee.And yet, politically speaking, that is where we are now. It would seem that our most influential political players cannot agree on who is to audit the voters&rsquo; lists; what electronic devices are to be used to record the actual votes; or who should serve as the commissioners of the IEBC.In some ways, this is not a particularly special problem. Right now in the US, there is a bitter debate taking place on their unique institution of the &ldquo;electoral college&rdquo;, a collection of &ldquo;electors&rdquo; from the various states, who are (oddly enough) the ones who get to cast the decisive vote that determines who will be president.One camp in the US argues that there is no reason to change a system that has worked admirably for over 200 years.The other camp argues that the US founding fathers set up the electoral college to create a 'last line of defence' against populist tyranny, and that the electors must vote their conscience and support some other Republican instead of president-elect Donald Trump.The difference between Kenya and the US, then, is that we are quarrelling over the presidential election before it takes place (primarily because we are no strangers to clumsily rigged presidential elections), while in the US the debate only began after Trump's upset victory.Looking at the Kenyan scenario though, there is really just one important thing that we should keep in focus: This is that all these suspicions from both sides of the deep political cleavage that we face at the present are well justified.Consider any top political figure said to have a &ldquo;fanatical following&rdquo; in his regional &ldquo;political backyard&rdquo; and you will find that in past elections, there was an implausibly high turnout of voters in that region.Then we have also seen the deeply flawed party nominations that very often leave out the truly popular candidates and witness the elevation of unknown men and women. In short, everybody rigs, as and when they can. With the main difference being that the governing political coalition can usually add hundreds of thousands &ndash; if not millions &ndash; of votes to the eventual tally of the political establishment&rsquo;s candidate.
