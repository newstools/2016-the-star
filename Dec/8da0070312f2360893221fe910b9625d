President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said his administration will continue initiating projects equitably.He said the Jubilee administration exists to serve all Kenyans and no one should claim it is favouring any part of this country. Uhuru emphasised that Jubilee espouses an all-inclusive approach to development that ensures no region is marginalised.&ldquo;Kenyans want their lives improved and that cannot be achieved through divisive politics and discrimination,&rdquo; he said.The President said his administration is focused on lifting the lives of citizens, citing the example of the countrywide connection of 5.3 million households to electricity compared to only 2.2 million that enjoyed the facility before he assumed office in 2013.Uhuru spoke when he launched the upgrading to bitumen standards of the 192-kilometre road, which runs from Kibwezi through Ikutha, Mutomo, Kitui town, Kabati to Migwani, for Sh18.4 billion.&ldquo;Before we came into office, only 7,000 Kitui South households had electricity. Today, more than 22,000 households are connected to power. Those are the developments Jubilee stands for,&rdquo; he said, adding that upgrading of the road fulfills one of the government&rsquo;s socioeconomic goals for the region.Uhuru called it &ldquo;a major artery&rdquo; that will open up Kitui, Makueni and Machakos for rapid development.
