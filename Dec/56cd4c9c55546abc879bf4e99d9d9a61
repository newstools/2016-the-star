Nairobi Jubilee MCAs yesterday urged Cord leader Raila Odinga to condemn &ldquo;rampant corruption at City Hall&rdquo;.They said Raila has been silent on corruption at City Hall because Nairobi county is under a Cord governor. &ldquo;When Jubilee steals, the Auditor General unearths the theft. When Cord steals, he exposes them. Raila should condemn corruption at City Hall,&rdquo; Ngara MCA Mwaura Chege said.A report by the Auditor General shows Nairobi lost Sh20 billion in 2014-15. The ward representatives said the loss should be investigated swiftly and urgently. &ldquo;We request the county assembly speaker to call for a special sitting to discuss the audit issues,&rdquo; minority leader Abdi Guyo said. The MCAs urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to invoke Article 192(b) of the Constitution and suspend the county government.Governor Evans Kidero yesterday said, however, there is no way the county could have lost Sh20 billion from a budget &ldquo;that was slightly above Sh20 billion&rdquo;.
