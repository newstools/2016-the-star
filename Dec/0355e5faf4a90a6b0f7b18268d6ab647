Hoteliers at the Coast have accused low-cost carrier Jambojet of &ldquo;dumping passengers&rdquo; midway their journeys and delaying flights. Through their lobby group &ndash; the Kenya Coast Tourism Association &ndash; the hoteliers said the carrier has been dumping passengers destined for Ukunda and Malindi at the Moi International Airport (Mombasa).&ldquo;Passengers heading to Ukunda chose a direct flight to avoid the pain at the ferry, and you go ahead to subject them to the same pain again without any qualms. Why don&rsquo;t you just sell what you can handle instead of giving a false promise of having the capacity to land in Ukunda or Malindi,&rdquo; KCTA chairman Mohammed Hersi (pictured) said. He said the inconveniences are hurting domestic tourism , a blow to hotels. However, Jambojet said it has had &ldquo;unexpected technical challenges&rdquo; on its fleet that operates most of its coastal routes.&ldquo;Additionally, the delivery of our newly leased aircrafts initially schedules for introduction during the peak season was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, and will only be delivered in early 2017,&rdquo; the management said in a statement yesterday. This, it said, has forced the carrier to reschedule flights and carry passengers on smaller aircrafts, while re-routing others via Mombasa using Kenya Airways flights. &ldquo;We apologise to all concerned for the unpleasant nature of this entire experience and we will resolve the issue,&rdquo; the management said.
