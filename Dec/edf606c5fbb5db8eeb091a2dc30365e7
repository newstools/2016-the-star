A Kikuyu spokesman in Eldoret will be crowned in a ceremony today, despite wrangling among community leaders.Deputy county commissioner John Kinjo said the elders had applied for a permit to host the event and no one had opposed it. I have seen their application to hold the ceremony and we have no reason to stop it, Kinjo told the Star on the phone yesterday.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and a section of the elders from the community had demanded the ceremony be postponed until after the general election. They said it would destabilise regional politics.Joseph Mwaura, the coordinator of the elders, said they will proceed with the ceremony because it posed no security threat in the region, and theyalready acquired a licence. We will go on with our plans. The ceremony will go on as planned, Mwaura said. Huruma MCA Peter Chomba, who supports the event, said it should proceed without interference.Mandago last week said the meeting should be stopped after it sparked a row among Kikuyu community political leaders wrangling over the election.Mandago had said the leaders should agree before the ceremony gets a go-ahead. We are not opposed to the event but we feel the elders and the community should agree and move together, Mandago said.Deputy President William Ruto is invited to the ceremony at the 64 Stadium.A group led by businessman Joseph Wainaina also wants the installation cancelled. They oppose the other faction led by Chomba and Francis Muya(Langas) which has supported the coronation. Gema national organising secretary Paul Kinyanjui said they are also opposed to the installation. We do not see the need for such a ceremony, especially at this time when the country is headed for elections.We can t do it without agreeing and working with other communities for peace and cohesion, Kinyanjui said.
