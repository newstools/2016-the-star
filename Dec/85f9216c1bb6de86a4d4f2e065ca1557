Some Kenya Police Service officers have threatened to stage a go-slow after not finding their names in the list of those promoted. The list was submitted to Inspector General Joseph Boinnet (pictured) by the National Police Service Commission. The officers are in the rank of superintendents. One of the officers, who sought anonymity, on Sunday told the Star many female officers were locked out in the promotions, despite having been vetted by the Johnston Kavuludi-led NPSC and passing the test. The officer said 120 APs were promoted and only 60 KPS officers were promoted, including five females. The officer said the list was released last week. &ldquo;We are frustrated, given the fact that a lot of officers and the general public have trust and faith in the NPSC and the police management,&rdquo; the officer said. The officer said they have been working as acting superintendents. Efforts to contact the NPSC officials were unsuccessful, as our calls went unanswered.
