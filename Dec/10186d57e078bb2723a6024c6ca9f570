President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday urged the Kamba community to ditch Wiper for Jubilee.They told residents the Jubilee administration is committed to serving every citizen. The two addressed a rally in Kibwezi town, Makueni county.&ldquo;Come we reason together, we walk together so we solve the problems of our people together,&rdquo; Uhuru said. &ldquo;There will never be tribal development, my government is committed to creating wealth and creating job opportunities for our youth.&rdquo;The rally was attended by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and his Machakos counterpart Alfred Mutua.Ruto dismissed leaders who have been claiming they pushed for the construction of the Kibwezi-Kitui road. He said debate on who agitated for the tarmacking of the road is a non-issue. &ldquo;Our interest is not in who requested for the road project, but in undertaking the project to transform this area,&rdquo; Ruto said.He told the Kamba community the opposition lacks direction, hence the need for them to join JP. &ldquo;This time don&rsquo;t join a camp that is unsure of where it is taking you. We must form the government with you after the 2017 election,&rdquo; the DP said.Earlier, Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu, who was in charge of the programme, paraded Wiper defectors Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni), John Munuve (Mwingi North), Richard Makenga (Kaiti), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Itwiku Mbai (Masinga), Francis Mwangangi ( Yatta) and Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South), whom he said had joined Jubilee.Mutambu said the community has been misused for a long time and this is the right time for it to &ldquo;go back to the government&rdquo;.&ldquo;Mr President, the purpose of this rally is to show you the community has decided not to be left out as you form the government in 2017,&rdquo; he said.But Kibwezi East MP Jessica Mbalu said they are firmly in Cord.
