Baringo senator Gideon's Moi's Christmas and New Year message mounted on a billboard in Kabarnet town has elicited mixed reactions from residents.The two-sided bill board, according to Senator Moi's personal assistant Peter Chelanga, was to publicly reach out to the masses with the well wishes during the festive season."Instead of printing and circulating to the people small cards which could become more expensive, we decided to hire the strategic billboard," Chelanga told the Star on Tuesday.Clement Keitany, a resident of Kabarnet town, estimated that the billboard may cost Sh20,000 per month."Although we do not know how long it will be put up there, the senator should have used the money as a Christmas gift to the poor and the less fortunate people in the county," he said.Keitany further said that the Senator was only out to outsmart his opponents in the 2017 general election, adding that the lot could equally afford to buy such advertisement space but chose social media and smaller Christmas cards."He is not the only leader in the entire North Rift region who can afford such an expensive media to wish people merry Christmas," he said.Other residents said they have no problem with the billboard as long as the county earned revenue from the same.For long, billboards have been associated with well established corporates which advertise their products.The billboard has a message of 'Mambo Bado' (not yet), which has been perceived as a warning to Kanu rivals of a tough battle during the August 8 vote.Read: 'Selfish' Ruto is pushing 2022 presidency at expense of unity - Gideon Moi
