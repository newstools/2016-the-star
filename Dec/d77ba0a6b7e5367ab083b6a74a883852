Kenya Cup champions Kabras Sugar face former champions Kenya Commercial Bank in a &lsquo;Battle of the Titans&rsquo; as the league enters its Match Day 5 at the Kakamega Show ground today (4:00pm kick-off).The match will be a repeat of the 2014/15 Kenya Cup final and the 2015/16 Enterprise Cup final, where on both occasions, the bankers emerged winners. At the same stage last season, the bankers beat Kabras 40-15 at the Den. The bankers will, however, miss the services of their fullback and kicker Darwin Mukidza, who is away on national duty and Davis Chenge, who is committed. Kabras on the other hand, are minus Brian Tanga, who is away in Dubai playing for Shujaa.KCB team manager Ronnie Kang&rsquo;eta has not made any major changes in the team. He plans to maintain the same team, blending youth and experienced players&mdash; a move that worked perfectly for him when they mauled Kabras in Enterprise Cup final this year. &ldquo;We will stick to our game plan but once in a while, we will use some of the new set pieces. Kabras is a tough team to beat but we have done it before and I hope the players will give their best and we can do it again,&rdquo; said Kang&rsquo;etaThe other derby of the day pits SportPesa Quin against Resolution Impala Saracens in a Ngong&rsquo; Road affair at Impala ground. The two sides last met during the Impala Floodlit semi-final, where the hosts won 13-11.
