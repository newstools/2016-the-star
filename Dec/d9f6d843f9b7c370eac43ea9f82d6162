At least 30 people drowned after a boat carrying a football team and their fans capsized on Lake Albert in Uganda, police said on Monday. The overcrowded vessel was carrying some 45 people. Police say the boat became unbalanced when too many passengers moved to one side. Nine bodies have been recovered, and 15 people have been rescued, reports say. Boat accidents are fairly common on Lake Albert and in other parts of Africa.Read: 98 die in Lake Albert boat accident - UNVessels are often packed with too many people and goods, and in a poor state.
