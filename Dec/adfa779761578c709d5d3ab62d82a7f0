One hundred and twenty-seven traffic officers have been fired from the National Police Service after failing the vetting process.NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi said the officers were dismissed over unexplained financial transactions, including sending and receiving money from fellow police officers in the traffic department and operating matatu businesses.Other reasons include receiving money from transporters and operators of breakdown businesses, and professional misconduct.The commission dismissed 36 officers from Coast, 23 from Western, 50 from Rift Valley and 18 from Nyanza.Read: Senior traffic cops panic as vetting panel demand answers on huge MPesa transactionsAlso read: Three out of every ten traffic officers in Mombasa, Kisumu to be firedKavuludi said on Tuesday said of the 904 officers vetted, 72 are pending investigations before the vetting results, while 26 were removed after opting not to be interviewed."Unlike previously when only an average 4 per cent of officers vetted were found to be unsuitable, this time the number has shot up to 14 per cent,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Sufficient mechanisms have been put in place by the service to monitor officers who have been removed from the service to ensure they remain law abiding citizens,&rdquo; he added.Kavuludi also said the Traffic department has been devolved to facilitate closer supervision by county commanders.&ldquo;The lessons learnt through the process of vetting have been very instrumental in the recent reorganisation of the traffic department,&rdquo; he said.He said that 20 officers who had been previously fired and applied for vetting review had been reinstated after passing the process.They include Masoud Mwinyi, William Meto, William Kariuki Ngugi, Japheth Ngwata, Chacha Daniel Chacha and Festus Malinge Luruma.Twelve others failed the vetting review, one applied to retire and one more is awaiting the conclusion of a court case that she has filed against the commission.Kavuludi said vetting will continue in other parts of the country, namely Kajiado, Nairobi, Central, Eastern and North Eastern regions.
