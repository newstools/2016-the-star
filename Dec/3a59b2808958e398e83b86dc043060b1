Ford Kenya has fired rebel officials who were part of a group that had allegedly been attempting to remove party leader Moses Wetang'ula.The party has also proposed to amend its constitution so that Wetang'ula can have powers to appoint chairmen to oversee county and constituency affairs.Most of Ford Kenya's branch chairmen had declared support for the rebel camp.The faction was headed by Trans Nzoia Senator aspirant Ken Wafula, Nairobi chairman Komesa Lupesia and national organising secretary Peter Munyae.The three no longer have roles in the party headed by Wetang'ula who is also Bungoma Senator.But Wafula said: We have looked at the resolutions passed at an illegal governing council meeting, hosted by Wetang'ula, at Bomas of Kenya a week ago. He wants all other branch officials appointed so that they can be sycophants."The politician said they had written a petition for the registrar of political parties to block amendments to the party constitution, a move which he said would wreck Ford Kenya.Wafula s bid to host a parallel National Governing Council meeting in Thika flopped after he was served with a court order stopping it. The meeting was to announce Wetangula s removal. The rebel group has announced plans to hold grassroots polls in the new year to elect new Ford Kenya officials.The Bomas meeting endorsed Wetang'ula as the party s presidential candidate. In the changes it proposed, the governing council will be given full powers to nominate the presidential candidate.But Wafula s group argued in its petition that only a special delegates conference, attended by at least 5,000 members, can make such a decision.The politician added that the party's constitution states that the NGC meeting is strictly to be attended by party officials.He said the Bomas meeting had "strangers" including Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Siaya Senator James Orengo, whose presence he said rendered the meeting illegal.Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi said the rebel group led by Wafula was being used by rivals to cripple Ford Kenya. We don t need such characters in the party. They are political mercenaries for hire and cannot have a vision for anything," he said.Wanyonyi added that the Bomas meeting made key resolutions that will strengthen the party ahead of the 2017 general election.Lupesia who claims to have been abducted and tortured while on his way to the Thika meeting, said they would fight on to streamline Ford Kenya.
