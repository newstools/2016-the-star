Some unscrupulous heads of national schools sell slots meant for bright students from poor backgrounds, Ahadi Kenya CEO Stanley Kamau has said.&ldquo;The head teachers sometimes take advantage of the [students&rsquo;] poor families and failure to get money on time to report to the schools they have been posted to and sell their slots,&rdquo; he said.Kamau spoke at Mvumoni, Kwale county, after distributing food on Saturday under the &lsquo;Chakula kwa Wote&rsquo; initiative. Ahadi Kenya has partnered with the Lotto Foundation for the initiative.The programme targets to reach 10,000 families in all the 47 counties during the festive season. &ldquo;Today we have reached 7,000 families in Kwale. We will proceed to Migori, West Pokot and Nairobi in the coming week,&rdquo; Kamau said. He urged governors and MPs who sponsor students through bursaries to pay for their fees through to form four or through university. &ldquo;We should not only offer sponsorship for children only for one term or one year but sponsor them throughout their secondary or university education,&rdquo; Kamau said.
