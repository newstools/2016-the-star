Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga on Tuesday met his critic Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo in a closed-door meeting at Joe Donde&rsquo;s home in Gem.They mended fences ahead of the general election.The meeting was convened by former Gem MP and the current Siaya county public service board chairman Donde. It has left many guessing what decisions may have been made.Pictures taken after the meeting suggest the two may have agreed to work together.Unconfirmed reports indicate ODM leader Raila Odinga joined the meeting midway but his input was still unknown.However, our mole told us the meeting was to convince Midiwo, a fierce critic of Rasanga, to support his bid as governor and tame any political friction in Siaya.This comes barely a day after Midiwo endorsed Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo and businessman William Oduol as his preferred Siaya governor aspirants. The move is seen by many as rare and one of a kind. It has left Oduol and Gumbo&rsquo;s supporters in disbelief.Of interest is to see Midiwo dance to the tune of &lsquo;Rasanga tena&rsquo; after three years of fierce criticism.Raila on Sunday urged Nyanza leaders to observe sanity during the campaigns for the sake of his presidential bid. He said fighting for positions in his own backyard will scuttle his bid inside and outsside Nyanza.On Wednesday, Rasanga echoed Raila&rsquo;s sentiments by advocating for peaceful campaigns.He exuded confidence that no political realignment in Siaya will scuttle his reelection bid and welcomed all those who wish to vie for the position.The governor added that he predicted the Gumbo-Oduol coalition even before the two started plotting with the aim of unseating him.
