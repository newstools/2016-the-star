Education CS Fred Matiang'i has been fronted as the interim IEBC chairman for overseeing the most credible KCPE and KCSE exams.Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto said the CS should be mandated with overseeing next year's election which will take place on August 8, 2017.Rutto said the poll will not be free and fair unless the team chaired by Isaack Hassan is replaced with an interim team headed by Matiang'i.The Select Panel has already shortlisted five lawyers to replace outgoing IEBC chairman Issack Hassan.The panel chaired by Bernadette Musundi shortlisted former Mombasa mayor Taib Ali Taib and four others to be interviewed on December 19.Florence Mwangangi, lawyers Wanyonyi Chebukati, Tukero ole Kina and Lucas Naikuni were shortlisted from a list of 35 applicants."IEBC's reputation has been tainted over cases of corruption and rampant rigging of elections. Allowing the same team to remain in office over the lame excuse of lack of better candidates does not hold water," Rutto said at the weekend.He underlined that the credible exams were a reflection of what Matiang'i would achieve if appointed to head the electoral body.See: [VIDEO] Sossion shocked as Matiang'i releases KCPE results todayRead: CS Matiang&rsquo;i reforms curb KCPE cheatingThe Governor also asked the government to ensure peaceful elections and avoid incidents where police intimidate those challenging "favoured government candidates".Rutto cited the incident in Silibwet stadium in Bomet where an officer lobbed a teargas canister at him forcing him to seek medical attention in South Africa."Insults and vulgar language against unfavoured candidates were dominant in political campaigns in 2013 and were used to silence those seen as strong challengers," he added."This is not the kind of intimidation Kenyans should be subjected to as the Jubilee government tries to silence its critics."He said the best leaders should be allowed victories while losers should concede.The new electoral law has created a fresh crisis at the electoral agency and preparations for the election are beginning to seem like a mission impossible.The law sets new and rigid requirements and shorter timelines, effectively messing up the calendar for the poll and indicating that deadlines will be missed.IEBC had drawn up its 2017 roadmap, the elections operations plan, but the commission must revise timelines to conform to electoral law amendments enacted by Parliament last month.More on this: [VIDEO] IEBC secret memo sparks fears over 2017 pollAlso read: Auditor general pokes more holes on IEBC 2013 payments
