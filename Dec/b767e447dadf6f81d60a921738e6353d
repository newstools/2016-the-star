Baringo residents demonstrated on Wednesday in a call for NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri to help them evict land grabbers in Kabarnet town.They said Swazuri gave the land grabbers a week to leave when he visited five months ago, but that they were yet to.Led by civil society crusader Isaiah Biwott, the protesters told the media that most of the culprits were prominent politicians who were speedily taking over the town.Among those they named as owners of property allegedly grabbed were Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita and former president Daniel Moi's political aide Joshua Kulei.Others were Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, former Kabarnet Mayor the late Philemon Chelagat and Kenya Power director Susan Chesina who wants to be a woman representative.&ldquo;They have even fenced off the CBD of the town formerly possessed by the defunct municipal council. But no action has been taken... They have neither been warned nor arrested," said Biwott.He noted this was happening under the watch of the county and national governments.Aspirants for the Mwaita's seat in the 2017 election have linked him to the upsurge in land grabbing cases in the county, including public utilities, at the time he was serving as Commissioner for lands in the Moi regime.Read more: Race to unseat MP Mwaita attracts 7The residents chanted 'haki yetu (our rights)' and 'serikali saidia (government, help)' in their march to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta.They said the land grabbers had slowed development in the town and were also fencing off water catchment area.&ldquo;We fear River Kiberenege near Kabarnet hospital might soon dry up if an unidentified land grabber fells down indigenous trees around Rift Hills hotel and the county commissioner&rsquo;s offices,&rdquo; said the crusader.He noted the river serves more than 2,000 residents of Kaprogonya estate.Biwott, who led the demonstration alongside environmental activist Gilbert Kiptalam, asked Swazuri for quick action. He said they will pull down the abandoned chain-link fences within the town if a solution is not found.On April 14, Swazuri gave grabbers of public land in Kabarnet town and the rest of the county two weeks to leave, saying they would be forcefully evicted.He issued more than 50 illegal plot owners with eviction notices during his two-day meeting on International Dialogue on Land and Security (IDLS).More than 300 people living on the piece of land owned by the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) land in Kabarnet town are among those affected.Swazuri said land surveyors were satisfied with the findings that the land grabbers hived off 7.3ha belonging to the cereals board that initially had a total of 11ha.The chairman said the eviction would help counties land management boards address recurrent land issues.&ldquo;It has come to our attention that some counties cannot even acquire land to construct their offices and staff houses as grabbers dominate," he said, adding the matter had worsened.Swazuri said the problem stemmed from unscrupulous land deals carried out under the defunct county government&ldquo;A thief remains a thief whether holding supporting documents or not. There are no negotations where public land is concerned," he said.Efforts to reach the accused were futile as their phones went unanswered.Kins of the deceased were also not available to express their family views over the allegations.
