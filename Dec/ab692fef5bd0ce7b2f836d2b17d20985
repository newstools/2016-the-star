Kitui Governor Julius Malombe and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu clashed on Saturday over the Friday crushing to death of former Kitui Mayor Martha Mwangangi by a county fire engine.The two came face-to-face at Mwangangi&rsquo;s home in Mwembe Tayari village on the outskirts of Kitui town, where they had gone to condole with the family.Ngilu, who seeks to unseat Malombe, told the governor to his face he should take full responsibility for Mwangangi&rsquo;s death. She was addressing the mourners soon after Malombe delivered his condolences.&ldquo;Since Mwangangi was killed by a county government truck, the governor must take full responsibility because he is the head of the institution,&rdquo; Ngilu said. But Malombe interjected, asking Ngilu to stop imputing that he had anything to do with the death.Undeterred, Ngilu said the knocking down to death of Mwangangi, who accompanied her during a demonstration over the demolition of hawkers&rsquo; kiosks by county officers, was outright murder. &ldquo;It was not an accident but murder. I was with her and witnessed first-hand what happened,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We cannot allow the perpetration of killings by people who want to remain in office.&rdquo; Malombe said Ngilu was making a serious mistake by drawing hasty conclusions on Mwangangi&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;As much as she was your friend, the late Martha was a person we knew and was close to us. We are all mourning. Please allow full investigations, not by you as Ngilu or myself, but by the police,&rdquo; he said.After the exchange, Malombe and several executives left. He said thorough investigations will be carried out. Addressing the press in Ithookwe showground earlier on Saturday, Malombe said politicians should not take advantage of the death to revamp their fading political careers.
