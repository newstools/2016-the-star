The race to unseat Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has intensified eight months to the election.The governor&rsquo;s top political rival is former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati, who is said to have gained massive support of the Sudi region. Sudi is the southern part of Bungoma county, named after pre-colonial paramount chief Sudi Namachanja. The area includes Bumula and Kanduyi constituencies.On Sunday, Khang&rsquo;ati met 300 opinion leaders from Kanduyi and Bumula constituencies in Bungoma town, where they pledged to support his bid.The leaders accused Lusaka of doing little with the more than Sh30 billion the county has received since 2013.In July, Lusaka defended his development record, saying all nine constituencies county have developed and &ldquo;those with eyes can see it.&rdquo; Two Infotrak polls have placed his county second after Machakos, he said.
