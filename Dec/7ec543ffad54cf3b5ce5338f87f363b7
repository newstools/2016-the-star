The Busia government has donated 35 dairy cows and 3,000 goats to farmers. Agriculture executive Moses Osia said the cows have been donated to 35 farmers&rsquo; groups. He addressed farmers on Thursday during the handover at the Busia Agricultural Training Centre. The event was attended by Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa. Osia said one member of the group will keep the pregnant animal until it delivers. He will then keep the calf and hand over the animal to the next member and so on. The project started in 2015, when 35 dairy cows were donated to specific groups in the 35 wards. &ldquo;Our target is to make Busia produce more milk from the current 6.5 litres per cow per day to 10 litres per cow per day,&rdquo; Osia said. He said Artificial Insemination has been made available at &ldquo;a reasonable price of not more than Sh1,000 down from Sh4,000 per insemination&rdquo;. Deputy Governor Wangalwa urged farmers to form groups and buy tractors to improve farming and produce more food.
