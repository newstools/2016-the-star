Security at the Likoni Crossing Channel will be upgraded for Sh500 million, the government said on Wednesday.Transport PS Irungu Nyakera said Sh100 million will be disbursed in this financial year and Sh400 million in the next financial year.The Likoni channel is used by about 300,000 commuters and 6,000 motorists daily. It is an easy target for criminal attacks.Currently, the channel has security scanners to screen passengers boarding the ferry. There are also private security guards, bouncers and two officers aboard the ferries on each trip. There is a 24-hour manned police post on both sides of the channel &mdash; the Island and the mainland.Nyakera spoke during the re-launch of the MV Harambee, which had been out of service for almost a year. He said security at the Likoni channel is paramount.&ldquo;We believe security at the channel is critical, because if something happens, God forbid, we will not have a channel to talk about. We have, therefore, budgeted for an additional Sh400 million for security,&rdquo; Nyakera said. The PS added that the government will construct a multi-level parking for motorists and commuters.The commuters currently are crowded at the waiting bay, which lacks adequate seating to accommodate the huge number of residents.Nyakera said a modern waiting bay will allow the commuters to sit and queue comfortably as they wait for the next ferry. &ldquo;We are still working on the budget for construction of the multi-level parking,&rdquo; he said.In 2013-14, Mombasa was prone to terror attacks targeting crowded places. However, no incident was reported at the Likoni channel.Police officers, Kenya Ferry Services management and the National Intelligence Services have been on the lookout for suspicious characters.During the holidays and public functions, the Kenya Navy soldiers from Mtongwe Naval Base are deployed on the channel to ensure maximum security.There is also a police patrol boat that is usually seen patrolling the channel at different times of the day.
