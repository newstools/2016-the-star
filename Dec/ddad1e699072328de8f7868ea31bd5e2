Two Garissa legislator hopefuls have dismissed the recent meeting by top leaders to discuss how to share seats among the three major clans.They are senator hopeful Aden Sugow and Garissa Township aspirant Abdi Yare. They urged residents to be wary of politicians who use clans to advance their political ambitions.Sugow met elders in Garissa town yesterday to seek their endorsement. He said, &ldquo;My sub-clan has already fielded candidates for senator and woman representative. Why would some elders sit in Nairobi and make a different agreement?&rdquo;Last Friday, elders, religious and political leaders and business people from the Samawathal and Abduwak clans met in Nairobi and endorsed Ali Korane for governor, incumbent Yussuf Haji for senator, and Anab Subow for woman representative.Sugow said &lsquo;tribal marriages&rsquo; lead to graft and inefficiency, because &ldquo;the people chosen using the arrangement have no mandate from the people.&rdquo;He urged residents to reject the Nairobi group.Yare warned Haji and Korane against &ldquo;meddling&rdquo; in Garissa Township&rsquo;s politics.He said imposing candidates will lead to discontent and unrest.
