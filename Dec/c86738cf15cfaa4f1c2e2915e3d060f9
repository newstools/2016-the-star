Umbrella workers&rsquo; union Cotu has rejected suggestions for it to support the ruling Jubilee or any other party in the 2017 general election.Secretary general Francis Atwoli spoke following remarks by Dock Workers&rsquo; Union secretary general Simon Sang that it will support Jubilee and also convinceCotu to support the cause.Sang said he would rather support Jubilee and not the opposition as the ruling party has pledged to address workers&rsquo; problems.Atwoli said Cotu is a free and independent organisation that respects and cherishes a diverse membership in different political parties and ideologies.&ldquo;It would be unfortunate for anyone to try and dictate to our members which political party to support in the next general elections,&rdquo; he said.Atwoli added that Cotu works with the government of the day.He reminded Sang that in 2001, Cotu amended its constitution to cut links with the then ruling party Kanu or any other political parties so that memberswere free to individually support a party of their choice.
