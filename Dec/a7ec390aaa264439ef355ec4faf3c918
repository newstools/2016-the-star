President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s director of digital and diaspora communications Dennis Itumbi yesterday asked for Sh50 million as compensation for unlawful detention over allegations of ICC witness interference.He also seeks an order directing government agencies to end investigations into allegations that he hacked the ICC system.Through lawyer Moses Chelanga, Itumbi said his rights were violated when the state arrested and detained him unconstitutionally for four days without trial. Under the law, one is supposed to be detained in a police station for not more than 24 hours before he or she is arraigned in court.Itumbi was arrested on March 22, 2012, and detained for four days and nights in different police cells in Nairobi as authorities investigated claims of interference with ICC witnesses.Chelanga said police claimed they arrested his client after ICC put in a request.However, he said, the court had indicated that it did not instigate anything that led to Itumbi&rsquo;s arrest.&ldquo;Even after the OTP has distanced itself from the antecedents to the petitioner&rsquo;s arrest, the respondents still hold that the OTP is the principal complainant against the petitioner,&rdquo; Chelanga said.The state asked the court to dismiss Itumbi&rsquo;s suit, saying there is no evidence to show any breach of his constitutional rights occasioned by the state officers.The court was told there was no evidence to sustain any charge against Itumbi and as a result, the state decided not to arraign him in court.The court also heard that the state wrote a letter through the office of the Attorney General, asking the ICC to give more evidence for Kenyan authorities to make a decision on whether to charge Itumbi or not.
