Thika Town MP Alice Ng ang a (pictured) will seek a higher elective post in 2022 and not in 2017 as she plans to serve a second term as legislator, she says.She said it took three attempts to win the MP post and rivals should not expect to go to Parliament easily, as she is confident of reelection.Morris Mburu and engineer Patrick Njuguna want to run for MP. Mburu vied in 2013 and lost to Ng ang a, while Njuguna is contesting for the first time.Ng ang a accused Njuguna of underpaying and impoverishing his workers in his nut factory. It is laughable that someone who pays his workers a meagre Sh180 a day wants to lead them. Let him show his goodwill by paying them at least Sh300, then we can take him seriously, she said.Ng ang a said her rivals are politicising her personal life by speculating on the father of her child. She told them to ask her directly. When a woman fails to get a child it becomes an issue and when she gets one it is still an issue, with questions being raised about the father as if motherhood is a crime, she said.
