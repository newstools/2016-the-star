The driver of a county fire engine that crushed former Kitui Mayor Martha Mwangangi to death last Friday was charged yesterday.Philip Tito, however, did not take a plea as the prosecution, led by state counsel Martin Wanjala and DCI officer Julius Omari, requested more time to conclude investigations.Tito&rsquo;s lawyer Japheth Mwalimu opposed Wanjala&rsquo;s request to hold the accused for 14 days. He told trial magistrate Rose Ombata three days are enough to conclude investigations.Wanjala told the court the case has political undertones and has aroused public excitement because it touches on a prominent politician. He said keeping Tito in custody is also for his own safety.Wanjala said Tito will face two counts of attempting to murder former Lands CS Charity Ngilu and murdering Mwangangi.At some point, Mwalimu differed with his colleague Mbuvi Katunga, who represented Mwangangi&rsquo;s family, when Katunga supported the prosecution&rsquo;s request to be given 14 days to conclude investigations.Mwalimu accused Katunga of usurping the prosecution&rsquo;s role, while he only appeared for Mwangangi&rsquo;s family. Ombata gave the prosecution seven days. The case will be mentioned on December 28.
