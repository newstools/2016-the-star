Garissa residents should maintain the peace and harmonious coexistence during campaigns and elections, Governor Nathif Jama has said. No meaningful development can be achieved in an insecure environment, he said. &ldquo;There are heightened political activities ahead of the 2017 polls. However, as peace-loving people, you should not be influenced by any politician to barter harmony for disharmony. Do not hate anyone for political reasons,&rdquo; Jama said. &ldquo;I am also appealing to those aspiring for elective positions to understand that politics is a short-term phenomenon that comes and goes.&rdquo; Jama spoke at Garissa Primary School yesterday during the Jamhuri Day celebrations. The governor cautioned against hate speech and inciting residents to conflict. County commissioner James Kianda said the government will arrest anyone who incites residents to violence, irrespective of his or her position. &ldquo;We will not sit back and watch as a few individuals incite communities against each other,&rdquo; he said.
