A habitual bhang smoker in Gatanga has slashed his mother to death on Tuesday allegedly for refusing to give him more land.Paul Thuo, 35, attacked Jacinta Njeri, 75, with a panga while she was headed to her shamba in Gathama village and struck her twice in the head.Residents said they heard Njeri scream and ran to her rescue. Thuo fled into a thicket, but was later traced and beaten up by a lynch mob.He was rescued by community policing officials and police.His brother Peter Mwaura said Thuo had threatened to kill their mother many times because she refused to give him more land.&ldquo;He was given his share of land, but leased it three years ago. Since then he has been giving our mother sleepless nights, demanding that she give him the only parcel of land she was farming,&rdquo; Mwaura said.&ldquo;We warned him many times when we found him threatening to take our mother&rsquo;s life, but he never changed.&rdquo;He said Thuo tried to kill his mother three months ago but she was rescued by neighbours. He allegedly bit her on her thighs, causing severe wounds.&ldquo;We hope the police will deal with him accordingly and punish him for killing our mother. In case he is freed he should never return here because we have no place for him and what he has done is unforgivable. He is cursed because the blood of his own mother is in his hands,&rdquo; a teary Mwaura said.Resident Rose Njeri told journalists that Jacinta bailed out her son from Kihumbu-ini police station, where he was detained after his first attempt to kill her.&ldquo;She loved her son dearly to a point of restraining the police from arresting him after he attempted to kill her. If she only knew that he would eventually take her life she would have let the police hold him,&rdquo; she said.Nyumba Kumi neighbourhood watch elder Simon Wainaina said Thuo&rsquo;s behaviour was influenced by bhang. &ldquo;His habits led to his wife and two children deserting him two years ago after he threatened to tear apart his pregnant wife&rsquo;s womb,&rdquo; he said.
