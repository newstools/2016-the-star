At least 10,000 litres of illicit brew suspected to be from Uganda have been confiscated in a crackdown in Marakwet county.County director of prevention of alcoholic and drug abuse Joshua Cherop, who led the week-long crackdown, said the brew in local bars. The crackdown has been on since Friday last week.Cherop said on Thursday that the crackdown was informed by reports of bar owners selling the bootleg, suspected to be from the neighbouring country, to underage persons during this festive season.He said licences for bars found selling second generation alcohol may be revoked.However, Cherop said the county is yet to formulate a law that legalises traditional alcohol.Locals caught drinking the illicit brews during the crackdown said they were not aware they were illegal because they were sold in licensed bars.Residents in most areas of Elgeyo Marakwet have expressed outrage over the sale of second generation in several licensed bars in the county, despite an order by President Uhuru Kenyatta to destroy all the illicit alcohol in 2015. The brews were found in Marakwet West, Keiyo North and Keiyo South subcounties.Elizabeth Jepkorir, a resident of Labot, accused security agencies of failing to stop the return of the second generation alcohol. &ldquo;Where were the security officers when these brews found their way to local bars all the way from Uganda?&rdquo; Jepkorir posed. She said local youth are no longer engaging in meaningful activities because of the brews.
