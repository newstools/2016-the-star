Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe yesterday condemned two violent incidences reported last month in Bungoma on sugarcane poaching.He said the ministry is working to finalise and gazette the sugar regulations to bring order in the industry. The regulations will address contract cane farming among other issues. &ldquo;We have consulted with stakeholders and agreed that cane farming be undertaken on the basis of legally binding and enforceable contracts between the millers and the growers. This is in accordance to a template for the contract that was adopted and came into force in August this year,&rdquo; Lesiyampe said. Early this week, cane cutters from Nzoia Sugar Company harvested cane from farmers contracted to West Kenya Sugar Company Limited. According to the Sugar Directorate, a confrontation ensued during which an employee of Nzoia Sugar was run over by a tractor belonging to West Kenya Company. In a separate incident last week, another employee of Nzoia Sugar was brutally murdered by a gang suspected to be cane cutters hired to cut cane for a rival sugar miller in Kakamega. Five other employees of Nzoia company were injured during the confrontation. &ldquo;We have requested the Inspector General [Joseph Boinnet] to ensure that security is maintained in the cane catchment areas and to investigate and apprehend the culprits involved in the two unfortunate incidences,&rdquo; said the PS.
