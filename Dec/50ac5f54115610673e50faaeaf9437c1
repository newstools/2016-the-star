Former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang&rsquo;ati has said Cord leader Raila Odinga is best placed to save the country from wanton corruption.He said the Jubilee administration is &ldquo;embarrassing Kenyans&rdquo; by not taking decisive action against corruption. &ldquo;We want to change the leadership of this country and we can do that through Raila. He is the only person that can effectively address graft,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati, who is running for Bungoma governor, said.He said Raila is committed to fight graft and has constantly raised questions on the spending of public funds. &ldquo;We need to save the taxes that the people pay. It is an insult to Kenyans that the government is not doing enough to curb looting,&rdquo; Khang&rsquo;ati said.
