Five coaches froM various disciplines will compete for the 2016 Coach of the Year Award when the annual Sports Personality of the Year (Soya) awards are held in January.The quintet included Harambee Starlets coach David Ouma who will be battling it out with serial contender Henry Kirwa, the head coach of the Kenya Olympics athletics team that performed exemplarily at the Rio Olympics as well as Benjamin Ayimba who led the rugby Sevens team to their first ever triumph in a world Sevens series leg.The event is also being sponsored by Kenya Pipeline Company, SuperSport, Communication Authority of Kenya, NSSF, NHIF, Kenya Tourism Board and Lotto Foundation. Also set to vie for the coaching honours are Catherine Mabwi the only female contestant and coach of the national Under-23 volleyball team and hockey coach Jos Openda.Ouma graces the awards for the first time after he made history by taking the Kenyan national women&rsquo;s football team to a first ever African Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations in Camerron where Kenya were bundled out in the group stages after losing all their three matches against Ghana, Mali and Nigeria.Kirwa was head coach of the successful Rio Olympic team despite the scandals that followed Team Kenya in Rio and after.Many however think he should not bask in the glory of the Rio success as the KDF tactician only takes charge of a team that is already prepared by other coaches.The long serving coach can also take credit for Kenya winning the 5,000m women gold and women marathon gold for the first time even though each event had an individual coach.The coach also has a knack of producing results whenever he takes charge of a team as was witnessed at the 2015 World ChampionshipsAyimba was selected for turning around Kenya&rsquo;s fortunes after a difficult 2014/2015 season, with Kenya third from bottom in the series standing guiding Kenya to a historic CupKenya Sevens were semifinalists in the Cape Town 7s, and quarter finalist Hong Kong and Sydney legs of the comeptition .Mabwi meanwhile was in charge of the Malkia Strikers juniors that recently qualified for the 2017 World U-23 Championships after finishing second behind Egypt at Kasarani.Openda on the other hand led the Telkom Orange team to the Africa Club Cup Championship as well as the Kenya Hockey Union National League and the Vaisaki International Tournament (Sikh Community sponsored) as well as championships in the Sanaa and Nairobi Open tournaments.As coach of the national team he led Kenya to a bronze medal at the All Africa Games in South Africa
