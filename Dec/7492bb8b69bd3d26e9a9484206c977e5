The Opposition has obtained temporary orders suspending the awarding of a tender for the supply and delivery of 2017 election ballot papers "for the sake of transparency".Cord through its lawyer James Orengo has argued the awarding of the tender was done contrary to the Election laws and Public Procurement &amp; Assets Disposals Act.IEBC had awarded the Sh2.5 billion tender to a Dubai-based, Al Ghurair printing firm, for printing of election materials including ballot papers.South African-based Paarl Media moved to the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board seeking a review of the award to Al Ghuarair printing company on allegations of irregularities.The opposition also sought an order requiring the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to re-tender.High court judge George Odunga gave the order that will be in force until December 21, when the case is scheduled to be heard.Cord leaders had also called for a comprehensive audit of the voter register to ensure it is accurate. The Opposition has rejected a move by IEBC to award the tender to KPMG.Read:KPMG kicks off voter register auditJubilee, IEBC &lsquo;want to use skewed audit to rig polls&rsquo;
