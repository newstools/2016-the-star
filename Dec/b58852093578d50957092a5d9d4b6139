They spoke at Igoji market.Kirimi said Uhuru has initiated many development projects and this is the best way to appreciate his work.No students enrolled&ldquo;Residents have unanimously agreed Igoji TTC should be named after President Uhuru Kenyatta once it is elevated to a constituent college of Kenyatta University,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;For the short time he has led the country he has exhibited unique leadership qualities, which deserve recognition.&rdquo; Kirimi urged all Kenyans to reelect Uhuru for a second term. The residents said, however, efforts to elevate the TTC to a constituent college seems to have stalled after it failed to enrol students as agreed. They urged Uhuru to personally intervene. Left behindThey said neighboring Ndagani and Meru College of Technology, which were established many years after Igoji TTC, have both been elevated to Chuka University and Meru University. Kirimi said Igoji TTC is on more than 100 acres, which could be used to empower residents economically and academically instead of lying idle. &ldquo;The community set aside this land to develop and empower the people of Igoji in particular, and Kenya in general,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the place has been turned into a venue for political and other meetings and not for the purpose of higher learning as intended by our visionary parents, who generously donated the land.&rdquo;Devolution means making full use of the local resources to develop our county and region, Kirimi said. He said once the college is elevated residents will be able to get a university education locally, without incurring high costs in accommodation and transport.Kirimi said residents will also get jobs, a ready market for their farm produce, socialise with outsiders and revitalise the dying trading centres.
