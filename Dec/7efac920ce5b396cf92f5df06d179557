Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta is proving to be no walk in the park with former DPP Philip Murgor declaration he will run for the country&rsquo;s top job.Murgor has promised to fight graft. Although Murgor will run next year, it is seen as a warmup for 2022. His entry into the race complicates the rush for the Kalenjin vote, with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi expected to run for the country&rsquo;s top seat in 2022 as well. Murgor was yesterday endorsed to run next year on the United Democratic Movement ticket. &ldquo;We know Kenyans have a solution to everything affecting them, but when it comes to politics, as a country we usually go back to the tribal groups and that is what we must overcome,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have high levels of corruption inside the executive office of the Jubilee government that has run the country down and frustrated devolution.&rdquo;Uhuru will seek reelection against an opposition seemingly united through the Nasa outfit. Uhuru has said he will support Ruto&rsquo;s bid in 2022. Murgor said, &ldquo;I will work with people who have integrity and I rule out Jubilee. I am open to coalitions at the party and at the individual level, but the opposition has to drop the corrupt if they want to join us.&rdquo; He said he will promote unity, address gender inequality and strengthen government institutions.&ldquo;Our constitution has solutions to all our problems and we don&rsquo;t need to form commissions but respect the rule of law,&rdquo; Murgor said.He said the country requires a paradigm shift to reclaim lost glory.&ldquo;I also remind the people who have been stealing that Kenyans know them and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many handouts they give or how much they lie to people, one day they will pay the price,&rdquo; Murgor said.He said despite the transformation promise of the Constitution, Kenya&rsquo;s political, social, economic and cultural arrangements are marred by the &ldquo;politics of privilege&rdquo; and perpetuated through a political economy of tribalism.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have billions to spend and even if I did, people should ask me where I got the money from and why I am using a lot of money to campaign,&rdquo; Murgor said.
