Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Nambale MP John Bunyasi have told off critics who constantly accuse them of doing nothing since they took over leadership in 2013.Speaking during the Jamhuri Day celebrations in Nambale Polytechnic on Monday, the two leaders warned residents against being cheated by detractors who fault their development record. Ojaamong said the county has initiated many projects, including solar-powered boreholes, mass lighting and roads, but his critics pretend not have seen them.&ldquo;MCAs from other counties come to Busia to benchmark. This confirms we have made strides. My brothers who have nothing to say about the county should just stop it,&rdquo; he said.Ojaamong said the National Super Alliance has the capacity to send Jubilee home. Bunyasi told critics to give credit where it is due, instead of spreading blatant lies.
