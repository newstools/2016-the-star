Gift Osinya, the brother of three-year-old baby Satrin, who survived a gun attack at a Likoni church on March 3, 2014, is among the top performers in this year s KCPE exam.Gift, who scored 399 marks, told the Star he had expected to get 400 marks and above. He wants to be an engineer.When The Star caught up with him, he was with Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko s wife-Primrose, preparing to go for an interview at a local TV station. We are very happy parents and glad he performed well, Primrose said.Gift and Satrin were attending a church service at Joy Church in Likoni when it was attacked. They lost their mother Veronica Atieno. Sonko adopted the two children a month after Satrin underwent brain surgery at the Kenyatta National Hospital to remove the bullet lodged in his head.Sonko said upon discharge from hospital, Satrin was enrolled at Runda Mumwe Kindergarten. His brother Gift was enrolled in class seven at Bethlehem Academy, a private boarding school in Ruiru.Yesterday, Gift said he was initially at Kenya Navy School in Mtongwe before tragedy befell them. I was performing below average but since I was taken in by my new family, my performance has improved. I attribute this to hardwork, he said. Gift said he will invest the Sh399,000 given to him by Sonko.
