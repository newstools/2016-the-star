Opposition legislators named in government scandals should not drag Cord leader Raila Odinga and the ODM party into absolving them of the crimes.Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga (pictured) and his Kasipul counterpart Oyugi Magwanga said the leaders named in the NYS scandal had personal deals that never involved ODM. &ldquo;If you know you are corrupt or the public is against your leadership please stop hanging on the coat of Raila and dragging us down in our quest for the presidency,&rdquo; Magwanga said.
