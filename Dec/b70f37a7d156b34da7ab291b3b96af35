A section of MPs allied to the Jubilee Party have asked Cord leaders to mobilise their children to take part in the planned January 4 anti-election laws protests.Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale woman rep), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and Dan Wanyama (Webuye West) said those calling for the demo are out to misuse the youth.Speaking separately, they urged Kenyans to stay away from the protests unless the conveners 'bring their wives and children to participate' in the said demonstrations.Wanyama said that those who are calling for the protests do not want peace in the country and are only pursuing their individual selfish interest."Cord leaders failed Kenyans when they refused to participate in the passing of the amendment to election laws at parliament," the legislator said.He said there was nothing wrong with the law, adding that it only gives an alternative way of managing the August 8 vote in the event electronic systems fail."We must be wary of politicians who are hungry for power and want to seize the same by all means," Wanyama said at Milo Primary School on Wednesday.Chidzuga told a gathering at the launch of Lunga Lunga NYS cohort program that Kenyans should not risk their lives by demonstrating."They should be told that Kwale is no longer an ODM zone," the legislator said.She also took issue with politicians who she said are trying to get Jubilee Party ticket after being rejected by other parties.Mwashetani said that the electoral law amendment were important to ensure all parts of the country participate in the 2017 poll."Others are planning to demonstrate but that is not our concern. We will only care if the demos are to push for construction of more schools in our area," he said.Elsewhere, Bishop Philip Anyolo of the Catholic Church Homa Bay diocese warned that the current impasse on election laws in the country might result in bloody polls.He said the tension around the election laws was creating anxiety, and advised that leaders reason together instead of engaging in street confrontations."Leaders from both sides should embrace dialogue between them on the best way to pass the law without creating anxiety," Bishop Anyolo said.He said that the negotiations by the joint parliamentary committee that resulted into the law was the best way to go about the current contention."As the church we urge the opposition to be sober on their calls for demonstrations. The government should also create a conducive environment for dialogue," he said.The chair of Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops said Kenyans need peaceful campaigns and the right to credibly choose leaders that will remove them from povertyAnyolo made the comments at Kitere Catholic Church in Rongo sub-county, days after Cord leader Raila Odinga asked their supporters to join them for the street protests.The senate legal affairs committee began to seek views of the public on the contentious laws on Thursday following a ruling by Speaker Ekwee Ethuro.Read: Ethuro pushes election laws debate to January 4, orders public participationAlso read: Election law changes &lsquo;may trigger post-poll chaos&rsquo;More on this: Raila gives Uhuru nine-day ultimatum on election laws, says demos a last resortReporting by Manuel Odeny, Brian Ojamaa and Alloys Musyoka
