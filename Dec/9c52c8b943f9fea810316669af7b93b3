What sports stars can learn from Arsenal legendArsenal Legend Lauren Etame Mayer visited Kenya last week as the guest of honour for a week-long coaching clinic sponsored by SportPesa.The celebrated footballer who has since retired from the game, had a fabulous career having been part of the Arsenal &lsquo;Invincibles&rsquo; team which won the 2003/04 English Premier League title unbeaten in the entire season. Lauren also won an Olympic Gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Games with Cameroon.During his playing days, like most top footballers, he amassed wealth thanks to the impressive pay that top flight footballers earn especially those in top European leagues where Lauren played for several teams.One thing stood out when I met Lauren. He proudly talked of his private businesses (without delving into too much detail) and his pursuit for more education to ensure no one takes advantage of him.For those who do not know, 39-year old Legend is currently undertaking a Business Management course at the University of Seville. In one of my chats with him during his visit to Kenya he explained that his choice of the Business Management course was out of the need to protect himself from exploitation by some professionals who sometimes take advantage of athletes and footballers due to the massive investments they make and their lack sometimes, of how businesses are run and how contracts are structured.This got me thinking about the recent case of former athlete Daniel Kipchirchir Komen who is currently wallowing in financial troubles despite having made a lot of money at the height of his running career. Komen has sued a politician cum lawyer whom he accuses of swindling him Sh150 million after he entrusted him to handle his property and business deals.Unfortunately in Kenya and other parts of the world, this is not an isolated scenario. Cases of unscrupulous individuals taking advantage of sports men and women have been rife. It was impressive to learn that an ex-footballer (Lauren) is engaging in thriving private businesses and is even hoping to invest more in the global economy.Back home, a young promising footballer &ndash; Zidane Ochieng- who previously had no plans of furthering his education after finishing form four in 2017 has now had an about-turn and wants to enrich his life by pursuing an engineering course concurrently with his football career; thanks to a full scholarship he obtained from SportPesa chairman Paul Ndung&rsquo;u.The 16-year old who was discovered during the SportPesa Super 8 league that ended last month was named the most promising footballer of the tournament.The budding football pro has even earned a call-up to the national under 17 team thanks to his prowess. His future looks bright no doubt and I believe with his massive talent it is a matter of if and not when, that this young player catches the eye of top clubs in the world, an achievement that could earn him millions if not billions.It is in this regard that his latest achievement- netting a full scholarship- will help him to grow wholesomely to ensure that he does not become another statistic of an exploited sportsman. Balancing education and sporting prowess is the way to go if we are to create, nurture and restore hope in the ability of sports to change one&rsquo;s socio-economic status.&#8203; &ndash;SportPesa Senior Content Editor
