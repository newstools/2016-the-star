The Mombasa Jubilee faction, allied to former Kisauni MP Anania Mwaboza, has denied claims that Hassan Joho has sponsored them to wreak havoc in the party.The faction led by Ali Mwatsahu noted they have been in Jubilee longer than any of the members of the rival team led by Suleiman Shahbal.They said they cannot possibly be working with their main rival Joho, who is Mombasa Governor.Mwatsahu demanded a repeat of Mombasa elections claiming the Shahbal team engaged in malpractices.&ldquo;They stole the elections and now want to push us out by coming up with outrageous allegations. We must have a repeat election in Mombasa,&rdquo; he said on Monday.Mwatsahu said JP will not win the Mombasa governor race with Shahbal as the flag bearer.He said his team will be forced to move to court, a move that he noted will complicate matters for Jubilee.&ldquo;We all know going to court is never a good idea but we will be forced to. These people know that man cannot win,&rdquo; he said.The politician added that he was in Kanu with President Uhuru Kenyatta then moved to URP with Ruto and Mwaboza, before forming Jubilee Alliance Party which later transformed into Jubilee Party.Read: Mombasa Jubilee splinter group rejects poll results, declare themselves winnersViolence marred the election in Mombasa, as was the case in several other parts of the country.Former TNA politician Matano Chengo, who is allied to Shahbal, was elected interim county chairman as Mwaboza's faction staged a boycott.But on Saturday, a team of Shahbal supporters called for a truce saying they had resolved to work with Mwaboza's team.Led by Mombasa women representative aspirant Margaret Ambasa, they said they had decided to set their differences aside for Uhuru and DP William Ruto's re-election.But the Mwaboza faction denied reports that they had negotiated a deal with Shahbal's team.&ldquo;Shahbal and his group should not push us out of the house they joined the other day,&rdquo; said Janet Jawambe, a strong Mwatsahu ally.&ldquo;Joho and I are like cotton and fire. We cannot even sit in the same room. How can I work with him?"Jawambe further said a smear campaign cannot be used to push her out of Jubilee yet she made personal sacrifices in support of the party.&ldquo;I will die with Jubilee,&rdquo; she declared when the press addressed the press at Jawambe Hotel. &ldquo;They (Shahbal team) are the moles who joined us the other day.&rdquo;Peter Gichamba said they recognised Mwatsahu as their interim chairperson, and not Chengo.&ldquo;That team is bogus. They have no leadership qualities. They are the ones who let us down in 2013,&rdquo; he said.Read: Jubilee will win 2017 poll 'even if by buying, stealing' votes - ShahbalAlso read: Jubilee afraid millions of its ghost voters will be exposed, Mombasa Luos sayShahbal joined politics with United Democratic Forum before defecting to Wiper through which he lost the Mombasa governor race to Joho in 2013.
