Kenya Volleyball Federation are targeting school going children to enroll in beach volleyball as part of their strategy to professionalise the game.Kenya has never had a professional beach volleyball player with the entire current crop doubling up in both conventional and indoor version of the sport. KVF secretary general Ben Juma and beach volleyball commission chairman said this will streamline the Olympics discipline in Kenya to attain international standards. &ldquo;We want players to gain experience from an early age, and grow in the game from one age group to the next till they graduate to senior levels,&rdquo; said Juma. He also intimated that 2016 Magharibi Michezo awards coach of the year and SOYA nominee in a similar category Catherine Mabwi and beach volleyball tutor Patrick Owino have been scouting for potential players at school games. He said the first national circuit will start next month in Mombasa where there will be both under 18 and 21 alongside the senior men and women categories. The tournament will be used to select pairs that will represent Kenya at the Sub Zone Five &lsquo;B&rsquo; in February at a yet to be announced city. The tourney will bring together Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. &ldquo;Kenya has good players. We are still a powerhouse in African beach volleyball and especially in women&rsquo;s. We only need to be more vibrant to firmly hold onto the pole position in Africa, and later the world,&rdquo; intimated Juma. Kenya Pipeline&rsquo;s pair of Gaudencia Makokha and Naomi Too is rated in Africa&rsquo;s top four.He said Kenya would have been represented in Rio but the players failed to take part in the Olympics Africa&rsquo;s final leg qualifier in Tunisia due to financial issues. &ldquo;Our teams had high chances of qualifying but unfortunately we could not raise enough money to send them to Tunisia,&rdquo; he added.
