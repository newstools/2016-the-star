Placement of students in universities and colleges will kickoff mid-next month, officials have said. This follows the release of the 2016 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education Examination results on Thursday.&ldquo;Once back from holiday on January 3, we will convene a stakeholders&rsquo; meeting that will help set the criteria, that includes the cutoff points, to guide the placement,&rdquo; Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service Board chairman Peter Ndetei said.Other than meeting the required entry marks, he said placement will also be informed by affirmative action based on gender, minority groups and those with disabilities.The exercise will come seven months earlier. Previously, placement was done around July of every year, two months or so ahead of reporting date to universities. This gives parents and students little time to prepare.Ndetei assured students and parents that the placement will be fair and transparent. &ldquo;The exercise will be purely electronic with no human influence, meaning that it will give every student equal opportunity depending on their performance and programme choices,&rdquo; he said.Last year, KUCCPS set the cutoff at B- of 58 points for boys and a B- of 56 points for girls for degree programmes. But following the 2016 performance, where only 88, 929 met the university entry mark of C+ and above compared to last year&rsquo;s 169,492, the agency will be forced to revise the cutoff point to fill more than 90,000 government-sponsored slots in universities. Of those who sat the exam, 300,995 were male and 273, 130 female, 52.43 per cent and 47.57 per cent of the total candidature respectively. Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i said the poorer grades in the exam were because of the strict measures that were put in place to curb cheating.
