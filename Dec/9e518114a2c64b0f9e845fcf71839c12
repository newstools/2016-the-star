Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has said the aim of naming the region's preferred presidential candidate is to ensure the community votes as a block.Atwoli said the focus of the Luhya community on the 2017 poll is not about which party to back but on how to consolidate the region's large number of votes in one basket."This is my agenda and it is going to succeed," Atwoli told the Star on telephone Sunday.Atwoli, who is currently in London on a one week-tour, has been spearheading unity talks among the Luyha community.He said Luhyas living in diaspora have pledged their support to the cause and will travel to Kenya to witness the unveiling of the region's preferred candidate at Muliro Gardens on December 31.Atwoli said the person who will be unveiled will therefore be mandated by the community to either go it alone for presidency or work with like-minded parties so as to form the next government.It is at the end of year meeting that the organisers said that results of a popularity survey among western leaders will be unveiled officially.Atwoli was endorsed by 15 MPs from the region to act as the community's spokesperson.The planned rally comes at a time when Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has announced that they are in discussions with Cord on how to go about the August 8 vote.Read: Atwoli to name voice of Luhyas, &lsquo;restore unity&rsquo; on New Year&rsquo;s EveAlso read: Atwoli pursues 2017 unity among reluctant LuhyasMore on this: Wetang&rsquo;ula in fix as Luyhas front Mudavadi
