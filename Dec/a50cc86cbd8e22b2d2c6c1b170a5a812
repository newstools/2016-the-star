The Kiambu government has been feted for being among the best counties in automating revenue collection and boosting local collection.Mombasa and Laikipia were also feted by the Commission on Revenue Authority in recognition of Growth in Own Source of Revenue . The awards ceremony was held in Mombasa at the conclusion of a county revenue automation conference.The state was asked to support the counties in ending corruption through automation of services.Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said automation of services helped the county double revenue collection. We have completely sealed the tax leakage holes that characterised the defunct local authorities, he said at the Whitesands Hotel.Kiambu used to collect Sh800 million, but in 2015-16, it collected more than Sh2.4 billion, he said.This is bound to rise when all systems start working effectively, the governor said. Kiambu has a potential of collecting Sh5 billion, but we lack enforcement mechanisms. We cannot arrest or charge rate defaulters on our own without following the court process. The counties should be empowered to enforce their laws, Kabogo said.Last year, Kiambu was not able to collect Sh2.4 billion land rates, he said.
