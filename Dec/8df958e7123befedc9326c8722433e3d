Property owners in Wote town have 14 days to connect their premises to the Makueni government water supply system or face closure.They should be connected to the Wote Urban Water System that Water executive Douglas Mbilu says can adequately supply the whole town.The county is targeting hoteliers, residential houses and health facilities in the town&rsquo;s central business district that are operating without proper water supply.Mbilu on Wednesday conducted a door-to-door inspection of buildings.&ldquo;I have taken this unconventional decision because a majority of property owners have deliberately refused to connect to the water system and their tenants depend on donkey transport for supply,&rdquo; Mbilu said.The order is in line with the directive that bars animals from the town, he said.Water vendors mainly use donkeys to supply water in the town.&ldquo;The Makueni government has spent more than Sh10 million to supply piped water from two sources to the town. If kicking out donkeys is what makes Kibwana lose votes, so be it,&rdquo; Mbilu said.The move to ban donkeys from supplying water within the town has sparked ugly exchanges between the vendors and the water executive.
