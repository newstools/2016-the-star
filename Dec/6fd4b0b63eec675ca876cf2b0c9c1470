Or is there another underlying reason behind the delays in disbursements?A row has been brewing between the Bomet County Assembly and the Governor&rsquo;s office over delays in the release of stipends to be paid out to elderly county residents. According tothis article, a local Member of County Assembly MCA, Mr. Bernard Ng&rsquo;eno, has called out the Governor, Mr. Isaac Ruto, over false claims that the County Assembly has blocked the release of funds to be used to pay out the stipends. As a result of the alleged obstruction, elderly residents have not received these funds over the past three months. Approximately 15,000 elderly people are beneficiaries of stipends from this county government scheme.Mr. Ng&rsquo;eno claims that the County Assembly has actually supported this program and approved the increase of the budgetary allocations from KSh288 million in 2015/2016 to KSh480 million in the 2016/17 financial year to enable the elderly obtain membership and services such as medical insurance from the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF).So, the question is: is the County Assembly blocking the release of a critical safety net for elderly people in Bomet County?PesaCheck has researched the issue, with input from the International Budget Partnership in Kenya, and finds that the claim made that the County Assembly is delaying the disbursement of funds to the elderly is FALSE.According to the county documents, The County Assembly passed theBomet County Support for the Needy Act in 2014 to establish these funds. The County assembly further approved funding to the program and therefore, there are funds allocated towards these stipends in the current financial year. Also FALSE is the claim by Mr Ngeno that the county assembly has increased the allocation to this program to KSh480 million. This program&rsquo;s funding allocation actually decreased fromKSh303.5 million allocated in the 2015/2016 supplementary budget toKSh288 millionallocated in the current 2016/17 budget.This report was written by PesaCheck FellowLeo Mutuku, who is co-founder and chief executive at a data-science consultancy in Nairobi.
