Property of unknown value was lost in the blaze.Hotel chief of security Karisa Masha said the fire is suspected to have started in the main kitchen, before spreading to the bar.

We responded quickly and tried to put it out. The fire spread fast and it was hard to put it out, as it moved from the kitchen to the bar area,&rdquo; Masha said.The Lamu government sent a team of enforcement officers, who assisted in putting out the fire.Hotel general Manager Nimu Githahu said it will run as usual, since the guest rooms were not affected.
