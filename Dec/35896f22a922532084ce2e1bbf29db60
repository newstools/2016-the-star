ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has warned President Uhuru Kenyatta that Kenyans will not sit and watch tampering with the credibility of the 2017 polls.He told the President on Thursday there is no justification in leading a lawless country.Mudavadi spoke after Jubilee MPs forced amendments to the election laws against the wishes of Cord MPs that they give consultation a chance.&ldquo;The backdoor manoeuvers by Jubilee to sneak amendments in the election laws, whose aim is to aid rigging of elections, reveal the tricks of a cornered and dangerous wildebeest,&rdquo; the ANC leader said.The amended laws allow manual voter identificaiton and tabulation if electronic systems fail. They also lift limits on campaign spending.Mudavadi termed this week&rsquo;s chaotic scenes in the National Assembly, which culminated in the passing the law on Thursday, a violation of the Constitution. He told Uhuru that peace is a dividend of a credible election.&ldquo;The Jubilee regime has sensed defeat and the unholy attempt to legislate illegalities is just one move. The President is abetting anarchy,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.Cord MPs had during the Tuesday&rsquo;s Special Sitting of the House thwarted Jubilee&rsquo;s attempt to push through the changes.They said the law Jubilee wants amended is a negotiated process that can only be altered through structured consultations.However, the Jubilee leadership did not relent, summoning its allied MPs to State House on Wednesday in a meeting was chaired by Deputy President William Ruto. The instructions were clear &mdash; the changes must be passed, come what may.But moments after Cord&rsquo;s temporary victory in the House, the Jubilee leadership regrouped. National National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi was forced to issue a gazette notice recalling MPs for another special sitting on Thursday, when changes were made.Sensing their numbers would not change anything, Cord MPs stormed out of the chamber, accusing Muturi of playing partisan politics.&ldquo;The most outrageous assault on credible elections is Jubilee&rsquo;s determination to rig elections using the Speaker to convene special sessions. This is a warning to democratic forces that Jubilee will go to any length to rig forthcoming elections and must be on a permanent watch list of wanted felons on the matter of credible elections,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.The ANC leader also accused Jubilee of plotting violence.
