A special needs boy from Kakamega scored 437 marks to top this year's KCPE exam, the most credible and nearly cheat-proof due to reforms introduced by Education CS Fred Matiang'i.The score of Victor Oduor from Daisy Special school for the Physically Handicapped in Kakamega was below last year's top score of 449, earned by Aggrey Akhanyinya from St Joseph Academy in Kakamega.Oduor has fragile bones and a hearing impairment. I thank God, my parents and my teachers who walked with me through this journey to success, a joyous Odhiambo said as he celebrated with family and friends.The 15-year old was among 1,950 candidates with special needs who took the KCPE examinations, the most heavily guarded and secure exams in Kenya's history.A total 952,472 pupils sat the exam in 26,308 centres.No leakage was reported but there were 21 cases of attempted theft.No results were also cancelled, in contrast with past years when hundreds of candidates results were cancelled for cheating.This year, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the ministry of Education to prepare and administer Special National Examination papers for candidates with special needs.These candidates received an extra 45 minutes instead of the usual 30 minutes for exams.Papers were adapted to be suitable for them. More examiners were recruited and trained to handle special needs students' exams and papers."The President is pleased the ministry has introduced a raft of measures that have worked this is important in meeting the Jubilee administration s goal of ensuring exclusivity in the education sector," State House Spokesman Manoa Esipisu said yesterday.The President's goal of attaining 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school remains on course, he said.Uhuru praised Matiang i ,CS for IT Joe Mucheru and Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery for a job well done.The analysis of candidate trends by gender over three years indicates the percentage increase in the number of girls has consistently been higher than that of boys.Students who earned 301 marks and 400 marks number 207,141 21.75p per cent.Those earning 201 and 300 marks number 505,552 students.Those who earning 101 to 200 marks number 221,438 students - 23.25 per cent.And 6,747 scored 100 marks and below. I also wish to assure the public that all candidates who scored 400 marks and above will be admitted to national schools, irrespective of their gender, region or centre.The Form One selection exercise will commence on December 9, 2016, Matiang i said when announcing the results.Admission letters to Form One will be issued before Christmas, Matiang'i said.Matiang'i observed that the top candidate with 437 marks out of the maximum possible 500 marks, would not have been placed among the top 90 candidates in last year's CPE examinations if his reforms had not been implemented.Girls performed better than boys in language subjects - English, Kiswahili and Kenya Sign Language - while boys performed better than girls in mathematics, science, social studies and religion.Of the total 942,021 candidates who sat the exams, 49.7 percent were girls and 50.3 percent boys.This indicates gender composition that has been relatively constant over three years.There is, however, a percentage increase in the number of girl in the last three years, compared with boys.Nearly half the counties (23) of the regions registered more girls than boys in the KCPE exam.They are Mombasa, Nyandarua, Kiambu, Machakos, Kitui, Embu, Meru, Makueni, Nairobi, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Kericho, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Busia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga, Kisii and Kisumu, Nyamira.There was also a marked improvement for the 1,950 candidates with disabilities.The top candidate scored 421 marks out of 500.From yesterday, candidates were able to access results by sending the index number through an SMS to 22252 immediately after the release.This year's Form One selection ready for admission on January 9 takes effect immediately, as opposed to the one-month wait for candidates joining secondary school in February.The CS said selection will be based on merit, quotas, equity, affirmative action and candidate choices.The selection will also ensure that children from disadvantaged backgrounds continue their education.
