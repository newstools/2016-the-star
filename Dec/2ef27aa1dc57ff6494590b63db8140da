New Uasin Gishu police boss Nelson Daliti (pictured) has been transferred just two weeks after he took over.It remains unclear why Daliti was moved to Meru, but some sources have linked it to a dispute over the Kikuyu community&rsquo;s decision to instal a spokesman in Eldoret at a ceremony, which had been cancelled.Some local leaders, including Governor Mandago, opposed the event.
