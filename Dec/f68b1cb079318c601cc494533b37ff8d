The High Court has declared that President Uhuru Kenyatta violated the law by failing to meet the two-thirds gender rule in his current Cabinet.Justice Joseph Onguto said the Cabinet as constituted does not meet the gender requirement. He, however, suspended his decision for eight months on grounds that if the current Cabinet is disbanded, this will create unnecessary tension as the country gears for the general election.&ldquo;After the 2017 general election, the President should observe the two-thirds gender rule,&rdquo; Onguto said.Uhuru&rsquo;s Cabinet is comprised of 18 men and five women. It has 15 men Cabinet Secretaries, an Attorney General, who is also a man, and five women CSs. The composition of the women in the Cabinet is 21.7 per cent of the total number of CSs.The case was filed by Centre for Rights Education and Awareness and other activists. They argued that the five women in a Cabinet of 23 members violates the Constitution&rsquo;s two-thirds gender requirement.A group of activists moved to court seeking to have the Cabinet declared unconstitutional.They argued that Article 152 ( 1 ) of the Constitution provides that the Cabinet comprises of the President, the Deputy President, the Attorney General and not fewer than 14 and not more than 22 Cabinet Secretaries.The activists also claimed that if the provisions of Article 27 were to be complied with, and even assuming the female gender was to be the lesser represented in the Cabinet, it would follow that at least 33.3 per cent of the membership of the Cabinet must be women.The Attorney General, who was part of the case, was sued on his own behalf for failing to advise the President and the National Assembly on the constitutional requirement in regard to gender composition of the Cabinet.
