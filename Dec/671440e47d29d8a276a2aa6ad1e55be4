Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i is surely the CS of the Year 2016.His early release yesterday of this year s Kenya Certificate of KCPE examination results, a week before schedule, capped the extraordinary measures taken bythe Education and Interior ministries to safeguard the integrity of the tests.The results are rightly being widely hailed as probably the cleanest national exams since the very early years of Independence 53 years ago.Matiang i spearheaded the measures taken to prevent cheating and corrupt marking.Exam and marking centres were under armed police guard nationwide and out of bounds. A total of 952,472 candidates sat the exam at 26,308 centres from November 1-3.It is good to have the results before Christmas, start the school term in early January instead of February, a much better schedule.This year s performance should be made permanent, the face of the future, the standard.
