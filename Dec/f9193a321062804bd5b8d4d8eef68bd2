Self-proclaimed healer and pastor Victor Kanyari has moved to court in a bid to unfreeze an account being investigated over money laundering.He wants the High Court to reverse orders issued by a magistrate court last month, freezing his personal account at the Cooperative Bank, River Road branch.Kanyari has sued the Directorate of Criminal Investigation, who obtained the orders on November 21, and the magistrate's court.His bid to have the orders lifted before Christmas failed and he was directed to appear before the court today.The preacher was a few years ago exposed for "fake miracles" and duping believers into giving money and gifts to the church with the promise that God would solve their problems.Police informed the court they have received numerous complaints from the public and were probing allegations that he has been using the account to launder money.&ldquo;The orders freezing the account were unreasonably given and have caused me irreparable loss and suffering,&rdquo; the pastor states in an affidavit.&ldquo;The probe being undertaken will assist police to find out if it&rsquo;s true the pastor has obtained money by false pretenses from the public," investigator Boaz Ogaga says.Ogaga was allowed by the court to obtain crucial details from the bank including, statements and cash transfer documents made by Kanyari between January 1, 2012 and October this year.But Kanyari says the orders are unreasonable as no prove was tabled before court to prove that he has committed any offence to warrant the freezing of his account.
