Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s allies are planning to field a strong aspirant against Baringo Senator Gideon Moi if he seeks reelection. Former East African and Regional Cooperation minister Musa Sirma is said to be seen as having the capacity to shake the senator&rsquo;s popularity. &ldquo;We know they are grooming some people to take on Gideon, but let them know that Kanu is stronger and their man will be beaten hands down,&rdquo; Kanu official Paul Kibet said.
