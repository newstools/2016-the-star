Cord leader Raila Odinga skipped a meeting endorsing Musalia Mudavadi's as the presidential candidate for the Amani National Coalition on Friday.He sent Siaya Senator James Orengo for the meeting.Mudavadi said the opposition has no option but to form an alliance that will send President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration home in the 2017 general elections."Kenya is on the deathbed, bleeding and moaning over the rampant corruption within Jubilee. It is time to make painful sacrifices," he said."We will betray Kenyans if we dither because it's not about who but what we can do for the people," he added.Mudavadi said IEBC must stop crucial procurement until new commissioners are in office and a multilateral electoral conference is convened prior to the August polls.On his part, Orengo accused Jubilee of milking the country dry."People who call themselves hustlers are not fit to be anywhere near the leadership of this country. A hustler is a social outcast, a misfit who doesn't behave well. That person is called a hoodlum," he said.Mudavadi is spearheading the National Super Alliance that will bring together Cord-affiliate parties - Raila's ODM, Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper and Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya - against Uhuru's Jubilee party.On Tuesday, Raila and Mudavadi held a meeting in Laikipia and Tharaka Nithi to seal a super alliance deal.The two said they regretted parting ways ahead of the 2013 general election."We will be together in 2017," Raila declared at Resort hotel in Laikipia North constituency, and promised Uhuru's Jubilee Party a bruising battle.He urged voters to arm themselves with identity and voters cards.&ldquo;Come February next year it will not be business as usual. This government is full of thieves who need to be taken home. We want to bring change to this country," he said.Read: We will form 'super alliance' with Cord to defeat Jubilee - MudavadiAlso read: Gideon Moi to be DP in Nasa line-up
