Fifteen-time Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia have started a lottery as an income generating venture.Goma Lotto is a mobile based lottery that will be used to raise funds to meet the club&rsquo;s financial obligations by funding their projects and programmes.&ldquo;Two years ago, we sought to acquire the license from the Betting Board and we commissioned a company to offer the services because we don&rsquo;t have the capacity to run the project,&rdquo; said Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier.Rachier said the club has an ambitious plan of build a club house, their own stadium, set up a youth football academy and cater the club&rsquo;s officials and players welfare including a medical scheme.He said proceeds from the lottery will also be used to develop youth football development programmes countrywide. &ldquo;The development of Kenya&rsquo;s youth projects include investment into youth group activities and businesses,&rdquo; Goma Lotto CEO, Dorothy Liech.Rachier said their first priority is build a stadium and they have already identified a seven acre plot and will be doing ground breaking of its construction in May next year.A bus is at stake in the Goma Lotto&rsquo;s first grand draw to be held after three months. Dorothy said Goma lotto has the best odds with draws taking place every 30 minutes between 6:30am and 9:30pm. The minimum bet is Sh20 and the one is entitled to win 300 times of the bet and is eligible to members of the public aged as from 18 years and over.
