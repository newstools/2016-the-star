Britain have been asked to reconsider their decision of pulling next year&rsquo;s World under 18 athletics Championship in Nairobi.Athletic Kenya president Jackson Tuwei said they have a relationship with Britain dating many years back and doesn&rsquo;t see the reason why they won&rsquo;t attend the event.A statement on the British Athletics website indicated that the country will instead focus its energies on qualifying for the Commonwealth Youth Games due on July 19-23, next year in Nassau.However, Tuwei said many countries will participate in the Commonwealth Youth Games including Kenya hence the Britain can do both. &ldquo;We have so many countries who will participate in both in the Commonwealth Games and the under 18 World Championships in Nairobi hence they can prepare and do both,&rdquo; he said. The AK boss was speaking during the 11th edition of Safaricom Kisumu City Marathon on Sunday at the Lakeside city. Tuwei said preparations for the World Under-18 Championships are in top gear and they expect many countries to participate in the event set for July next year at Kasarani. &ldquo;We have invited all members of IAAF and we expect most of the countries to attend,, he added. He said participation in the event is voluntary and there is little they can to as hosts to compel countries who don&rsquo;t want to attend to do so. Tuwei gave an example of a past championship held in Colombia, where out of the 214 invited countries, only 157 attended.
