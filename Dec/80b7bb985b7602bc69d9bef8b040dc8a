The Embu county assembly has been censured by Auditor General Edward Ouko (pictured) for wasting more than Sh11 million on committee sittings outside the county in the 2014-15 financial year. In the annual audit report and financial statement, an examination of the assembly&rsquo;s records has established Sh11,040,179 was paid to MCAs and committee staff, while attending official activities.The report says there was no proper reason why conferences and retreats for the MCAs were held in hotels away from the county, yet the assembly had prequalified local hospitality service providers for the financial year. Also, the Auditor General has criticised the assembly for paying Sh1, 276,000, including Sh108, 000 transport allowances, which was not documented and the basis for paying was not explained.&ldquo;In view of the foregoing, the propriety of the expenditure of Sh11, 040,179 and Sh1, 276,000, totalling Sh12, 316,179, could not be confirmed,&rdquo; the report reads.Ouko further put the assembly on the spot for spending Sh961,190 on a trip by 19 MCAs to Mombasa. He says the supporting documents only accounted for Sh589,000, hence, leaving an unsupported balance of Sh372,190. In that year, the assembly is blamed for paying Sh1, 927,190 to a travel company, Sh720,000 as booking fee for return air tickets from Nairobi to Arusha for nine persons and Sh246,000 for change of reservations for the nine persons, totalling Sh966,000.The report says another booking fee for return air tickets from Nairobi to Mombasa for 19 persons was charged at Sh528,200 by the same travel company.
