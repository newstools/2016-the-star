Anti-FGM lobbyists have been urged to meet victims of the vice instead of fighting the practice through hotel workshops.Lucy Lekumoisa of Nomadrise Initiave - a CBO - asked those involved in the war against the cut to meet affected girls at the communities where they live.She urged the concerned organisations to conduct anti-FGM activities without the fear of bruising members of the community that still glorify the cut.Lekumoisa told a meeting in Samburu East on Tuesday that it was sad most activists make noise in Nairobi hotels but don't speak when they visit the affected villages. The CBO led more than 300 residents of the constituency in erecting a giant billboards at the entrance of a primary school with messages that discourage the vice."We have to shy away from harmful cultural practices. And we can only do that by directly dealing with the people who still hold the same close to their hearts," Lekumoisa said.Keward Lekalkulu, Waso West location chief, said the residents have promised to stop circumcising and marrying-off underage girls. They said they would instead adopt education for all as a way of eradicating poverty as well as enabling people learn the dangers associated with the culture.Samburu is one of the communities where FGM is deemed as a crucial right of passage for girls.Dr Tammary Esho, in a recent survey, indicated that FGM prevalence is very high in Samburu community at 86 per cent after Somali's 94 per cent."We will not tolerate FGM and early marriages here. As chief, I will take the initiative of making sure that no girlchild is circumcised and married-off," Lekalkulu said. Lilian Letore, a resident, said that the erected billboard will be acting as a reminder to all residents that FGM is illegal. She said the picture of a young pupil holding a razor blade with blood stains is a warning that no girl should be circumcised. The pictures were drawn by primary school girls from which the best communicating photo was selected to be used on the bill board.
