We have attended over six meetings demanding implementation of June 2013 CBA," secretary general Ouma Oluga said.Addressing media in Mombasa on Saturday, Oluga said there has been no offers from the government as claimed by Kiraithe."The offers that the government is talking about have not been made to us, maybe to the media," Oluga said.Kiraithe on Friday appealed to the "professional doctors" who do not want to strike to continue with the work, adding "we will provide security".On December 13, the Labour Relations court declared the doctors strike illegal and ordered them to resume work immediately.The court directed union officials to call off the strike that has contributed to the deaths of over 20 people.Health workers countrywide downed their tools saying it would be the longest in Kenya's history.More on this: Doctors begin 'longest strike in history' over 2013 CBA agreementUnions are demanding a 300 per cent pay increment for doctors, and 25 to 40 per cent rise for nurses.They said they had signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement with the government in 2013 but that it is yet to be implemented.Read: Health crisis deepens as private hospitals prepare to join doctors' strikeThe government had offered a Sh50,000 increase for the lowest paid doctors, which would raise their salaries to Sh176,000, but unions rejected it and walked out of talks.President Uhuru Kenyatta also urged doctors to return to work promising that a solution would be found.More on this: Uhuru urges striking doctors to return to work, pledges to resolve row
