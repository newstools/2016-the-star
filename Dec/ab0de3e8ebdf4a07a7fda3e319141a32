All companies said to have transacted business with the NYS, leading to loss of millions of shillings, should be probed by the EACC, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has said.Initially, the amount said to have been lost in the scam was Sh791 million but this figure increased after the Auditor General s report showed the amount lost was Sh1.6 billion.On Tuesday, Lusaka said the NYS scandal has become a hot issue, with new information about the theft unfolding every day. He said Kenyans need to know who was involved in looting taxpayers money and see them put behind bars.Lusaka said, Let proper investigations be done by the relevant agencies and if there is enough evidence that someone stole public funds, let them face the full wrath of the law. He said some companies being associated with the scandal are associated with senior politicians. Those found to have participated in stealing taxpayers cash should carry their own cross, he said.This comes as the Bonito Group of companies belonging to Bungoma businessman and politician Wycliffe Wangamati was mentioned to be among those that were contracted by the NYS.Wangamati, the son of Ford Kenya nominated MP Patrick Wangamati, is seeking to unseat Lusaka.He has denied that his firm was associated with the NYS in graft, saying they only did the job they were given and have not been paid for the work.
