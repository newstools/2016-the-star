The High Court in Mombasa yesterday reviewed the bond for two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners from Sh30 million to Sh5 million.Justice Dorah Chepkwony said the court has the discretion to change any orders given by another court. &ldquo;It' i legal for the High Court to intervene and discharge its own orders, I therefore grant the orders sought by the respondents,&rdquo; she said. Baktash, Ibrahim Akasha, Gulam Hussein and Vijaygiri Goswami were accused of smuggling heroin worth Sh1 billion into the country in 2014. They are wanted in the US for drug trafficking.Chepkwony also allowed the respondents to move around the country once they inform the authorities, unlike before when they were not allowed to move outside Mombasa. The court ordered them to report to the police twice every month. On December 1, chief magistrate Maxwell Gicheru released them on Sh5 million bond, which was later reviewed by High Court judge Martin Muya to Sh30 million. The court said it has been one and a half years since the respondents were released on bond and have adhered to the conditions given. Last week, the court summoned eight witnesses, who are to testify in the extradition proceedings.
