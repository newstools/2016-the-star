Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba on Friday said he will work with President Uhuru Kenyatta's government.Namwamba said that his Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) will work with Jubilee to ensure that his region reap benefits.He termed the decision to work with Jubilee government as 'mature politics' that will promote development in Busia county and the entire Western region."We want to play mature politics. I am here to receive the President because despite being in the opposition, there is a difference between a political rival and an enemy," he said."As leaders from Busia, we are ready to work with those who are development-oriented," the former ODM leader Raila Odinga's right-hand man said.Uhuru was received in the county by area governor Sospeter Ojaamong and his Bungoma counterpart Ken Lusaka among other leaders from the region.Deputy President William Ruto accompanied the president who was in his last lap of the two-day work tour of Western.Lusaka appealed to the Luhya community to join the government so as to benefit in terms of development.Namwamba cautioned Luhya community to shun divisive politics, a statement perceived to be referring to Opposition leader Raila Odinga."Development oriented politics is what you should embrace. Long gone are the days for leaders who practised divisive politics," he said.Namwamba quit the Orange party, citing frustration from Raila's close allies, a situation he said denied him an opportunity to make critical decisions.Read: Ababu resigns as ODM secretary general, narrates Raila Odinga's betrayalDuring the tour of Western, Uhuru launched various development projects among the reopening of Webuye Rai Paper.Other projects included upgrading of the Ibokolo-Indangalasia-Malaa road and the Mumias water supply project.In his address, the president said Kenyans were not ready to dance to the whims of the opposition, adding that the latter have plans to amend the Constitution to suit their interest."I have called on opposition leaders to spare Kenyans the destructive politics they engage in every election year," Uhuru said at one of the stopovers."They should instead engage in politics based on policies and should recognise that political rivalry is not equal to enmity," the President told residents of Western.While launching construction of the Ibokolo road, Uhuru said: "Our aim is to come up with projects that are beneficial to Kenyans. Improved roads can increase opportunities for trade and investment,"He said asked the residents to dismiss opposition's claims that Jubilee has taken long to tarmac the said roads "yet they didn't do so when they were in power for more than 30 years".
