Two teenagers were electrocuted on Friday while hanging clothes that they had washed on a line at their house in Eldoret.The brothers, aged 18 and 13 years, died instantly when they got into contact with the line that was in contact with an active live wire.Cornelius Okello, their father, said one of his sons had scored 324 marks in the recently released KCPE results while the other was to proceed to form two."It seems the technicians could have left a naked wire which was in contact with the clothes line. It is sad to lose such young boys," Okello said.Police and Kenya Power officials arrived at the scene as investigations began into the incident that left Okello's family in shock.Read: Kenya power staff killed by electrocution during Kisumu repairsAlso read: Electrocuted student, 17, laid to rest in Limuru
