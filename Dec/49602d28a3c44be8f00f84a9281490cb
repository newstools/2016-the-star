Jamhuri Day celebrations in Mombasa on Monday turned into an anti-Jubilee crusade as Coastal leaders attacked the government, accusing it of &ldquo;high levels of corruption&rdquo;.Governor Hassan Joho said, &ldquo;Kenya has never witnessed such a corrupt government since Independence. Let us be honest, the Jubilee government has by far surpassed the cases of graft that were witnessed during the Jomo Kenyatta, Moi and Kibaki regimes.&rdquo;Present were MPs Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni), Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Hezron Awiti (Nyali) and Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko.Joho said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto do not deserve a second term.Some of the Jubilee government scandals include the Sh1.3 billion NYS fraud, the Sh3.2 billion allegedly lost at Ministry of Health and the Sh100 million used to hire a private jet for Ruto in 2013.Joho said the Sh3.2 billion allegedly lost at the Ministry of Health could have resolved the current health crisis. Health workers have been on strike for 10 days, demanding a pay rise and better wrking conditions.Bedzimba said development has slowed down because of &ldquo;the looting spree&rdquo; in government. &ldquo;We should all start campaigning against corruption because we cannot move forward if we all perpetuate graft,&rdquo; he said.Awiti, Joho&rsquo;s rival, said, &ldquo;Every leader, including MPs, the President and governors, should protect our money. This is what our forefathers fought for.&rdquo;
