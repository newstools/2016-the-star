Tension is high at Nation Media Group after the management of the media company announced plans to fire some staff members in January.Head of corporate and regulatory affairs Clifford Macharia said the move to be undertaken in January 2017 will involve reorganization of all operations across the group.The company is seeking to transform into a modern twenty first century digital content company.In a letter to the staff, Macharia said the exercise will involve reorganization of all operations across the group.The measure is aimed at putting priorities on resources and investments in content development, and innovation in line with the emerging ways that new age consumers are consuming media."We are satisfied that this process is beginning to deliver the intended benefits including the digital division recording the fastest growth in 2016. Regretably this will result in a reduction of our workforce through job redundancies." He said in an internal memo."This will allow us to grow our new revenue streams while securing our current print and broadcasting businesses in a much more efficient and effective manner."The media house said the changes will be carried out with due respect to employees and in accordance with the law.It assured customers that it is committed to providing quality programming.This is the second time the media house is laying off staff.
