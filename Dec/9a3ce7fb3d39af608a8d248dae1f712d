Education CS Fred Matiang'i should stop rushing to release exam results as it could lead to errors in scores, a teacher has said.Deputy head teacher Evans Kodak of Star Sheikh Academy in Athi River, Machakos county, said some of the school's results were inaccurate and the school wrote to the Kenya National Examination Council to correct them.Knec has reviewed and corrected some candidates' results, he said.Kodak said the school suspected anomalies after four candidates were awarded XX results in some subjects, despite sitting for all of the exams.'XX' means missing marks.Kodak told the press in his office on Wednesday, &ldquo;We have not received a computer print out from Knec,. The results we have are those we sourced from parents on the phone.&rdquo;Out of the 240 candidates this year, 37 scored 400 marks and above, he said.&ldquo;We hope the number can arise above that. We are still sending messages to Knec for corrections,&rdquo; Kodak added.He said the school was getting corrections from Knec on their candidates who were awarded XX results.Kodak said the examination agency has already made corrections on results of a candidate who initially scored 303 marks.He said they wrote a letter to Knec requesting it to scrutinise the results of Nduhiu Emmanuel Ndoge, index no 12330122010. The school attached the boy's reports for the last internal exam.Kodak said the boy was awarded 407 marks after the scrutiny.&ldquo;We were convinced there were problems in his results,&rdquo; he said.The school has also written to Knec about Charity Kiteto who they believe performed better than the marks awarded.&ldquo;We made a phone call to Knec shortly before 2pm today [Wednesday] and were assured her results will be rectified,&rdquo; Kodak said.He said they have strong convictions that the 34 per cent awarded to Kiteto in Science is not her real marks.&ldquo;She must had scored above that going by her performance,&rdquo; Kodak said.
