The Sh598 million cocaine case against Briton Jack Marian has been withdrawn.A report dated December 12 obtained by the Star says the case has been withdrawn under Section 87 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code.It is copied to the Director of Public Prosecutions and a date for special mention set for December 21 at Kibera law court number 1.&ldquo;Reason behind withdrawal is that we are still waiting for further intelligence reports from Brazil and Valencia,&rdquo; the report reads in part.Marian was arrested after the recovery of cocaine hidden in container MEDU 3333950 on ship the MSC Posetano. The vessel, which ferried the cocaine from Brazil, was furtively sneaked out of the Mombasa port for fear it would be blown up by the authorities. Another vessel, MSC Nicole, which docked on berth 16, was hastily ordered to offload its cargo.Criminal lawyer Cliff Ombeta, who also represents Vicky Goswami, Baktash Akasha, Gulam Hussein and Ibrahim Akasha in a drug trafficking case, said it does not mean the culprits are off the hook yet.He said fresh arrests can be made any time after a thorough probe, witnesses reports and other evidence.Ombeta said the courts must protect human rights and government agencies must do proper research before prosecuting suspects.He said drug cases are very sensitive &ldquo;now that huge and posh vessels are being blown up&rdquo;.
