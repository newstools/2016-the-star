Is President Uhuru Kenyatta a worried man in the face of opposition leaders&rsquo; talks to form the National Super Alliance? Word has it that ongoing talks between Cord leader Raila Odinga and his Amani counterpart Musalia Mudavadi (pictured) to remove Uhuru in 2017 are giving his Jubilee camp sleepless nights. It is said some Jubilee MPs are afraid the Raila-Mudavadi and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka collabo could well send Uhuru home. Corridors is told the ruling party is in a quagmire about how to counter the anticipated massed opposition because Jubilee&rsquo;s plot of using Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba to divide the Luhya vote farther has failed.************It seems the matatu rogue culture will never go away, thanks to the National Transport and Safety Authority, which was created with the hope of bringing sanity on the roads. On the evening of December 5, passengers boarded a Latema Sacco bus (KBZ 617T) from Westlands to town. The fare was 20 bob but en route to town they changed it to 30, and when two passengers were reluctant to pay the crew abused them using unprintable words and shoved them to stop them from alighting, taunting them there is nothing that could be done to them even if reported to the NTSA. Upon reporting to the NTSA, John Muya, deputy director in charge of safety, promised to act. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a small issue that doesn&rsquo;t require stressing us with,&rdquo; he said on December 9 in response to inquiries on how far he had taken the case. Is that kind of attitude what makes matatu impunity emboldened? Your guess is as good as mine.************The director of a company that has been cited for supplying substandard goods to the Ministry of Devolution under the Special Programmes Department has vowed to stall any supplies, following concerns over suppliers&rsquo; capacity to deliver. The company, among five that ministry officials have observed deliver unfit-for-human-consumption goods and delay in delivery, is on a campaign to malign the ministry until they give in to his demands. Ministry officials have been forced to seek alternative suppliers after the company, which has no stock, stores or physical address, failed to deliver goods. The man is using blackmail to intimidate the ministry officials into accepting substandard goods.************A first-term MP from Kakamega has gone into hiding after landing in trouble with some of his supporters. The colourless politician, who hardly speaks in the National Assembly, rode his way into Parliament through relentless begging for support from well-wishers and fundraising. But once elected in 2013, he forgot about all those who stood by him at the hour of need and financed his campaign. The MP abandoned and blocked phone calls from a lady friend who lent him Sh1.7 million.
