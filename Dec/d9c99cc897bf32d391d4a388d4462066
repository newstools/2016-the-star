Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale called the fight stupid. He said no one will win election by fighting.Kaluma was kicked, punched and wrestled to the ground by Ogaga. Trouble started before Raila arrived at the event to mark the second anniversary of former Senator Otieno Kajwang s death in Waondo, Mbita constituency. It escalated after his arrival.Khalwale said such behaviour does not reflect the kind of leadership voters wants. It s embarrassing to us, leaders, and our supporters. We must avoid such non-beneficial acts and focus on changing the lives of those who elected us, he said.Vihiga nominated MCA Ben Ombima condemned the fight, saying it embarrassed the party.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said any form of violence is unacceptable, as it tarnishes the party s image.

We want them to record statements to enable us to carry out investigations, failing which we will enforce the law in dealing with them, he said.Omusanga warned politicians against perpetrating violence, saying they will be dealt with accordingly.But Kaluma and Ogaga said the police are yet to contact them to record statements. Unless I receive official communication from the police, I ll not record a statement, Kaluma said.Ogaga said he will comply once notified. The two said they have reconciled.
