Baringo senator Gideon Moi on Friday welcomed Nakuru nominated senator Paul Njoroge to Kanu following the latter's defection from Jubilee Party.Moi, accompanied by West Pokot senator John Lonyangapuo, said Njoroge's defection was a manifestation of the high level of Kenyan's dissatisfaction with JP.The senator told journalists after a graduation ceremony at Kabarak University that the party was still open to receive more defectors."We in KANU welcome the senator back home. The party is a safe place for everyone," Moi said.Moi maintained that the party will continue strengthening itself ahead of the 2017 general election in efforts to bargain for power.He said that Kanu will continue working with the Jubilee coalition until their term in office expires in 2017."After the said period, the delegates will decide on its fate," Moi said.Njoroge defected to Kanu on Wednesday citing shambolic election of Jubilee Party officials in Nakuru.Read: Controversial senator Njoroge defects to Kanu over Nakuru Jubilee Party poll chaosAlso read: Fracas disrupts Jubilee interim elections in Nakuru "We are happy to receive one of our own who had gone wandering.
