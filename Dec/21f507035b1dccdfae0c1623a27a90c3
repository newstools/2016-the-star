ODM has sued the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for setting limits on campaign spending. It says this is unfair and discriminatory. The party has filed an urgent application at the Milimani High Court.ODM further told the court the IEBC requirement that all candidates for elective posts appoint authorised persons and form campaign committees is unreasonableThe party argued that the Election Campaign Financing Act 2013, which came into force on December 7 is likely to affect many of its candidates. It said if the court does not intervene, the candidates' right to fair competition will be violated.&ldquo;The decision, if not prohibited or quashed, will affect and or lock out thousands of ODM [hopefuls] who have expressed interest or are yet to express interest for various elective posts,&rdquo; lawyer Antony Oluoch said in court papers.The matter came up before Justice Roselyn Aburili, who directed the lawyer to file the suit papers on the IEBC Immediately.In Gazete notice, IEBC said it had set the limits for political parties in accordance with the constitution, the IEBC Act 2011 and Election Campaign Finance Act 2013.According to the new requirements, political parties are at liberty to receive up to Sh15.3 billion in contributions. But they can only receive Sh3 billion from any single source.The money should be spent between February 8, 2017, and August 8, when the next general election will be held. ODM wants the court to restrain IEBC from enforcing the law saying it was made for an illegal, improper motive and extraneous reasons.ODM says since the law states that any public servant wishing to run for election should resign not later than six months to election, in this case on February 7, to implement the decision would be punitive, selective and discriminatory.Presidential candidates will only be allowed to spend Sh5.25 billion, while candidates for governor, senator and woman representative can only spend a maximum of Sh433 million.MP and MCA hopefuls can spend up to Sh33.4 million and Sh10.3 million respectively. Any political party or candidate who breaks the rules will be fined a maximum of Sh2 million or be jailed for not more than five years or both.
