Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria is proposing a law that will allow Kenyans to defend themselves with lethal force in case of political violence perpetrated by others.Kuria&rsquo;s proposed law is the Stand Your Ground Bill 2017.Among other things, he informs the Speaker that he has borrowed from a US law sometimes called the &ldquo;line in the sand&rdquo;. This is the law one George Zimmerman invoked in his defence after he fatally shot the unarmed Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012, in Florida, USA.Zimmerman was freed on self-defence grounds.Kuria is a man who had hate-speech brought charges against him in court after he led his panga-wielding supporters through Gatundu on July 6, 2015, threatening to exterminate critics of the NYS.What will happen if Kenyans exterminate unarmed individuals, even on the basis of nothing but paranoid suspicion, and then promptly plead self-defence?Given Kuria&rsquo;s very aggressive record, shouldn&rsquo;t Kenyans be preparing to prevent, rather than respond to, election violence?
