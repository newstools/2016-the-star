Kenyans have been advised to be wary of politicians who keep off development projects only to rush at the last minutes to bribe voters.Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro said such politicians only visit their constituencies months to elections, dishing out cash and engaging in numerous fund raisings.He blamed voters of electing such people in office, because of their money and ignoring others who participate in development projects.&ldquo;These people set money aside and wait for the electioneering period so as to bribe voters by attending numerous fundraisers, where they donate millions and people praise such new entrant claiming the others have gone broke,&rdquo; Ethuro said.He spoke on Sunday during a fundraiser at Karatina ACK Church, Nyeri county. Ethuro urged politicians to preach peace, saying they are to blame for violence during elections."In 2008, I was the chairman of the Amani Forum and I went round the country apologising to internally displaced persons and Kenyans in general on behalf of the political class. We promised ourselves that we should never kill or die because of elections,&rdquo; he said.Ethuro urged church leaders to be in the forefront in condemning people engaging in abusive and divisive politics.Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe, who hosted Ethuro, said Kenyans would like to have one united nation.He urged residents, especially the youth, to register in large numbers as voters.&ldquo;Anybody among us without a vote is not different with those in the opposition. The secret of beating our opponents is ensuring we register as voters. Our big number cannot help without votes,&rdquo; Kagwe said.He told the opposition to appreciate the government&rsquo;s efforts in fighting corruption."The fact that only Jubilee governors have been facing impeachments and the majority of them have appeared before the Senate committees to answer to corruption allegations, is a clear indication the party is committed to fight graft," Kagwe said.He criticised Cord for defending suspected corrupt governors.
