Suspended former Athletics Kenya treasurer Joseph Kinyua has expressed his gratitude after being cleared of allegations of subverting anti-doping processes.International Athletics Associations Federation (IAAF) appointed investigator Sharad Rao, in a report the IAAF said there was no evidence to uphold a case against the Athletics Kenya (AK) Eastern Branch chairman.Kinyua was initially suspended for 180 days which were doubled as Sharad sought for more time to compete his investigations. &ldquo;I am overjoyed after receiving the information from the IAAF alerting me that investigator Sharad Rao has completed and submitted his report to IAAF clearing me of doping suppression and extortion of money from athletes,&rdquo; said Kinyua. &ldquo;The allegations had no basis whatsoever. Doping offences today are the most damaging as far as the integrity of the sport is concerned and any connection with the vice, real or imagined was eroding my more than 30 years of conspicuously cordial and fruitful relationship with Kenyan athletes.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;The allegations were also soiling my 50 years of honest public service, most of them with young people.&rdquo;On November 30, 2015 the IAAF Ethics Commission provisionally suspended Kinyua alongside the then Athletics Kenya President, the late Isaiah Kiplagat and vice president David Okeyo. Kinyua, however, remains under investigations, alongside Okeyo, over allegations of misappropriating US$500,000 from kit sponsors Nike.
