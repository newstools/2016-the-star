Standard Chartered Bank, the country&rsquo;s fourth largest lender by market share, says its biometric account access technology is more secure than passwords. The technology, dubbed Touch Login, allows clients to access bank account balances, cards and investments using fingerprints rather than passwords The launch follows successful pilots in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and India mid this year. &ldquo;Fingerprint technology gives our clients more convenience and security. Touch Login uses fingerprints to verify identity, making it more secure than username and password logins,&rdquo; CEO Lamin Manjang (pictured) said. Accessible through the Standard Chartered mobile application, Touch Login will be available on devices with fingerprint sensors including smart-phones, iPhones, tablets and iPads. It is part of the UK-owned lender&rsquo;s Sh152.95 billion ($1.5 billion) investment in its global IT infrastructure last year.&ldquo;We are investing in developing our digital banking solutions to transform client experience,&rdquo; Manjang said.
