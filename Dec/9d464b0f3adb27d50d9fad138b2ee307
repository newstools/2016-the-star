The National Transport and Safety Authority will begin removing all illegal speed bumps in a month. This comes 11 days after 43 people perished at Karai on the Nairobi-Naivasha highway. The driver of a canter carrying inflammable substances lost control after he is said to have hit a speed bump.He rammed into vehicles stuck in traffic before the truck exploded, engulfing 13 vehicles in a fireball. The Motorists Association of Kenya blamed the Naivasha tragedy on the irregular erection of a bump on the road. But Transport PS Irungu Nyakera said the accident may have resulted from the driver&rsquo;s lack of knowledge of the road. President Uhuru Kenyatta warned the Transport ministry and Kenya National Highways Authority against setting up road bumps without proper signage.Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, NTSA director Francis Meja said there have been reports of speed bumps erected in unsafe areas.&ldquo;We will also be removing them,&rdquo; he said. Meja said signposts will be put up. He urged wananchi not to erect speed bumps. &ldquo;Some people are using very unsafe materials to erect speed bumps on the roads. That is very risky and might lead to more harm than benefit,&rdquo; Meja said. Transport CS James Macharia held a meeting with Kenha and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. Meja urged drivers to be cautious during the festive season. He warned them against rushing to make many trips as they cash in on the festivities. Meja said NTSA will put up signposts before black spots. According to the NTSA, Rift Valley has 12 black spots, the greatest number in any region.The black spots on the Naivasha-Nakuru highway include Camp, Salgaa-GSU, Kinungi, Gilgil junction, Njoro Road junction, Ngata Bridge-Sobea and Maili Mbili.
