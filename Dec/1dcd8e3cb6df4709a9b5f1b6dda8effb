Cord has suspended its New Year planned protests to await the Senate&rsquo;s final decision on the contentious election laws.The coalition had called for mass action on January 4 to protest changes to the electoral laws, after it failed to block their passage in the National Assembly last week.&ldquo;We have agreed that mass action be withheld and see what the Senate comes up with. Immediately after the Senate resolution we will be meeting as the Cord family to chart a way forward on whatever will be passed by the Senate,&rdquo; Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka said yesterday.On Thursday last week, despite acrimony and protests from opposition MPs, Jubilee-aligned legislators used their &lsquo;tyranny of numbers&rsquo; majority to push through the changes, a move that has been roundly condemned by political players, religious leaders, civil society groups and other stakeholders as unprocedural and done in bad faith.The Bill was referred to the Senate as some changes touch on the counties. It has been referred to the Senate Legal Committee for public hearing. The team is scheduled to table the report on January 4.Cord co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula said the proposed changes to the election laws had been introduced by &ldquo;evil hands&rdquo; keen on manipulating and bending the law to give room to election rigging.&ldquo;For us in Cord we want Kenya to move away from elections of potency and arguments. This can be done by having a free and fair atmosphere and with an IEBC that recognises that every vote has a meaning and counts,&rdquo; he said.The Ford Kenya leader praised the Senate for rejecting a police cordon, saying it is proof that Parliament is not an appendage or a subordinate of the Executive.He warned that Cord will reject unjust or underhand changes to the electoral laws that make polls untenable.Siaya Senator James Orengo urged Kenyans to resist any clawback of the election laws as passed by both Houses and signed into law by the President.&ldquo;In any democracy laws must be definite, predictable with a certain degree of stability,&rdquo; he said.Yesterday, an NGO moved to court to stop the planned demonstrations by Cord and Jubilee supporters over the election laws.The International Policy Group wants the court to declare the right to picket in the current circumstances is unlawful.
