Once again, we celebrate the birth that changed the world. We Christians believe that on this day, God sent his son for our salvation. But many who are not Christians celebrate with us the message of hope and reconciliation that Christmas brings.It is a good moment, then, to ask whether we have been worthy of this great gift. All of us, if we look deep into our hearts, will accept that we have not always maintained the highest standards this year. All of us, if we look deep into our hearts, will see that we could have been better fathers, better mothers, better sons and daughters, and better Kenyans.But Christmas reminds us that there is time for rebirth; that there is time for reconciliation.That is the message of hope that I ask Kenyans to take with them into the New Year. As you travel to meet family and friends this Christmas, I ask you to take the greatest care on our roads. My government will do all it can to enforce the rules of the road, so that we can all celebrate in safety with those we love.When we gather to celebrate the day, I ask you to reconcile what remains unreconciled. I ask you to recommit yourselves to the healing and uplifting of this nation. And I ask you to resolve to be your brother's keeper in the New Year.That New Year will be an important one. We will choose our leaders, exercising rights for which our fathers fought. Let us honour their memory by exercising these rights in a spirit of grace and peace.May God bless you, and your families and loved ones, in the New Year. And many God guide the Republic and all its leaders in 2017.
