Kisumu MCAs on Tuesday nullified the suspension of Clerk Philip Adundo, saying it was unprocedural. He was suspended by Speaker Ann Adul on December 1 for alleged misappropriation of funds. The motion was moved by Samuel Ombogo, who accused the speaker of working with the executive to interfere with the assembly&rsquo;s operations. Awasi MCA Fanuel Aim asked why the assembly is always changing clerks. He said the speaker suspended Adundo for personal interest without consulting members. On December 2, the executive seconded Alcoholic Drinks Control director Benson Opiyo to act as clerk.
