National carrier Kenya Airways will increase capacity on the Nairobi-Mombasa route on December 23 and 24, and between January 2 and 3 to cater for increased demand by domestic holiday makers thronging the coastal beaches. The loss-making airline yesterday said it will deploy the Boeing Dreamliner 787 which has a capacity of 234 seats. The aircraft will more than double the seats during the period. Embraer, which plies the route, has 96 seats. &ldquo;We have seen increased demand on the Mombasa route ahead of the festive season,&rdquo; marketing and communications director Chris Diaz said in a statement. &ldquo;Kenya Airways plays a major role in boosting the economy of Mombasa during the festive season when demand mainly driven by the domestic market increases.&rdquo; The airline, which normally operates 10 flights on the Nairobi-Mombasa route, said there is increased booking on the Kisumu route. Hoteliers at the Coast said they expect occupancy for most beach hotels, cottages, villas, budget hotels, apartments and other accommodation facilities to reach 90 per cent during Christmas into the New Year.
