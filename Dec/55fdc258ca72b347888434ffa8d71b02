Kenya made several high-profile ivory seizures in 2013 and 2014, and the ivory is usually securely stored to be used as evidence.Elephant poaching across Africa peaked in 2011 but remains "unacceptably high", according to the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants Programme (MIKE), which is supported by the Convention on International Trade in Endangers Species (CITES).Well-armed criminal gangs kill elephants for tusks and rhinos for their horns, and the parts are often shipped to Asia for use in ornaments and medicines.In 2013, the government imposed stiffer penalties - longer jail terms and bigger fines - on anyone convicted of poaching or trafficking in wildlife trophies, saying poaching was harming tourism, a major foreign exchange earner.In February, the government replaced senior managers at the port to try to tackle drug and ivory smuggling.Read: Mombasa the new transit route for ivory smugglers
