A Sh200 million investment is in jeopardy after squatters invaded land bought by three Italian investors in Kwandomo, Magarini constituency.The investors bought 10 acres for Sh50 million in a prime area along the Malindi-Lamu road. They wanted to put up a modern shopping mall with shops, restaurants, luxurious residential houses and a swimming pool.However, when they started developing the site through Alirima Point Ltd, they were threatened and told not to step on the land, yet they have all ownership documents.Alirima director Luca Rizzato yesterday lodged a complaint with the National Land Commission, which is hearing land disputes at the Malindi deputy county commissioner&rsquo;s office.Speaking to journalists after meeting the NLC commissioners led by deputy chairperson Abigael Mukolwe, he said the project would create permanent employment for more than 100 residents.&ldquo;We believe at the end of the project, there will be 60 permanent employees at the mall and 40 permanent ones at the restaurant. The project shall help promote tourism and build the economy,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Rizzato showed journalists the architectural design and urged the government to intervene.He said the squatters, with the help of an MCA, built houses on the land and always turn violent whenever the investor comes.The investor, who represents two other partners in Italy, said it has been difficult for him to access the land he bought genuinely.Mukolwe said the case is among four others the commission is hearing in Malindi.She said squatters who have invaded private property will not be tolerated."Anyone who invades public or private property and builds, all the properties will be brought down. It is sad that the Italian has all the documents, including the tittle deed, but quatters have invaded the land,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mukolwe said.
