Political parties who have presented their campaign teams after December 8 deadline have suffered a blow. This follows a decision by high court judge Joseph Onguto barring the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from receiving forms or names of team to represent the campaign for political parties submitted past deadline. His orders are temporary.Justice Onguto, said that pending the hearing of the petition filed by Nancy Auma the commission should not process any forms received after 8 December 2016. Auma in her suit papers had said that section 6 of the election campaign Financing Act of 2013 provides for deadline for the registration of authorized persons to be in charge of regulating the election campaign, the said deadline was to last for eight months before the general elections. The powers to extend deadline is vested in the Speaker of the National Assembly and not the commission, she said. The case will be heard on December 29.
