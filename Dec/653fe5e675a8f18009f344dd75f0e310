The list was compiled after a rigorous day-long exercise that brought together coaches and captains from all the 16 KPL clubs and eight representatives from the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya. In a departure from last year when SJAK made the selections, this year s exercise involved the journalists, coaches and captains. KPL logistics manager Frank Okoth explained that the format was changed simply to provide for more inclusion. It has been a long day because we had a lot more nominations to consider and tally. Remember we changed the nomination format to allow for better inclusion, and I think we have come down to the five most outstanding players in each category, he said.
