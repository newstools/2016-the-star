Nyandarua Senator Muriuki Karue (pictured) on Sunday said he is the remedy for runaway corruption and other social and political ills that bedevil the county. He said if Nyandarua residents elect leaders who are willing to fight corruption, they will defeat the scourge. &ldquo;I want to assure you corruption can be eliminated. Yes, it can be done,&rdquo; he said. Karue spoke in Ol-Kalou town, where he read the Auditor General&rsquo;s report for the 2014-15 financial year to a handful of residents. He declared he will run for governor at the 2017 polls.
