President Uhuru Kenyatta has criticised the opposition for planning to change the Constitution to create more positions after next year&rsquo;s election.He said the proposed National Super Alliance is focused on changing the Constitution to satisfy the whims of a few people for personal gain.Speaking in Busia, the President said Kenyans are interested in policies that change their lives through development.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t change the Constitution like clothes or because two or three people are not satisfied. How can we continue talking about changing the Constitution every year?&rdquo; Uhuru said.On Tuesday, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said if elected President next year, he will change the Constitution. He said he will within six months create the position of Prime Minister and reintroduce assistant minister posts by creating the positions of Deputy Cabinet Secretaries.But Uhuru dismissed the suggestion, saying devolution is working and all Kenyans need to do is support the new system of government to reap maximum benefits.Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura, a member of Uhuru&rsquo;s Jubilee Party, has introduced a Bill in the Senate to reduce the number of counties to 46.Gitura wants Nairobi stripped of its county status. Instead, he wants the city to be an administrative unit managed by a CS appointed by the President.Uhuru urged opposition leaders to spare Kenyans the destructive politics &ldquo;they perpetuate every election year&rdquo;. He said the opposition should engage in issue-based politics and recognise that political rivalry is not the same as enmity.Uhuru urged politicians to stop inciting Kenyans. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give Kenya a chance to stabilise,&rdquo; he said.The President addressed rallies in Busia, Malaba, Adungosi and during several stopovers in the county. He said Kenya will progress when all its citizens unite and push in the same direction.Deputy President William Ruto said the opposition has refused to accept the reality that the Jubilee administration has achieved more than they could imagine.&ldquo;They have eyes but cannot see. They have ears but cannot hear. They carry heads but don&rsquo;t use them,&rdquo; he said.Ruto said Kenyans will have a clear choice in 2017 because the contest will be between the action-oriented Jubilee and the opposition, which only has stories to tell.
