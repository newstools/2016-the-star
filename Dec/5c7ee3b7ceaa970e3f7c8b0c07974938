The National Construction Authority has said it has no powers to arrest contractors and owners who defy orders to suspend construction.NCA chief executive Daniel Manduku yesterday told the parliamentary committee on Transport that the authority is unable to stop the construction of substandard buildings.Manduku said the police are to blame for not enforcing orders from the NCA confirming buildings risk collapse and are marked for demolition. There is need to amend the NCA Act to define fines for the offences committed. Currently our work is to write to the police to enforce the orders, Manduku said.He was responding to the National Assembly Transport committee s inquiry into the collapsed 10-storey building in Kisii that killed 10 people.The committee, chaired by Starehe MP Maina Kamanda, took to task Manduku and Housing and Urban Development PS Aidah Munano to explain why they always explain measures undertaken to curb the collapse of buildings after a disaster. Why is it that you engage in blame games after people have died? Kamanda said. Munano said the ministry has come up with a draft Built Environment Bill to address loopholes in construction laws and end tragedies in the housing sector.The bill is before the Cabinet for approval to be forwarded to the Attorney General for scrutiny and publication.
