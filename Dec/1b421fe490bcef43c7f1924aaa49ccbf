Zenotek&rsquo;s CEO Carol goes to the Chicago branch, which is run by her brother Clay. Carol&rsquo;s agenda is to lay off staff, cut bonuses and cancel the office Christmas party. To keep the branch as it is, Carol dares Clay to sign financial mogul Walter Davis as their new partner. Clay and his staff decide to throw an amazing Christmas party that will convince Davis to partner with them. The film doesn&rsquo;t bring much new to the table. The star-packed cast offers decent performances that somehow overshadow the crude, silly plot. Star Rating: 2/5
