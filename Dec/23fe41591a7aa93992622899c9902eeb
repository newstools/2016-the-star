Two women nominated MCAs exchanged blows on Thursday in the Migori county assembly over an impeachment motion against Governor Okoth Obado.The two leaders from Suna West and Rongo constituencies were arguing over the proposed motion to remove Obado from office, when they attacked each other.&ldquo;The two were seated side by side during a plenary session at the assembly, when they started exchanging blows, bringing the session to an abrupt end,&rdquo; an MCA told reporters, who were blocked from entering the assembly.Speaking outside the assembly, acting speaker Boaz Okoth said they fought over the impeachment motion, but said he wasn&rsquo;t present.Okoth said the motion is yet to be tabled at the assembly, but rumours have been going round in social media of the impending move.On Wednesday, MCAs were forced to go into kamukunji at the assembly grounds after the governor failed to answer their queries about budget use and implementation.On Thursday, MCAs summoned all nine county executives to explain why some projects have stalled and why most did not follow the proposed budget passed by the assembly. &ldquo;They did not turn up as they requested for more time to have conclusive answers,&rdquo; Okoth said.South Sakwa MCA Jared Osawa said the impeachment motion was already picking up pace and 46 members out of 63 have signed the petition.&ldquo;We have cases of corruption and ghost projects in Migori county. We can&rsquo;t point out what the Sh21 billion given since devolution started has been spent on,&rdquo; Osawa said.
