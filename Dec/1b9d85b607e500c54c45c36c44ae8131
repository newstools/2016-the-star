Former Anglican Bishop Eliud Wabukala has said he is ready to head the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.Wabukala said he is grateful to President Uhuru Kenyatta for nominating him, adding that there were so many qualified Kenyans to serve in the position.He spoke to journalists in his Butonge village in Sirisia constituency. Wabukala said as the process is still in Parliament, he hopes the process will be guided by the Holy Spirit and God&rsquo;s grace. &ldquo;I am humbled by the nomination,&rdquo; the cleric said.He said Kenya needs everyone, regardless of one&rsquo;s commuity, status or political, social and economic class, to pray for the country.Wabukala said God loves Kenya and will stand with the country to move it to greater heights. He said he cannot reveal more on the details of the job until he is vetted.Wabukala urged Jubilee and Cord leaders to agree on electoral law changes to avoid violence. &ldquo;I urge religious leaders to come together and pray for politicians and the country at large to get the right insight to lead this country with a lot of sobriety ahead of the elections,&rdquo; he said. Wabukala said the political temperature in the country is high and leaders are only chest thumping and regarding themselves better than others, which is a dangerous thing for the nation.Bungoma leaders, led by Bungoma woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi and county assembly speaker John Makali, have praised Uhuru for nominating Wabukala. They said they hope the cleric will serve the country diligently.In October, the Public Service Commission shortlisted six candidates for the position of chairperson at the EACC. They were Wabukala, William Kirwa, Philemon Mwaisaka, Peter Ondieki, Rose Osoro and Erastus Iguna.
