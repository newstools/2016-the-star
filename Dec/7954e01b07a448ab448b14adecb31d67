Christmas came early for children living at Upendo Children&rsquo;s Home in Kambirwa, Murang&rsquo;a county, after woman representative Sabina Chege donated food.Hundreds of elderly people and other vulnerable persons from the village thronged the home and also benefited from the bounty.The event &ndash; The Chapati Forum &ndash; set the celebratory mood in the village as a host of volunteers prepared the foods.Chege said it is important for Kenyans to remember the less fortunate during the festivities.She said The Chapati Forum gave a chance for the disadvantaged to come together and make merry. &ldquo;As a society, we need to learn to take care of our elderly because they brought us up and served our country in their youth,&rdquo; Chege said.Sh e said she is planning to organise similar events and has a target of reaching out to at least 1,500 vulnerable persons before the festive season is over. Chege said she will construct four houses for needy families that she has identified that are living in dehumanising conditions.
