Residents of Bomet engaged police in running battles on Tuesday during protests against the gruesome murder of a young boy at the town.Chaos erupted after irate residents attempted to torch the furniture shed where the body of the 12 year-old was discovered.The body had bruises on the neck, which the protesting residents claimed were signs that the boy was strangled.The group assaulted a man, working at the said furniture store, on accusations that he had information on the boy's death.The man was rescued by police and was admitted to Longisa hospital with serious injuries from the mob beating.Bomet OCPD Samson Rukunga calmed the residents. He told them that swift action will be taken to unravel the boy's death.He also warned the members of the public against taking law into their hands and instead asked them to leave the matter to the police."Directing your vengeance towards private property is wrong.
