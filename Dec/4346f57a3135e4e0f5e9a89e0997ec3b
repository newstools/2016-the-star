Players in the oil industry have asked the government to crack down on rogue cooking gas businesses to safeguard the market and ensure safety ofKenyans. The Petroleum Institute of East Africa on Wednesday said illicit refilling of Liquefied Petroleum Gas is still rampant, exposing Kenyans to danger while denying genuine players revenues. People go stealing cylinders from formal players, refill them illegally without paying taxes, then sell at a lower price to the consumer. The process is not properly done, so the cylinders have the chances of exploding and causing accidents, PIEA chairman Powell Maimba said.The institute has named Nairobi as the most notorious in the business followed by Kiambu. Other major towns are Nakuru, Eldoret and Busia. Maimba said though the government has stepped up the war against the illegal gas business, it is still thriving. Some of these individuals are known but they shift. They are like a virus. You find them today, they close, and re-invent into mobile refilling, he said. Oil marketers presented a report and a list of illegal gas dens to the Energy Regulatory Commission in October, indicating 70 per cent of the LPG market has gone rogue .The companies, which sell their products mainly at petrol stations, have accused the police and the judiciary of letting culprits go scot-free.MPs and top government officials are among those said to be behind the lucrative business. It may take time, but as an industry we will continue putting pressure on the government and enforcing agencies, Maimba said. Rogue businessmen refill branded gas cylinders from major companies.
