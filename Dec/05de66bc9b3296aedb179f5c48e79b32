Parliament's special sitting on Thursday turned chaotic after Cord MPs walked out while Jubilee's passed contentious election laws.The legislators were expected to make major changes to the use of technology in the general election, at the session called by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi on Tuesday.Wetangula, who is a co-principal of the opposition's Cord coalition, walked out of the chambers claiming some Jubilee legislators were armed and ready to attack them."We have information that some Jubilee MPs came into the chambers carrying guns; this is against House standing orders. For their own security, MPs decided to leave the chambers," he said.Wetang'ula further told the media that the legislators left citing abuse of power by their Jubilee counterparts and the Speaker."Jubilee MPs did not come to debate and it is very sad that our members were attacked on Tuesday night yet no action has been taken," he said.Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo said Muturi abused his powers on Tuesday when he called today's special sitting to discuss amendments to elections laws."The Speaker has outrightly abused his powers because he is only allowed to call a special session when something is urgent and related to a state of emergency, appointment to commissioners and impeachment of a president, his deputy or declaring war yet non of these are before us," he said.He added: "We have information that Jubilee MPs were instructed to use the most lethal and unreasonable approaches to ensure the amendments pass but what they are doing will haunt them for a very long time because it is affecting the lives of Kenyans."The Cord MPs further criticised the move by the government to deploy police officers outside Parliament buildings saying they were harassing journalists, even inside the premises."It is very sad that the security officers resorted to harassing the media. I am told one journalist has been arrested and a video he had recorded deleted before he was released. This is absurd," he said.Read: Police seals off Parliament again ahead of today's special sittingThe MPs seek to change the law to give room for the IEBC to use other means of identification of voters and transmission of results where technology fails.The issue has already pitted President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party against the Opposition led by Raila Odinga.[VIDEO] Parliament buildings blockaded by police, MPs forced to walk ahead of IEBC sittingAmong the laws the MPs passed was a proposal by Majority leader Aden Duale for MCA candidates to have a minimum of a degree by 2022.Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chpkonga had proposed that the IEBC finds an alternative mechanism for identification and transmission of election resurrects in the event of technological failure.He had also proposed that all independent candidates submit names and photos they intend to use in the elections just like those who will be vying under different parties.The MPs also passed a law concerning Election Campaign Financing Act 2013.
