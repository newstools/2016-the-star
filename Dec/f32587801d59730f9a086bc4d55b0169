Depositors of the collapsed Imperial Bank will receive the third tranche of the remaining deposits in their accounts, the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation has said.KDIC said in a statement that the disbursements commenced yesterday through mid-tier NIC Bank.The parastatal said verified depositors will access additional funds of up to a maximum of 10 per cent of their remaining deposits, subject to a &ldquo;minimum of Sh200,000 or the actual deposit amount for balances below Sh200,000&rdquo;.KDIC took over as receiver manager for Imperial Bank on October 13, 2015 initially for a year following appointment by the Central Bank. This was on October 4 extended by six months to give room for an &ldquo;appropriate resolution strategy&rdquo; for the collapsed lender.&ldquo;Verified depositors will be able to access these funds through NIC Bank as was the case for the second disbursement in July 2016,&rdquo; KDIC said.The second disbursement in July of up to Sh1.5 million per depositor was also made through NIC Bank after the High Court lifted an order suspending the payments which were to begin in June."Depositors who have claimed in the past will not be required to fill in any claim form as their available funds will be paid into their NIC Bank accounts, same as in the last tranche," KDIC said.Depositors who will be claiming their funds for the first time are required to present their claim forms by January 31.Completed forms should be delivered to any NIC Bank branch or four of the Imperial Bank's 28 branches. The branches are Diani, Kilifi, Malindi, Watamu and Parklands.&ldquo;All IBL borrowers should continue making payments on their loans as is currently required,&rdquo; it said.The payment comes five weeks after former directors of Imperial Bank accused the Central Bank and KDIC of placing the bank into receivership without the lawful authority, in a case yet to be determined by the court. They have argued that CBK did not have a fully constituted board in October last year when the bank was placed under receivership. KDIC said the recovery of IBL loans will continue, which will allow access to additional resources by depositors and other stakeholders.
