The Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement is confusing people and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua should fold it and join Jubilee, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has said.He spoke on Wednesday at Tawa town, Makueni county, during President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s tour of the region.&ldquo;Mr President, we have so many leaders who ditched Wiper and joined Jubilee so that we speak with one voice. We do not want other parties within Jubilee to confuse people,&rdquo; Sonko said.&ldquo;So Governor Mutua, if you are branded a Jubilee mole then you have to make a decision and join the party that is uniting Kenyans under the leadership of President Kenyatta and DP William Ruto&rdquo;.Mutua who was elected on a Wiper ticket has said he will seek re-election on his new party. He said the party will field candidates in all elective positions except that of the President.Mutua was denied an opportunity to address the people at Tawa during Uhuru&rsquo;s tour after he was booed at Makindu.The crowd in Makindu heckled Mutua as soon as he was given the microphone. Ruto then tried to take back the microphone, but Mutua adamantly made a hurried speech.While in Tawa, Uhuru cautioned leaders against divisive politics.Three days before Uhuru&rsquo;s tour, Mutua pitched camp at Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana&rsquo;s backyard to popularise his party.He accused Wiper of hiring goons to disrupt his rallies after he was heckled at Makindu town when he opened an office for Maendeleo Chap Chap, a claim Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr, denied.Uhuru and Ruto toured Ukambani, which is considered a Wiper stronghold, to launch projects and hunt for the Kamba vote.Wiper defectors were in the tour, including MPs Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Rachael Nyamai (Kitui South) and Katemi Makenga (Kaiti). Former Tip Tip leader Kalembe Ndile was also present.
