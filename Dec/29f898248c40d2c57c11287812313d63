A group of 40 youths in Mpeketoni area of Lamu county have initiated an irrigation project that is slowly turning lives in Lamu county .The 10 acre project was initiated by Jubilee Youths group and cost the county government of Lamu Sh. 4 Million .Already after two months the site has turned from the once bushy and dry area to a green farm with different products that are being sold to the market thanks to technology.Lamu county is among the counties affected by drought and famine with approximately 32,000 affected by household.Boith Lamu east and Lamu west have highly been affected and the county government requires intervention to help the victims.To Mitigate the disasters the county thought of a long term measure of addressing the problem that has proved successful.The 40 group members used the funds to drill wells, clear the thickets and subdivide the 10 acres to individual pieces .Each person had the responsibility of planting and irrigating their portions and the crops are now at harvesting stage.They planted Maize, tomatoes, onions, pepper, spinach, water melons, bananas, pepper among other crops.On Monday Lamu County Governor Issa Timammy , his deputy Eric Mugo and senior officials from the Department of agriculture toured the area termed the project a success.Timammy said the Jubilee youth group expect a bumper harvest from their farm despite the fact that the area was dry.Speaking in an interview the governor said they require over Sh. 400 Million to set up 100 such projects so as to address the famine disaster.&ldquo;The national government, national Drought Management Authority, should bring funds to initiate such projects , we cannot wait to be given relief , for long term purposes we need funds to initiate more irrigation projects,&rsquo;&rsquo; he saidHe also urged Kenya power and lighting company to supply electricity to all rural areas to help in making real the idea of a 24 hour economy in the country.Mugo the deputy governor said the secret to the success of the project was to give every one responsibility in the group.He said many projects were failing because of group work which makes some people relax.&ldquo;Every one was given his portion, and they are working day and night to ensure they succeed, the group has even incorporated family members to work with them,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Currently Mugo said over 300 people were working in the project with a vision to get bumper harvest.Samuel Njoroge the Jubilee Youth group chairman said the process of setting up the land to its current state was tough.At first he said they were 40 but 10 left the group due to the hardship of preparing the land .If properly facilitated he said they will be able to feed not only Lamu counties but even other counties in the region.Ends
