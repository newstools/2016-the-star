KCB Group, Kenya&rsquo;s largest lender by market share, says the recently concluded Bankika Ushinde promotion helped grow the product&rsquo;s loans to businesses by 135 per cent, while personal loans rose by a quarter. The promotion, which saw 800 winners receive cumulative cash prizes of about Sh5.75 million, was part of the bank&rsquo;s plan to promote financial inclusion among the youth, most of whom are unbanked.&ldquo;As part of our deliberate investments towards supporting the youth agenda, we have anchored our growth strategy on providing a targeted one-stop shop financial that is formed around a digital finance,&rdquo; KCB marketing and communications director Angela Mwirigi said in a statement. He said that the bank plans to increase its youth facilities in the coming year by rolling out a series of targeted financial solutions to nurture a youth saving culture riding on its revamped digital platform. &ldquo;The youth are the future and we are glad that we are playing a positive role in promoting a savings culture among the young people,&rdquo; said Mwirigi. As part of its youth agenda, the bank has sponsored reality TV show KCB Lion&rsquo;s Den, the first of its kind in Kenya, targeting entrepreneurs who have good business ideas with a concrete business plan, and those who have an established business but need to raise funds.
