Mvita MP Abdulawamad Nassir has said he will vie for Mombasa governor in 2022.He spoke during the signing of a deal between the Mvita CDF and the Technical University of Mombasa to build hostels worth more than Sh40 million. Nassir said he fits the bill. TUM acting VC Leila Abubakar said the agreement will decongest the hostels.Nassir cautioned leaders against stopping projects started by their predecessors. He said most leaders think continuing with such developments will earn credit to the predecessors instead of them. &ldquo;This amounts to mediocrity. The service we are offering is for those who placed us to power, not to raise our status,&rdquo; the MP said. Nassir said when he took over as MP from Tourism CS Najib Balala, he completed all projects Balala had initiated. &ldquo;We finished setting the KMTC medical wing, building Mvita Boys and Girls. It does not matter who started the project, your work is to complete it,&rdquo; he said.
