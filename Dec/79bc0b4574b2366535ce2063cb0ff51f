OPPOSITION supremo Raila Odinga has worked overtime and in overdrive to both reclaim and retain his Western vote bloc territory. Throughout 2016, he has given the political arena object lessons in aggressively assertive political strategy. In the process, there has been collateral damage, particularly in the form of former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba, the Budalang&rsquo;i MP, and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, the Senator from Bungoma.Western has been the epicenter of the Orange Democratic Movement since 2007 and a mainstay of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy, both of which are led by Raila, since 2013. Raila lost the Presidential elections of both those years and declined to concede twice. In 2008 he joined the Grand Coalition regime that arose from the embers of the post-election violence as Prime Minister and co-principal alongside President Mwai Kibaki.When he again disputed the Presidential poll result, in 2013, he dashed to the Supreme Court, which upheld President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s victory as declared by the IEBC. He denounced the Willy Mutunga court as &ldquo;mahakama bandia (a fake court)&rdquo;, poured scorn on Mutunga and has actively disrespected Uhuru since then.Upping the disrespect ante, this week Raila told the Wiper Party National Delegates&rsquo; Conference that nominated its leader Kalonzo Musyoka as its Presidential candidate that President Kenyatta ought to have been jailed by the ICC in the now collapsed crimes against humanity case against him. Deputy President William Ruto was charged alongside Uhuru and the ICC&rsquo;s case against him too collapsed.It is said there are no permanent friends or foes in politics. And this aphorism is never more resonant than in the run-up to Presidential campaigns in Kenya. When Luhya leaders Cord co-principal Wetang&rsquo;ula and Namwamba, separately, tried to reclaim Western&rsquo;s Luhyaland vote bloc from the former Prime Minister&rsquo;s grip in 2015 and 2016, his vast reaction knocked them out of both ODM and Cord in Namwamba&rsquo;s case and apparently out of Cord in Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s in a slow-motion, still unraveling process.Kalonzo&rsquo;s Presidential candidate endorsement by Wiper on Tuesday stands in the greatest contrast to Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s own ceremony in Kakamega&rsquo;s Muliro Gardens on April 2, 2016. Not only did Raila skip Ford Kenya&rsquo;s endorsement of Wetang&rsquo;ula as Presidential candidate, jetting out to Tanzania for a private visit with President John Magufuli, but ODM supporters disrupted the event and anti-riot police moved in and thoroughly tear-gassed the gathering. It was anything but dignified.Kalonzo&rsquo;s ceremony even had invited guests, two of whom addressed the gathering &ndash; Raila and Mudavadi. And so Wetang&rsquo;ula stands powerfully rebuked and isolated, with Raila bestriding the Western region like the colossus he has been in the area since 2007. Namwamba has taken off on his Third Way Alliance tangent. With his battles to keep the massive Luhya vote bloc intact and lined up firmly behind him, Raila is doing what no other politico has done in Kenyan electioneering history since President Daniel arap Moi&rsquo;s first two multiparty elections, with the crucial difference being that Moi operated from State House as the longest serving incumbent.Raila, whose own Luo vote bloc is beholden to him but ranks only fifth in terms of registered voter numbers and has a patchy history of turnout on Election Day, has maintained such a grip on the Luhya that the case has begun to be made he is a spent force and Western needs to flex its electoral muscles on someone else&rsquo;s behalf, including a unified Luhya candidate.Raila has been such a dominant force in Luhyaland that even in Bungoma ODM was able to take Sirisia for John Waluke in 2013. And although Water and Irrigation CS Eugene Wamalwa&rsquo;s Trans Nzoia backyard&rsquo;s six MPs are majority Ford Kenya (four), one is URP and one is independent, ODM keeps up a steady drumbeat in the region.ODM is also dominant in Kakamega (where Governor Wycliffe Oparanya is one of the foremost Raila backers of all time and is credibly said to have had a hand in the disruption in Muliro Gardens and Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s subsequent isolation) and Busia.Wetang&rsquo;ula has been so badly treated by his fellow co-principals that his chances of becoming the Cord flagbearer have been reduced to the butt of a cruel joke &ndash; there is talk that he is so desperate he might as well run for MCA.MUDAVADI KNOWS HIS LIMITS, JOINS HANDS WITH RAILAMudavadi clearly realizes it will be difficult for him to extend his influence beyond Vihiga and well nigh impossible to extend his reach into Kakamega, hence the enthusiasm with which he has rediscovered and revived his liaison with Raila, a ruthless operative who has reached that point in his life and career that he can only transact with the people who have the numbers.He certainly has the numbers when he tours Western and attracts huge crowds that no other political operative &ndash; including the two incumbents of the Presidency &ndash; are capable of. But can even Raila can pull off the strategy of partnering with both Mudavadi and Wetang&rsquo;ula and at the same time accommodate Kalonzo and Gideon? Some people in this proposed line-up have to fall by the wayside or await the huge political promissory note of NASA winning the Presidential poll followed at a later date by a full-blown National Referendum to create the positions of assistant Deputy President, Prime Minister and two DPMs, and so on and so forth.In 2002, 2007 and 2013 politicos had the luxury of making all sorts of memoranda of understanding. Before 2010, such political promissory notes were so attractive because the constitution-making process was still on. After the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, it is hard to envisage there being a wave among constitutional review-fatigued Kenyans for renewed for re-engineering, unless JP is defeated so massively by NASA that Kenyans ride on that crest of repudiation of all things UhuRuto and amend the Constitution almost unanimously. But this is most unlikely to happen.What will happen instead, and is in all probability unfolding even now, is the signing of secret MoUs such as those that preceded the National Rainbow Coalition. In 2002, MoU1 was the Kibaki-Raila agreement that the law would be changed under the first post-Kanu dispensation to install the younger man as an Executive PM. Kibaki and his handlers trashed this pact the minute they entered office, only to return to it five years later amid the post-election violence that greeted the IEC&rsquo;s announcement of his reelection in 2008.MoU2 was sealed at the Hilton Hotel, with the Opposition finally coming together for the first time in the history of Kenyan electioneering, preceding Raila&rsquo;s historic Tosha endorsement of Kibali in Uhuru Park in October of 2002.After Narc finally vanquished Kanu other MoUs surfaced, including secret pacts witnessed by senior lawyers such as Ambrose Rachier and Njoki Ndung&rsquo;u (years later to become a judge of the Supreme Court). They included the Nairobi Club MoU witnessed by Rachier, after the first signing ceremony at the Hotel Intercontinental aborted. The Nairobi Club MoU is now infamous for having never been seen again after it was inked.And then there was the Hilton Hotel MoU, witnessed by lawyer Ndung&rsquo;u.Fast-forward to 2013 and there was another flurry of MoUs, including the KICC and Laico Grand Regency pacts and the night meetings at Mudavadi&rsquo;s Riverside, Nairobi, residence that culminated in Uhuru temporarily passing the ball to him. This pact was witnessed by Uhuru&rsquo;s lawyer Desterio Oyatsi. Uhuru walked out on this pact, saying the Devil made him pass the ball to Mudavadi.THE MOST HIGH-RISK PRE-POLL POLITICAL POWER PACTS EVERLike the 2002 Kibaki-Raila MoU, NASA is coming together on the basis of things that are not yet in the Constitution. The MoU that Kibaki threw away at least had the virtue of being drawn up just ahead of an earnest constitution-making process, when everybody believed everything was possible.The 2017 MoUs have no room for manoeuvre and are based on an extraordinary presumption of good faith, being crafted in spite of and despite the long and treacherous history of political MoUs in Kenya. They are the most high-risk pre-poll pacts in Kenyan political history.Where the ruling JP has plenty to offer MoU partners, being the power incumbents, including the position of Speaker and posts in both Houses and in Cabinet, Raila has only position to grant and only after the General Election vote and a Referendum vote.
