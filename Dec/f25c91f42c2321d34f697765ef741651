Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has told Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga not to expect being endorsed by Cord co-principal Raila Odinga.He said MPs Oburu Oginga (Nominated) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) are cheating Rasanga and giving him false hopes of benefiting from a direct endorsement in his re-election bid.The National Assembly deputy minority leader said Raila wants free and transparent nominations to avoid a repeat of chaos, which have caused disgruntled party members to shift allegiance.&ldquo;Let Rasanga forget the notion that Raila will lift up his hands for endorsement this time,&rdquo; Midiwo said.He said he has gauged what the public wants.Midiwo was speaking on Wednesday during a morning show on Radio Mayienga FM.He said during a recent party meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, Raila reiterated that every aspirant should jostle for elective positions, and they should not expect his backing.Midiwo said legislators preaching the &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; of endorsement are stumbling blocks towards Raila&rsquo;s presidency.He said "careless utterances will scare out potential voters".&ldquo;There are a few legislators who backbite colleagues with Jakom, rather than consolidate votes for him,&rdquo; Midiwo said.Oburu and Wandayi have strongly supported Rasanga&rsquo;s administration, to the chagrin of MPs from the region, who criticise his government.Midiwo said the public is now informed and ready to make decisions that will shock &ldquo;careless&rdquo; leaders.He cited the 2013 by-election, when a large percentage of voters supported William Oduol, although he lost to Rasanga.&ldquo;We marshalled the support of Cord co-principals Moses Wetang'ula, Kalonzo Musyoka and Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale after Oduol proved to be tough,&rdquo; Midiwo said. He said ODM defeated Oduol with a paltry 3,000 votes.He said he knows Raila better than the self-proclaimed &ldquo;powerful inner circle&rdquo;.Midiwo said Raila is tired of being dragged into "local politics".He said he will either back Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo for governor or Oduol.&ldquo;I will not vote for Rasanga,I will lose with either Gumbo or Oduol or lose with both of them,&rdquo; Midiwo said.
