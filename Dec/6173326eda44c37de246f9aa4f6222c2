Students have protested against the decision that university and college students from Kitui Central must be registered voters to qualify for CDF bursaries.Nason Kilonzo, the president of the Lower Eastern University Students Association, on Thursday demanded that Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu should withdraw the &ldquo;draconian and discriminatory condition&rdquo;.&ldquo;We find this move malicious, ill-advised, cantankerous, vicious, draconian and discriminatory,&rdquo; said Kilonzo in a statement he read to the media at a Kitui hotel.It was also signed by Joseph Musyoka, a student leader from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology and human rights crusader Steve Muumbu.Violates law, students&rsquo; rightsKilonzo said the requirement that bursary applicants be registered voters was a gross violation of the Constitution.&ldquo;We, the university student leaders, youth leaders and human rights activists from Kitui Central do hereby condemn Hon. Makali Mulu for usurping responsibilities that do not belong to him of creating a barrier [to bursaries],&rdquo; he said.No vote card, no bursaryOn Wednesday, addressing about 1,800 university and college students who had gathered at the CDF office to apply for the bursaries, Mulu said producing a voter&rsquo;s card creates accountability.He said it is meant to ward off dishonesty and unfairness.The legislator said some dishonest applicants from other constituencies bribe to be registered as voters in Kitui Central to get bursaries.&ldquo;It is meant to ensure justice, transparency and accountability. We have to invoke due diligence to ensure only students who merit access CDF bursaries. They must provide proof that they are voters in Kitui Central to be entitled to bursary allocation,&rdquo; Mulu said.
