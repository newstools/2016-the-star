COTU boss Francis Atwoli has said that the December 31 rally at Muliro Gardens will go on as planned despite opposition from various quarters.Atwoli said that the preparations for the end year fete were complete and assured those who plan to attend of adequate security.The COTU secretary general said the community's preferred presidential candidate in the 2017 poll will be named at the Kakamega meeting.Atwoli told the Star at his home in Khwisero that he is not interested in national politics but has the zeal to unite the Luhya community."My role is to consolidate the Luhya community vote into one basket...voters from the community are united but leaders divided. It is a high-time we solved the problem," Atwoli said.He said the unveiled candidate will either be mandated to go it alone in the August 8 vote or team up with political outfits that are keen on sending Jubilee home.Atwoli said the preferred politician will be settled upon following the report of a survey conducted by a team of experts from University of Nairobi.Read: Atwoli to name voice of Luhyas, &lsquo;restore unity&rsquo; on New Year&rsquo;s EveAlso read: Don&rsquo;t impose spokesperson on Luhyas, politicians urge AtwoliMore on this: Disrupt rally and face Luhya wrath &ndash; AtwoliThe task force, the COTU boss said, was mandated to come up with recommendations on who is the most popular presidential candidate in Western."This process was fair because the person is not going to be hand-picked. The team will explain how they settled on the candidate," he said.Atwoli cautioned politicians against defying the chosen leader, saying those in opposition to the same will face the wrath of the Luhya community.The organisers told the Star that more than 1,000 youths from the community have been mobilised to guard the venue of the said meeting.Trans Nzoia senator aspirant Ken Wafula, a member of the organising committee, said any attempts to disrupt the meeting will be resisted.Wafula said: "We are fully in support of the initiative by Atwoli. It has the backing on the entire Luhya community that has been yearning to have political direction under one leader,"Butula MP Michael Onyura said the plan may eventually help Western residents to achieve 'the political unity that has been elusive for long'."It is a very good move. If it works well, we will all rally behind the leader who will be named through the process that has been going on," Onyura said."Uniting as a community is not tribal. It will make us have one strong voice to push for issues touching on our people," he said at Huruma primary school, Eldoret on Monday.This comes even as Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and a section of legislators allied to the party opposed Atwoli's plan.Wetang'ula and Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale argued that Atwoli has no mandate to name a spokesman for the community."We want him to tell us who gave him (Atwoli) that mandate. But if he wants to appoint a personal spokesman, that is fine," Wetang'ula said.In response to those opposed to the plan, the COTU secretary general asked the group to stay at home and follow the proceedings which will be broadcast live on television.Amani party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wetang'ula, former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and former Speaker Kenneth Marende are among the Luhya leaders being considered in the choice.The event comes at a time, Mudavadi has revitalised campaigns for his presidential bid and unity of the opposition parties under the National Supper Alliance (NASA).Meanwhile, luhya council of elders, at a press conference in Bungoma, dismissed Atwoli's plan saying that it risks dividing the community.The council's vice chair Burudi Nabwera accused Atwoli of failing to consult them."He has not told the community the platform he is using to undertake such a delicate assignment and who assigned him to do so," Nabwera said.Nabwera, who was flanked by other elders, said it was wrong for Atwoli to hand-pick a presidential candidate from the community."How does he expect those who will not be named to react?" Nabwera asked, citing emergence of leaders such as the late Masinde Muliro and Wamalwa Kijana."They were not hand-picked but emerged following their charisma," the elder's spokesman said, adding that they will not attend the meeting.Close sources to Atwoli said that the COTU boss and his team are scheduled to settle on Mudavadi as the preferred presidential candidate.Eyes are now set on how the decision will go with Senator Wetang'ula following his declaration to bid for president under Cord.
