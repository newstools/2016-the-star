Farmers in Tharaka Nithi have been urged to harvest rain water and not sell their food as the December rains will be inadequate. Meteorological Department director Danson Ireri said the county will experience depressed rainfall, which will be poorly distributed. He spoke to the press at Chuka town on Thursday. Ireri urged farmers to treat water from the river to avoid contracting diseases such as typhoid and cholera. Agriculture Sector Development Support Programme officer in charge of environmental resilience Freshia Mwebia urged residents to rehabilitate water catchment areas. Programme coordinator Collins Marangu said they will vaccinate livestock to prevent spread of diseases. We will be vaccinating animals in all the constituencies to ensure they do not contract diseases, especially now that we expect water shortage, he said.
