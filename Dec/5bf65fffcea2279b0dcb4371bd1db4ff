Breathalysers will soon be used in bars, clubs and other alcohol outlets to curb drink-driving.The county has partnered with the NTSA to station officers at the joints to test blood alcohol levels. &ldquo;Once you are done with drinking and you have a car, you will be tested at the entrance,&rdquo; the county Liquor Licensing Board chairman Vincent Shimoli said.He told the Star yesterday that those who fail the test have to take a taxi or matatu. Their cars will be towed to the county yard. &ldquo;Of course, when they come for their cars they must pay for parking. We cannot keep them for free,&rdquo; Shimoli said. Drink-driving has been blamed for the many accidents in the capital. The NTSA arrests motorists who fail the test. &ldquo;We are also partnering with police and taxi firms to make this a success. Remember, more than 85 per cent of accidents on our roads are caused by human error,&rdquo; Shimoli said.
