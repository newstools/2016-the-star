Nyali MP Hezron Awiti has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to veto the Elections Laws (Amendments) Act 2016 should it be approved by the Senate.Awiti asked Uhuru to heed calls of Kenyans who have demanded the amendment to the election law be rejected.The law was negotiated by a joint parliamentary committee chaired by Senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru).The legislator said that for democracy to prevail, there must be transparency and "a price to be paid"."Just like every other citizens who have rejected the bill, I am ready to pay the price for the bill to be rejected," he said in Mombasa on Wednesday.He said Kenyans will only have confidence in the electoral commission when its activities cease to be shrouded in secrecy and chaos. The lawmaker said that already the country is seized of fears that the August 2017 vote will be rigged, a situation he said might into another post-election violence."Voters are worried whether the general election will indeed be free and fair judging by the manner in which the amendments were made," Awiti said.He said: "Despite lack of a report from the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that adopted the changes, Jubilee used its tyranny of numbers to approve the amendments," Read: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election laws The contention by those opposed to the amendments is that the alternative use of a manual register is recipe for chaos.The Kriegler Commission of Inquiry into the 2007/08 post-election violence recommended major electoral reforms, among them the use of technology in subsequent polls.The chaos at that time left more than 1,300 people dead and over 600,000 internally displaced. Awiti said more and sober institutions like churches and civil groups rejected the amendments and so should the head of state.He made the comments even as the senate ruled that the amendments be subjected to public participation ahead of the January 4 debate.More on this: Ethuro pushes election laws debate to January 4, orders public participation
