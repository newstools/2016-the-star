Some 1,941 children have been adopted by Kenyan families since 2009, Social Services PS Susan Mochache has said. She warned against illegal, informal adoptions. Mochache said child traffickers have taken advantage of informal adoption and warned those caught that the full wrath of the law will be unleashed on them. Follow the law as it will ensure the rights of a child are upheld in the adoption process, Mochache said. She spoke during World Adoption Day celebrations at Karuri Primary School, Kiambaa constituency, Kiambu county, on Tuesday. Area MP Paul Koinange said many people equate child adoption to child buying, leading to stigma. Most Kenyans refer to adopted children mtoto wa kununuliwa. This must change as all leaders, including religious leaders, should start informing Kenyans on formal adoption, he said.
