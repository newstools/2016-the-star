Striking doctors in Nairobi will not receive their December salaries, the county has said. &ldquo;We are not going to pay people who have not worked. The doctors boycotted their duties almost a month ago and the county government came to the decision that they will not pay them as they had not dispatched their services as required,&rdquo; Health executive Bernard Muia said yesterday. He said the strike is illegal. &ldquo;The doctors do not understand health services are completely devolved. We had made a deal with the doctors that included promotions and salary increments and they failed to honour our call to end the strike so they are not genuine,&rdquo; Muia said.KMPDU has said doctors are ready to go for months without pay until the 2013 Collective Bargaining Agreement is implemented. Nairobi branch Secretary Thuranira Kaugiria yesterday said doctors have previously survived six months without pay. &ldquo;The Nairobi government should not threaten us with nonpayment of salaries. We have previously been forced to stay without salary for six months and we were not on strike, so why are they threatening us? If they want to push it up to a year, doctors are ready for that,&rdquo; he said. The doctors want a 300 per cent pay rise. If the CBA is executed, the lowest-paid medic - an intern - would be paid Sh342,000 per month, while the highest would receive Sh940,000. This is inclusive of allowances. The county has said the demands are unreasonable. Currently, the highest-paid doctor receives Sh500,000, while the lowest receives Sh40,000. Consultants at the Aga Khan University Hospital who joined the strike yesterday complained, saying they have been struck off the list of medics for a year. The nationwide doctors&rsquo; strike entered the fourth week yesterday.
