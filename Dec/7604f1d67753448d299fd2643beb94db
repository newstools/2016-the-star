Hundreds of Gatuanyaga residents in Thika East on Wednesday lit bonfires and dug trenches blocking the Thika-Munyu road in protest against its bad condition. They stopped transport in Githima, Komo and Munyu for 10 hours, as they petitioned their MCA Cecilia Wamaitha, MP Alice Ng ang a and Governor William Kabogo to intervene. Led by boda boda riders, they lit bonfires, dug trenches across the road and blocked vehicles. The residents accused leaders of using the road as their campaign tool.They said no leader has fulfilled their promises to fix it back in 2013. They said they no allow the county to collect road levies until it is passable. For the last four years, they have been giving us false promises that they will repair these roads. The governor came here the other day and lied to us he would employ technology they learnt in Israel to make the roads passable and durable. That was mere rhetoric and no action, a resident said. The MP came here and repaired the road using poor quality equipment and workmanship, rendering it worse than it was before. We have appealed to her to come and redo the road, but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, another resident said.
