The Kenya Tourism Board yesterday welcomed plans by the county government to set up the Mombasa Tourism Board.The administration announced it wants to set up a local tourism marketing agency to complement the national government&rsquo;s KTB.Several weeks ago, during a tourism stakeholders meeting with the county government, Governor Hassan Joho said he will push for an executive bill through the county assembly to establish the board.Kenya Tourism Board chairperson Jimi Kariuki yesterday said the Coast has world-class sandy beaches, making it one of Kenya&rsquo;s flagship tourism products.&ldquo;Marketing the Coast tourism product from a national and local level will further support the acceleration of the region&rsquo;s tourism recovery,&rdquo; Kariuki said.In a statement to media houses, Kariuki said infrastructural improvements within and around the key coastal tourism towns are essential to support the sector and attract tourists (pictured).He said this will enable the KTB to deliver its marketing mandate. He said the concept of having a national tourism marketing agency and a local or regional board is a practice in several top tourism destinations in the world.France, Spain, Italy, Britain, USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all have this concept in place. Kenya Coast Tourists Association chairman Mohammed Hersi and Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers Coast executive director Sam Ikwaye have supported the move.
