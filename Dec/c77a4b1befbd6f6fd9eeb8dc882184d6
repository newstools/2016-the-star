The Jubilee Party elected Kwale interim officials in a boardroom agreement that was not marred by chaos
like it has been in other regions. Governor Salim Mvurya's camp and that of woman representative
Zainab Chidzuga settled on Alhaji Kizeru as chairman. Another 19 officials were elected. Former TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo, who was returning officer, praised supporters for maintaining
peace throughout the process.
