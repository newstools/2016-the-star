EAPCC land is not up for sale, Athi River deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding&rsquo; said yesterday.Last month, EAPCC chairman Bill Lay said the company plans to sell part of its 13,000 acres in Mavoko to help it return to profitability. The company planned to raise about Sh8 billion.During Jamhuri Day celebrations on Monday, Omoding&rsquo; said some NLC officials are colluding with cartels to grab East African Portland Cement Company land.He also accused some EAPCC officials of helping cartels grab the company&rsquo;s land.Omoding&rsquo; urged NLC officials to protect public, private and community land &ldquo;instead of helping cartels grab it&rdquo;.&ldquo;We will expose people helping to grab land and forward their names to the authorities,&rdquo; he said.Omoding&rsquo; said many Kenyans have been conned after the EAPCC announced it would sell 2,000 acres at Sh5 million per acre. He said con men have taken advantage of the announcement to sell nonexistent land.&ldquo;Everybody should know the parastatal is not selling any land. It is a scam,&rdquo; Omoding&rsquo; said. A man was recently conned of Sh3 million, he said. Omoding&rsquo; urged Kenyans to do due diligence before buying. He said the EAPCC land is valued at Sh70 million to Sh80 million per acre because it is near the highway.Omoding&rsquo; said residents should buy land with valid title deeds and not accept allotment letters as a substitute.He urged EAPCC directors to resign if they are can&rsquo;t manage the parastatal.He criticised the company for announcing plans to retrench 1,000 workers. &ldquo;The company should be run well so it does not have to retrench employees. Where do you want them to go? If you are defeated with management, go home,&rdquo; Omoding&rsquo; said.EAPCC is the country&rsquo;s third largest cement maker by market share.
