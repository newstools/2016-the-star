EACC has faulted the Tharaka Nithi government on unprocedural transactions. In a corruption risk assessment report, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission shows the running of the county has glaring loopholes.Releasing the report on Wednesday in Kathwana, EACC vice chairperson Sophia Lepuchirit said the county should put in place proper systems to seal irregularity loopholes. She urged the county to implement the recommendations of the report to show they are willing to comply with the law. We want to improve management and accounting systems at the county level. Our work is not to reprimand or embarrass the county leaders, but to improve systems, Lepuchirit said. She said contractors should not be paid before they supply goods and services.She said some of the weaknesses pointed out in the report are in financial management, procurement process and human resource. Lepuchirit said the county engaged casual workers to conduct important transactions, instead of the employed staff.She also said payments were made before vouchers were taken through the normal process and report books did not have stamps and signatures.Lepuchirit said MCAs should sign attendance books when they attend committee meetings.The Tharaka Nithi county assessment was conducted between February and March this year.She said Governor Samuel Ragwa has shown commitment to implement the report s recommendations.Lepuchirit said the commission has more than 600 corruption cases from the counties in court. I sit in that committee and I feel sad that every week we have to sign files to go to court. We have suggested that some cases be taken for administrative action, because we will end up jailing so many people and the government will be paying a lot of money to feed people, Lepuchirit said.
