More than 3,000 squatter families at Sabaki, Magarini constituency on Wednesday accused the National Land Commission of failing to address their plight.The squatters said the commission, chaired by Muhammad Swazuri, took sides with a tycoon claiming ownership of the 315-acre piece of land instead of helping them get tittle deeds.The group said that they have stayed in the area for over 100 years and wondered why NLC did not rely on their original tittle deeds.They said that the tycoon in question presented a title deed which was obtained in the 1990s while theirs was issued in 1906.The squatters vowed not to move out of the disputed land until the matter is resolved, adding that they have lost faith in the commission.Timothy Mwambogo, 70, told journalists that the major problem in Sabaki was land but the government was not keen in helping the thousands of squatters.He said most of the land in the area was allocated to top government officials and provincial administrators at the expense of the locals."Most of the lands in this area are owned by absentee landlords. Upon learning of the real issues, the land commission begun siding with the tycoons," he said.He said the M16 land was allocated to a former administrator who is still serving in government."Documents of this piece of land are mixed up. How can a person who has been in existence for many decades be told to move out of land by a person with documents of 1990s?" he asked. Mwambogo showed the Star a map and the tittle deed through which they are laying claim to the parcel of land.He said successive commissions formed to address the issue have failed to deliver."The national lands commission is being used to intimidate squatters who are the indigenous people," he said.Jonathan Mungumba, chairman of M16 land squatters, said they have been threatened on many occasions to vacate the area.Read: Sabaki group wants to take over ADC landAlso read: Magarini locals ask for alternative landMore on this: State resolving Coast land issues to end use as campaign tool - RutoIn a meeting at Malindi last week, NLC vice chair Abigael Mbagaya said they will not allow squatters to invade private land, adding that the cases are common at the Coast.
