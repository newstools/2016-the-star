Wild animals attacked sheep in Serewo village, West Pokot, on Wednesday night, killing more than 100. Farmer Loketi Koringiro said he woke up to find his sheep&rsquo;s corpses scattered about. &ldquo;It may have been a hyena or a leopard because it sucked blood,&rdquo; he said. The farmers urged the KWS to resolve the human-wildlife conflict in the village, as it has caused panic. &ldquo;We want the KWS to contain the animals because this is a big loss to us. It will be hard for us to pay school fees for our children,&rdquo; another farmer Daniel Kiptoo said. The residents want the government to compensate them and protect them against possible future attacks. &ldquo;We depend on the sheep,&rdquo; Kiptoo said.
