Wild animals attacked sheep in Serewo village, West Pokot, on Wednesday night, killing more than 100. Farmer Loketi Koringiro said he woke up to find his sheep s corpses scattered about. It may have been a hyena or a leopard because it sucked blood, he said. The farmers urged the KWS to resolve the human-wildlife conflict in the village, as it has caused panic. We want the KWS to contain the animals because this is a big loss to us. It will be hard for us to pay school fees for our children, another farmer Daniel Kiptoo said. The residents want the government to compensate them and protect them against possible future attacks. We depend on the sheep, Kiptoo said.
