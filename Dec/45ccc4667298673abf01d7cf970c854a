President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have moved to deal with the growing disquiet over Jubilee Party officials.Ruto announced on Saturday that JP aspirants and elected leaders would meet this week to elect interim officials across all the 47 counties."All Jubilee elected leaders and all aspirants should sit down so that we agree on interim officials in every county who will help us coordinate all activities until we do the party elections after the general election next year," Ruto said.Ruto, who spoke in the Kurgung High School grounds in Mosop, Nandi county, said the party will involve all its supporters in running a fair electoral process and picking leaders who have the people's backing.&ldquo;We want to run a party that is fair to its supporters. Our officials should reflect what our supporters want,&rdquo; Ruto emphasised.The move by the JP leaders comes after creeping disquiet in the ruling party strongholds following announcement of a Presidential campaign team made up mostly of elected leaders.The move has been criticised by some ardent JP supporters, especially aspirants, creating rival camps across the country.The move also comes after Uhuru and Ruto retreated to the Sagana State Lodge a week ago to discuss, among other issues, the upcoming Presidential campaign.During the Sagana retreat, the two were briefed on the various challenges that have faced JP since its launch in September.They resolved to deal with the disquiet by allowing the aspirants and elected leaders to come up with interim officials, instead of waiting until after the general election on August 8.What was thought to be a Cabinet retreat ended up being a two-day Presidency bonding session between Uhuru and Ruto and very close aides.The two resolved that the President focusses on delivery of the Jubilee Manifesto while the DP deals with JP politics ahead of the election.To this end, the President has prepared an intense programme for the month of December, in which he will launch projects in Ukambani, Western Kenya and the Coast.So intense was the bonding in Sagana that only one person was allowed into the "single most important" meeting, according to multiple sources.The President's Private Secretary Jomo Gecaga was allowed into that meeting, though there were others who were briefed during other meetings.It is understood that Uhuru and Ruto also got a brief on the ongoing fundraising for the billions of shillings that the Jubilee Party seeks to raise.It is still unclear what kind of budget JP is seeking to deploy for Uhuru's reelection, where the target is to get at least 65 per cent of all votes.However, insiders claim that there will be at least six to 10 choppers at the Presidential team&rsquo;s disposal when the campaigns kick off next year.In addition, the plan is to have at least five branded four-wheel vehicles in every county, though the various regional teams have been told to come up with this.For Election Day, JP will have at least two agents in every polling station to "safeguard" the Presidential result, especially in Opposition strongholds.The Jubilee Party is allowed to raise and use a maximum of Sh15 billion from February to August next year, while the Presidential campaign can use a maximum of Sh5.2 billion.Sources told the Star that the top two men who comprise the Presidency sat down and drew up a strategy of governance, politics and the youth.The Sagana State Lodge is described as Kenya&rsquo;s Camp David, where President Uhuru retreats when under pressure to brainstorm over the most challenging issues.The Camp David label is borrowed from the country retreat of the US President, located in wooded hills north of the capital Washington, DC, where presidents retreat to when under intense pressure.This was the first time since UhuRuto retreated to the Coast to craft the Cabinet in 2013 that they were spending two consecutive days away from the seat of power without Cabinet and senior government officials present.It was supposed to be a three-day retreat.At the end of the two days, they had three agreements &ndash; a Jubilee projects strategy, a Political Party campaign strategy and a Youth strategy, which will form the three pillars of the 2017 campaigns.When it came to details of the Sagana discussions, Deputy State House Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Nzioka Waita referred us to State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu, who did not respond to our calls.The two are among those who were briefed on the meeting between Uhuru and Ruto.Others said to have held meetings at Sagana with the President include his brother Muhoho Kenyatta, who is handling the Presidential campaign finances.The head of the Jubilee Party Presidential campaign secretariat, Raphael Tuju, also briefed the top two on the progress made so far.Uhuru doubles as Jubilee Party Leader and Ruto as Deputy Party Leader.The President will spearhead the completion of all remaining Jubilee projects and the making of the last national Budget under Jubilee in their first term, expected in March 2017.The President will work closely with the Presidential Delivery Unit and the Presidential Strategic Communication Unit to craft the messaging on Jubilee delivery.The DP will be in charge of Jubilee Party strategy and will engage in the politics, and especially consolidating the gains made in the Opposition strongholds.This includes implementing ideas from the Jubilee Secretariat Presidential campaign.We have established the Sagana meeting agreed to expand the team to take care of numerous complaints.The move is expected to quell the uproar inside Jubilee, following protests against the campaign team.Other interested political aspirants alleged the appointed team had the upper hand in the party and would manipulate the nominations.Ruto&rsquo;s role remains challenging, as the ruling party prepares for the general election.Jubilee is expected to conduct party nominations that might strengthen or weaken Uhuru&rsquo;s reelection vehicle.JP is also expected to continue grassroots registration and selling the government agenda.Gecaga was given the role of developing the youth strategy that includes mobilising all ministries involved on the youth agenda and politically bring together lobby groups under Team Uhuru.
