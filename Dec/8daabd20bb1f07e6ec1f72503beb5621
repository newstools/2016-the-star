Five Kenyan Premier League sides have until mid-day today to re-submit their club licensing application following and extended deadline by the Football Kenya Federation.The five include Western Stima, Muhoroni Youth, Sony Sugar, Sofapaka and Thika United. Nzoia Sugar, who have been promoted by virtue of topping the just concluded Nationwide League, are also yet to resubmit their papers.FKF president Nick Mwendwa said there will be no way around the requirements since: &ldquo;The rules are now entrenched in our constitution thus a matter of statutes. They are mandatory.&rdquo;The deadline was extended after some clubs failed to meet the threshold for a provisional licence following the review of their documents by the relevant committee.Mathare United and Posta Rangers took advantage of the extended deadline and are now awaiting the review.&ldquo;All Premier League and National Super League clubs, except Oserian FC, had submitted their documents by the initial December 16 deadline but fell short,&rdquo; said Mwendwa. However, he added, Oserian have no chance for another application and will have to be relegated to the Division One League.He observed that there are various categories that the clubs need to pass and more so the mandatory category &lsquo;A&rsquo; which features legal and financial status.&ldquo;All the said clubs were called by the committee after their failure and were made to understand the reasons why and what they need to do to be compliant before the deadline,&rdquo; said Mwendwa.The review of the resubmitted documents will be done on January 3, 2017, with the committee&rsquo;s report tabled before the National Executive Committee a day later. Here, FKF will develop the list of the clubs to feature in the 2017 season and forward it to KPL.Mwendwa said those who will feel that the process was unfair will be required to file their grievances with the FKF Appeals Committee.&ldquo;Teams which will not have met the threshold will be relegated,&rdquo; Mwendwa said.However, he revealed full compliance will be assessed by June next year and clubs which will have negated on their provisional licence will be relegated at the close of the season.Mwendwa added that the licensing will be an annual process, with a license issued in each season. Those who fall short will be axed from their respective leagues.So far, only Tusker and Ulinzi Stars have fully complied with the requirements and are therefore eligible to represent the country in the CAF Champions League and Confederations Cup respectively.
