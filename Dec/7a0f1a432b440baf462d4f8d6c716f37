In any democratic society, where the rule of law is respected, you may expect from time to time, to see a clash between personal interests and national interests.Such is the case now over the ongoing doctor's strike: the striking doctors are demanding the fulfilment of the improved terms of service long agreed on, between their union and the government; it is their right to do so. On the other hand, the government is in a tight corner, as it seems unable to meet its contractual obligations in this matter: it is actually in the government's interests that doctors salaries should not be too high.Tough situations like these, are a test of leadership. There has to be a way out of this impasse.And we will soon know what kind of leadership we have at the Ministry of Health, in the days to come. And whether this leadership is up to the task now before it, of resolving the ongoing crisis in the public health sector. For this tragic crisis must not be allowed to continue for another full week. A solution has to be found, and quickly.
