Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma (pictured) has urged ODM members to stop petty fights and focus on party leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s presidential bid. He said infighting in the Nyanza region is hurting Raila&rsquo;s bid.&ldquo;Leaders in the counties should not give Raila a headache trying to mediate. Let&rsquo;s instead help him woo voters,&rdquo; Ranguma said on Saturday during an ODM forum in Kisumu town.
