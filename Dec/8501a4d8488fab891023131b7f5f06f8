Kenya has made immense progress since Independence, but tribalism and runaway graft have impeded the Founding Fathers&rsquo; dream, Cord leader Raila Odinga said yesterday.Marginalising communities in development has frustrated the goals of the Founders to eliminate poverty, ignorance and disease, he said.&ldquo;We must reflect on where we have failed and ashamed our Founding Fathers and the next generation. With that in mind, accept responsibility and confront the future with a new honesty and commitment,&rdquo; Raila said in a statement to media groups.He added that the 52nd Jamhuri Day, celebrated yesterday, should be a new beginning for those in power and citizens to build a country free of graft, tribalism and exclusion.Raila and Cord co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) skipped the fete held at the Nyayo Stadium, presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta.A change in protocol during the celebrations denied Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, the host, a chance to deliver his speech.Due to the rain, only Uhuru and DP William Ruto addressed Kenyans. Ruto did not read his speech and only welcomed the President, who read his.Kidero is supposed to invite Ruto, who then welcomes the President.Kidero, in a statement, said there should be expeditious dispute resolution methods to end &ldquo;prolonged grandstanding&rdquo; problems that affect the nation, including the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike. He pleaded with doctors to call off the strike.
