They can't take their animals to the seasonal rivers. This has forced a number of them to flee towards Marigat and Mochongoi," said Kimunyan.He said locals might resort to retaliatory attacks if the government fails to take action.On Friday, Marigat-based human rights activist Amos Olempaka termed the attack politically instigated and accused Tiaty MP Asman Kamama (National Assembly Security committee chairman) of remaining mum while "his people kill others".Kamama has in the past debnied allegations that he supports banditry.Read: Governor Tolgos accuses Tiaty MP Kamama of funding rustlers, banditsAlso read: I do not back banditry, says MP KamamaOlempka said armed attackers raid neighbouring communities every December holiday."Now that the government has tried to tighten security by installing police posts along the borders, they want to scare away security officers so that they get a chance to raid the neighboring Tugen and Ilchamus pastoral communities,"he said.He urged Interior CS Joseph Nkaiserry and IG Joseph Boinet to accord the matter the urgency it deserves.
