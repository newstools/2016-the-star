Mwingi residents have urged the government to ensure it solves the water problem. Residents say they pay high bills, but water supply is always cut off. &ldquo;When there is no water we buy a 20-litre jerrican for Sh50 and the water is not even good for human consumption since its gotten from the streams and the Tyaa River,&rdquo; said resident Kilonzi Mukuta.
