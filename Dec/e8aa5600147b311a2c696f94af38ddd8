More than 100 people arrested in Kisumu town on Wednesday have accused police of brutality.They said they were arrested arbitrarily and tortured at their workplaces by officers from Kisumu Central police station. The officers conducted the swoop because Kisumu is hosting the East African Legislative Assembly Sports and Culture games.Some victims had swollen limbs, while others sustained head injuries. Kisumu City Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada condemned the arrest and brutality against innocent residents.He said those arrested were not taken to court, but released on bail of between Sh10,000 to Sh20,000. The arrests simply aim to collect money from residents. It is unacceptable and unconstitutional, he said. Ogada said no law bars people from walking or working at night. He accused police of using non-existing laws to extort hard-earned money from the public. Ogada said the law on bail is being misused.
