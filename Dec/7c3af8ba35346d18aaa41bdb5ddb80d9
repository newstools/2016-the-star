Attorney General Githu Muigai made frantic efforts yesterday to ensure Interior PS Karanja Kibicho is not arrested and handed over to prison authorities to serve a three-month jail sentence imposed on him for contempt of court.In a notice of appeal filed at the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi, he said his office is dissatisfied with the decision by Justice George Odunga and now wants an audience with the Court of Appeal. Githu wants the notice given priority and expeditiously heard. The State Law Office wishes to appeal the decision dated November 29, the notice reads.On Tuesday, Justice Odunga ordered Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to arrest the PS and take him to prison after he failed to appear before him to explain why his ministry has refused to compensate a victim of the Nyayo House torture chambers.The ministry has yet to pay Michael Mahugu Sh2.6 million the court awarded him for torture he was subjected to while in detention. He sued the state in 2013 and the court ruled in his favour. Mahungu now wants the state compelled to pay him. Kibicho failed to respond to his claims.The PS was to appear before the judge on Monday, but his lawyer said he was held up in a meeting. The judge then ordered that he appear on Tuesday, but once again he failed to honour the directive, prompting the ruling. The law is clear that the PS is entrusted with carrying out his constitutional mandate, which, in the court s view, he has failed to fulfill, Odunga said, before ruling that Boinnet personally execute the order. By yesterday, the PS was still at large. It remains unclear whether the IG will comply.
