Suspect Benson Okumu was arrested on Saturday for unsafely circumcising five boys in secret in Bunyala South, injuring them and causing two to bleed profusely. Khajula assistant chief John Kudombi said the boys are aged between two and three years. Okumu used a razor blade, which is against the law, he said.
