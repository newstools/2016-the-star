Two Iranian lawyers and their Kenyan driver facing charges of collecting information for a terrorist act were detained yesterday for another seven days, pending bond ruling. They were arrested after filming the Israeli Embassy in Nairobi.Sayed Ebrahim, Abdolhosein Safaee and Moses Mmboga, who denied the charges on Thursday, will remain in police custody at the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit headquarters until December 13. Milimani senior principal magistrate Joyce Gandani ordered they be detained after the prosecution strongly opposed their bail application.Director of Public Prosecutions, through senior state counsel Duncan Ondimu, urged the court to deny them bond on grounds they are a flight risk because they do not have a fixed abode in Kenya. Investigations have revealed the Iranians had been residing at the Laico Regency Hotel before their arrest.The prosecution also told the court the three were arrested in a car belonging to the Iranian Embassy next to the Israeli Embassy on Bishops Road. They had been visiting two other Iranians jailed for life over terrorism at the Kamiti Prison. The diplomatic status of the two is unclear.&ldquo;Investigations are still going on to establish their intended mission. They are bound to face extremely serious charges so they should not be released on bail pending determination of the case,&rdquo; Ondimu said. He told the court the current visit of the accused persons is not reflected in Immigration systems though their passports bear entry stamps.
