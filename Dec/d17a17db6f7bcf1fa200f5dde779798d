Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said he will not play &ldquo;politics of sycophancy and poverty&rdquo;.Mutua said his style of politics, which he said is focused on development, has put him at loggerheads with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.Despite being kicked out of Wiper, Mutua said he is confident of becoming a major party leader in the country&rsquo;s political scene. &ldquo;Unlike some leaders, I do not want to be the lord of poor and struggling people. I want to be the humble leader of people who are living decent and dignified lives,&rdquo; he said in Machakos town yesterday.Mutua said the Maendeleo Chap Chap party is welcoming candidates from all counties for elective seats ahead of 2017.On development, the governor cited the unveiling of the tarmacked 15km Kathiani-Kakuyuni-Kangundo road, which he said some leaders are not happy about.The road was unveiled on December 22. He said a major communication link was constructed by the county roads ministry at a cost of Sh150 million.Mutua said he will not be intimidated by political detractors. &ldquo;When they hear I am doing politics of development they don&rsquo;t sleep as they plot how to bring me down. They will fail,&rdquo; he said.This is the second road done by the county government after the 33km Makutano-Mwala road.
