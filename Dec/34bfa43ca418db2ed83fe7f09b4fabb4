Time magazine has named US President-elect Donald Trump as its Person of the Year."It's hard to argue that anyone had more influence over the events of this year than Donald Trump," Nancy Gibbs, managing editor of Time, said in announcing Trump's selection. She also noted the fact that the country continues to roil over "a profound argument about whether his influence was for the better or for the worse."The news magazine billed Trump as president of "the divided states of America."The cover story unveiled Wednesday marks the 90th Person of the Year designation by Time.Time also revealed its short list of other candidates considered for the Person of the Year recognition. Trump's Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton was in the running, as were "the hackers," the faceless miscreants who the magazine said "took aim at American democracy itself."Musical megastar Beyonce, who on Tuesday topped this year's Grammy Award nominations with her provocative "Lemonade" album, and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who fended off a coup attempt, were also on the list. So were the biomedical scientists involved in the CRISPR research effort to edit and alter DNA in a multitude of species.
