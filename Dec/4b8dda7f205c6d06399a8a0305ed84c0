A war of words erupted yesterday between nominated MCA Zulfa Hakim and Education executive Anne Lokidor over the state of the county primary schools.The MCA posted on Facebook that her heart is bleeding when she thinks about what children are subjected to as they toil to go to school.&ldquo;The state of some of the county primary schools is demeaning to society. This kind of ignorance must stop. I pledge to address this issue at the assembly. We want answers,&rdquo; Hakim said. She also posted a dilapidated picture of Highridge Primary School. However, Lokidor said, &ldquo;That is not true. Education is not a devolved function.&rdquo;Hakim then said, &ldquo;Madam waziri, do you mean it is not up to you [to address the issues of dilapidated] classrooms as the Education executive?&rdquo;Lokidor answered, &ldquo;How do I justify the expenditure? I do not have money to do it. It is not devolved. Or would you rather see me in the dock?&rdquo;She went on, &ldquo;That is why we reach out to partners. Britam with Olympic Primary, Centum with Mathari Primary, KFW Bank Germany with Marurui Primary, St Michael&rsquo;s and Bhakita.&rdquo;Lokidor added, &ldquo;... In terms of impacting lives we have done our best under the circumstances.&rdquo;Residents joined in the conversation, with Karen Sarafina saying, &ldquo;But what about the ECD project that is in the county? What happened to the plan to have an ECDE centre in every ward?&rdquo;Some residents told off the MCA. Derroh Doch wrote, &ldquo;Kiongozi, nice initiative, but I suggest you start with our own New Pumwani Primary School.&rdquo;Ali Omar said, &ldquo;So what is the story then? Public schools devolved or not? Who is ultimately responsible for the state of our children&rsquo;s schools which should be financed through taxes that we pay without fail?&rdquo;He added, &ldquo;Thirty per cent of our income is taken before we even see it, who should be held accountable for these massive downfalls?&rdquo;Mutawaa Ramadhani said, &ldquo;Unless you are intoxicated or your surroundings are full of toxic [substances] that you cannot see, all primary schools are either public or private entities. Let&rsquo;s be realistic here. Private schools are well managed so that means well equipped. County primary schools are county government-run. So dear, do your homework first instead of talking anyhow.&rdquo;
