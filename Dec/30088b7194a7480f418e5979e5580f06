The government decision to bypass fathers in the DNA tests to identify victims of the December 10 Naivasha accident has elicited mixed reactions from Kenyans.While others lauded the state for the move, some felt that it was not right to misjudge the biological link between the victims and their fathers.DNA sequencing experts posit that mothers are the best sample to use in ascertaining parental links to an offspring as most fathers could be taking care of children not borne of them.Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said the government had decided to get DNA samples from mothers, brothers and sisters to identify the remains which were burnt beyond recognition.He said the move had been necessitated by the fact that many men could be raising non-biological children making fathers' samples less reliable.Read: The reason experts turn to mothers in DNA tests to determine identityVisionary Sage, a twitter user, lauded the government's move saying it would save homes from potential break-ups in the event of disputed paternity results."That is a good move by the government as it would break event the best of families. In the event of disputed DNA, nobody wants to walk with a heavy heart in such circumstances," he said.Robert Evens, another user, said the government should not have blocked men from giving the samples as being a biological dad and being a father are different roles."It would be judgmental for anyone to choose one parent over the other because of their biological connection," Evans said.Read: Why Chiromo is not accepting fathers DNA "Anyone can take a DNA test. What matters is that there was love between the late and the living. Nobody chooses were to be born or who should bring them up," he added."If you find that the DNA results do not match, then focus on the love and social well-being because we know of biological families who cannot put up with each other," Evans said.Emmanuel Sillah said the pretense in the society would have torn many homes should men have been allowed to take the tests "as they are polygamous beings"."The people who were involved in the accident were mostly from one direction so it was for the best that only mothers were allowed to take the test," Sillah said.The accident claimed 43 lives after a lorry carrying flammable chemical rammed 14 other vehicles.
