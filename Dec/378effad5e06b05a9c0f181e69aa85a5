The KRA has intercepted 24 containers of new clothes, shoes and milk powder worth Sh150 million, in one of the largest single seizures at the Port of Mombasa.Port Operations chief manager Joseph Kaguru said the Kenya Revenue Authority would have lost about Sh75 million had the cargo been sneaked out of the port.Kaguru said items in 21 containers had been concealed as cold rooms and flasks, while those in the three others were sachets of Hilwa branded powdered milk and tins disguised as flasks and sewing machines.Read: KRA seizes two containers of illegal milk powder at Mombasa portThe items were detected after the containers were scanned, he said, adding they will purchase three more."A fixed scanner is expected to be installed at the port in the next one month,&rdquo; said the chief manager.More on this: KRA acquires state-of-the-art scanners to fight graft at Mombasa portKaguru said the goods, that were being transported by horticultural firms, will be forfeited by the government&ldquo;The smugglers used names of fictitious flower companies .
