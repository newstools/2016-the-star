The Maasai Mara ecosystem is, no doubt, one of a kind in the world. It is uniquely endowed with features and attributes that make it a true wonder of global proportions. It is the duty of Kenyans and East Africans to preserve it and the water towers associated with it, as an integral part of this region s brand identity, he said.He, however, regretted that the honor came at a time when 10 million Kenyans are reportedly facing starvation due to prolonged drought and inadequate water.He said, "matters of environmental conservation especially in water catchment areas must be taken seriously in order to reverse the threatening trend not only in the country but in the whole of the African continent". I, therefore, accept this honor on behalf of all those people who believe and seek to advance the course of environmental and water conservation in Africa, he added.The former president challenged the Maasai Mara University to take a leading role in ensuring that the Mara ecosystem is properly conserved by generating knowledge that expands the horizons of possibility for humanity."With this university taking the lead, we can set a new rhythm for the conservation of the Maasai Mara s rivers as well as the flora and fauna," he said.Also read: Kibaki gets honourary Phd
