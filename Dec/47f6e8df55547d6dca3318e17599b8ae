Africa 10,000m bronze medallist Joyciline Jepkosgei showed her true class leading from the gun to the tape to win the second edition of the Ziwa Farmers Road Race in Uasin Gishu County over the weekend.The race, which started at Kabenes, had world half marathon runner Pascaliah Jepkorir and Bahrain&rsquo;s Eunice Chebichii in command at the 500 metres mark.Jepkosgei then stepped up, calling the shots with every stride she made. Pascaliah tried to stay in touch behind her but failed to keep up the pace .At the half way point, Jepkosgei controlled the pace ensuring the competition had been whittled down before breasting the tape in 32:18.She left Pascaliah second in 32:19 and Chebichii closed the podium in 32:34.Magdalene Masai settled for fourth in 33:17 followed by Gladys Yator in 33:36.Jepkosgei, who recently set the Marseille-Cassis 20km course record, said she was not sure of a win but got motivated when she realised the other competitors could not respond to her pace.&ldquo;When we started I went in front and decided to pace it since I was using it for speed work. When I realised no one was following me, I decided to finish it. I am very happy I won the race,&rdquo;Jepkosgei, who finished second at the Family Bank half marathon said.In the men&rsquo;s 10km category, 2015 Turin half marathon winner Bernard Kipkemoi had to fight hard to overcome stiff competition from the Family Bank half marathon winner Jorum Lumbasi and Kalya Half Marathon winner Nicodemus Kipkirui.But Kipkemoi skilfully beat them to claim his maiden victory at the race after finishing third last year.Kipkemoi clocked 29:47 for the victory as Lumbasi timed 29:57 in second and Kipkirui settled for third in 30:03.Stephen Kibet finished fourth in 30:14 followed by Albert Kangogo in 30:15.Victorious Kipkemoi, who comes from Keringet in the South Rift region, was in the leading pack of 10 in the opening kilometres.At the 5km mark, the race was reduced to him, Lumbasi and Kipkirui.Realising his rivals were good sprint-finishers, Kipkemoi upped his pace at the 6km mark but Lumbasi hang on.At 9km, Kipkemoi had opened a 200 metre-gap and raced his way to victory.&ldquo;Iam very delighted today that I was able to secure victory after placing third last year.It was hard competing here in Uasin Gishu but I managed to emerge victorious,&rdquo; said Kipkemoi who represented Kenya at the 2013 world cross country in Poland.He is now optimistic of making the team to the IAAF World Cross Country next year in Kampala.
