Kanu has warned President Uhuru Kenyatta against signing the electoral amendments saying the consequence will be its participation in Cord demonstrations from January 4.Party secretary general Nick Salat said the amendments do not represent the views of Kenyans and were geared towards satisfying the selfish, individual interests of those in power.Salat claimed the the ruling Jubilee Party government was planning to rig the polls to impose leaders on the electorate so as to carry on with looting and pushing a tribal agenda.&ldquo;The rigging process has started very early. We cannot sit, wait and watch. We want Kenyans to exercise their right and elect the people who can serve them,&rdquo; he said on Friday.&ldquo;We have seen high levels of corruption and our people isolated in many areas because some of the leaders in this government are serving individual interests. We want good leadership and that is why we have to elect people we want."Read: Cord MPs walk out of special sitting as Jubilee's pass contentious election lawsSalat further said that despite having an agreement with the ruling Jubilee Party, Kanu will not entertain policies that do not represent the people's desires.."The state pushed for the amendments to trigger opportunities for rigging so that they illegally continue to stay in power," he said.The Kanu boss also noted that his party experienced rigging committed by state machineries in Kericho and did not want a repeat since Kenya's leadership was wanting.&ldquo;We have to defend our country and push for the interests of our people. Kanu represents Kenyans, not a few people like Jubilee,&rdquo; said Salat.Read: Cord declares mass demos from January 4 after disputed election laws passedBut Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) said on Thursday that Kanu and Musalia Mudavadi's Amani National Congress will support them in the demonstrations.He said, when Cord officially announced the protests, that they all want peaceful and credible elections.
