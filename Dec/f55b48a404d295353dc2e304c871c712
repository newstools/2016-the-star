Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro has summoned senators for a special sitting on Thursday to debate the contested electoral law amendments. In a gazette notice, he said the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2016 will be the only business of the day.Earlier this week, Ethuro directed the Senate Legal Affairs Committee to invite public input on amendments to the contentious law. He pushed the debate to January 4 to let the committee conduct the public hearings. The senators met last Wednesday to consider controversial changes made to the laws as adopted by the National Assembly on December 21.On Wednesday and Thursday, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights held public hearings on the proposed amendments. The changes, which significantly alter the laws, have been opposed by Cord leaders and other members of the opposition. The opposition claims allowing a backup system is the same as reverting to the manual identification of voters and transmission of results.
