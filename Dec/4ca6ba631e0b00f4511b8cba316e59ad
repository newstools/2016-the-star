The 12th general election is barely eight months away and the atmosphere of transition &ndash; whether Uhuru is reelected or not &ndash; is palpable nationwide. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga's separate speeches on the occasion of the 53rd Jamhuri Day had references to 2017.Raila issued a statement on Jamhuri Day Eve in which he spoke of a wind of democratic change that is sweeping Africa, particularly the former Coup Belt of Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia, where presidential incumbents have been removed in elections. Uhuru made a call for unity in diversity and invoked the Independence generation of his father Jomo Kenyatta and Raila&rsquo;s father Jaramogi Odinga. Among other things he said, &ldquo;The founding generation would remind us that whoever steals from the common purse is not just a thief, but an enemy of our unity&rdquo;.The President did not use the words, but this was an unmistakable reference to the corruption scourge that has overtaken Kenya on Jubilee's watch.
