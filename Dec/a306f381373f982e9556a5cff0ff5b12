Police whipped residents of Gitaru, Kiambu county, on Friday night as they siphoned fuel from an overturned tanker and hauled it to their homes, oblivious of the danger. In the past, there have been incidents of Kenyans burnt to death or seriously injured when the fuel they siphon catches fire. The January 31, 2009, Sachangwan blaze was among the worst in which at least 113 people died and more than 200 were injured. In the Friday incident, the lorry was transporting diesel, petrol and paraffin to a petrol station in Kikuyu town, when the driver lost control of the vehicle and it rolled and landed in a ditch. It caused a huge traffic snarl-up. The truck driver and his loader escaped unhurt, police boss Joseph Ongaya said. “Owing to the danger witnessed in other places, we had to restrain people, by all means, from going to fetch the fuel,” he said. The accident caused a traffic snarl-up.
