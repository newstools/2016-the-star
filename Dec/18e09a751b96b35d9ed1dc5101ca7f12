Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has dismissed claims that he cannot effectively serve residents because of numerous ODM rallies that he must attend.Ranguma said he was quoted out of context but added he is a life member of the party, keen on implementing its manifesto on matters development.Sections of the media reported the Governor as saying the rallies were to blame for the slow development in his county.Ranguma said the comments could easily be interpreted to mean that ODM is anti-development, "which is not the case in Kisumu"."Anyone issuing such remarks is just being petty and is out to malign my name and that of the party," he said in a statement on Thursday."As an ODM Governor, it is the manifesto of the party that I implement in Kisumu."Read: Ranguma steals show at ODM rallies, sends rivals back to drawing boardRanguma further said that the county, being the centre of focus for rating the performance of devolved units, cannot afford to lag behind in development."And while ensuring we grow the county's economy, I also work hard to ensure our leader Raila Odinga captures the Presidency in 2017," he added.He urged party members and his supporters to "ignore such irresponsible reporting".The Governor made the comments a day after the county launched the Sh15 million electronic trade licensing (e-TL) system in partnership with World Bank.Ranguma said the system will help the business fraternity in his county access and submit trade licence and public health certificate application forms online.He said the system is aimed at boosting revenue collection and easing the process of doing business by enhancing accountability, transparency and efficiency.Ranguma further noted that the e-TL, formerly known as the Single Business Permit (e-SBP), will transform ways of doing business in Kisumu.Kisumu was recently ranked by the World Bank as the best in terms of ease of doing business.World Bank representative Frank Twagira on Wednesday said the county was among those where approvals for building plans are obtained quickly."Devoid of bureaucracies, the digital system has reduced the human tendency to delay processes," he said. "This is besides promoting an environment that encourages external investment."Read: Kenya ranks 92nd in ease of doing business
