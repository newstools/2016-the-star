A section of Samburu MCAs have opposed the Thursday reshuffle of two county executive committee members.They said switching Health CEC Mary Ekai to the education department with Peter Lolmodoni was 'unhealthy for the county'.The MCAs said the changes will affect service delivery in the devolved unit and referred the move as a situation of transferring a problem.Governor Moses Lenolkulal made the changes after a five-member adhoc committee of the county assembly recommended that Ekai be impeached.The committee, in its report, said the official be removed for misappropriating funds, flouting procurement laws and harassing workers.Read: Samburu MCAs vote to impeach county health minister over misappropriation Elly Loldepe, Maralal MCA, said: "The reshuffle is simply not right. It is like removing a monkey from one forest to the other. A monkey cannot change," He said that the timing of the reshuffle was wanting, being done at a time the county has less than one year to complete projects lined up for completion in the first term.Loldepe said: "It is difficult to respect a seemingly ill-intentioned move by the county chief executive," Nominated MCA Irene Leshore said that the governor made a mistake in transferring the said CEC to a more sensitive department.She said that this remains unacceptable since the adhoc committee had found out the CEC was not suitable to hold any public office."In our report, we had recommended that the CEC be sacked through an impeachment but instead the governor decided to transfer her, we are not happy," she said.On her part, nominated MCA Modesta Lalaikipiani cautioned Lenolkulal against playing politics using CEC jobs at the county. The MCA said that the governor must ensure that officers assigned roles in the county be professional.Suguta ward MCA Lesoipa Shadrack described Ekai's transfer as "jumping from the frying pan to the fire"."As the health ministry is healing, the education ministry is now getting ill," he said.In a circular, Lenolkula said the reshuffle was to make the administration effective and efficient.Tourism chief officer Lydia Letinina was moved to the health department, switching the post with Josephine Leterewa.
