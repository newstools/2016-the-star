The government is launching a major disarmament in Northeastern to prevent gun violence before, during and after next years polls.Addressing the press in his office on Wednesday, regional coordinator Mohammud Saleh said there is a huge number of illegal firearms in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties. As we approach the elections, the firearms can be misused. Any person found with an illegal firearm is considered a Shabaab militant. They will suffer the consequences, he said.But in a reconciliatory tone, Saleh urged those possessing the guns to surrender them to the nearest chiefs, their assistants, the county commissioners, the police or any other security agencies.The administrator said the government will not hesitate to use force if they fail to comply. Saleh said most conflicts in Northeastern revolve around clans and residents can take advantage of election campaigns to cause violence, especially those not satisfied with negotiated democracy adopted in Mandera and some parts of the region.Interclan skirmishes, often brought about by political boundaries and competition for pasture and water. These have claimed hundreds of lives in the three counties.Saleh warned politicians against inciting residents against each other, saying their unity is key to the development of the region. He urged them to conduct peaceful campaigns. We appeal to politicians to ask for votes in a manner that will not incite any group against another, Saleh said.Speaking separately on the same day, Garissa Peace Committee chairman Hassan osman urged the police to crack the whip on politicians using artists to compose songs in their praise.He said most songs are laced with hate speech that could easily trigger clashes between communities.
