NPSC chairman Johnstone Kavuludi has been accused by his brothers of using state machinery to harass them in a dispute over a piece of land.They said Kavuludi is conspiring with their father, 94-year-old Jamin Kavuludi, to deny them of their birth right.Julius Kavuludi and Charles Siali want IPOA to intervene and contain Kavuludi, whom they say has turned hostile against them and "is no longer the brother they used to know"."Our brother is so power-drunk. That's why we, his family, are treated so brutally," Julius, a doctor at Vihiga Referral Hospital, said on Thursday.Siali, a former journalist, said there has been a long-standing family feud over a piece of land their father subdivided in 1997.The parcel is situated opposite Senende Secondary School in Hamisi subcounty, Vihiga county."Most of us moved out of the home and bought other pieces of land elsewhere. As of now, we cannot go back home just comfortably as we fear we may be harassed by police at the gate," Siali said."Even some of our step-brothers have never stepped into our homestead to see the old man. It is that bad," he added.Persistent arrestsLast Thursday at 6pm, it is alleged that AP officers guarding the homestead locked up one of the brothers, Zekedia Muhavi, who had decided to go back."Police roughed him up, put him on a motorbike at around 11pm and escorted him to Shamakhokho. Unfortunately they got an accident along the way and was seriously injured," Siali said.Muhavi was treated by Julius and the next day at 3am, he decided to go back to their parents' home, insisting he had important issues to discuss with their father.But Muhavi was reportedly arrested and detained at the Serem police station in the morning, released and re-arrested in the afternoon.He was then charged with causing disturbance in their home."The police almost shot him when they learnt he had come back. They manhandled him and took him to Serem police station," Siali said."Muhavu has stayed in Ndalu (Kitale) for the past 20 years. But he suffered a drawback after he failed to repay a bank loan and his property was auctioned."He now finds himself in a state of bankruptcy and has returned home to seek solace from his family," he added.Siali said Muhavi had built a house on the parcel but police denied him access.He said instead of calling a family meeting, Kavuludi resorted to using the police to intimidate and manhandle their brother."Instead of welcoming him back, our brother does not even want to hear anything about him. Muhavi came back in July, when we learnt he was in Kiminini Cottage Hospital, Kitale, after being poisoned," he said.Siali said their brother would have died were it not for Julius who rescued him when he was in a coma."Despite being told, Kavuludi did not even go to the hospital to see his ailing brother," Siali said.Muhavi was discharged and went to live in Shamakhokho, a few kilometres away from their family home."We don&rsquo;t know whether [Kavuludi] wants to see his brother rot in jail or just dead," Siali said.'Orders from above'The former journalist said it is clear that police are acting on "orders from above"."What worries us is that Johnstone did not want to say anything about what was happening, yet he was at the centre of it all. Why didn&rsquo;t he come out clearly on the issue?&rdquo; Siali said.Police at Serem confirmed that they arrested Muhavi because he caused unnecessary disturbance.When journalists sought to talk to the father to the Kavuludis, they were locked out, threatened and chased at the gate to his home by Administration Police officers who had made a series of calls to their seniors.The officers almost damaged reporters&rsquo; cameras when they tried to take pictures of the Kavuludi&rsquo;s home.Police at Serem said Jamin had gone to the station with important documents and was willing to settle scores with his son amicably.But journalists were denied this information.Attempts to reach Kavuludi on phone through text messages failed, as he did not reply to our inquests.But another brother, who resides at Shamakhokho, promised to take journalists around their home.
