The government has warned politicians against inciting violence during campaigns for next year's general elections.Spokeman Eric Kiraithe said the government has noted a rise in "primitive and criminal" behaviour among politicians in public events."It is shameful that grown up politicians have been splashed in the media committing assault and taking part in pubic fights," he said on Wednesday."We urge the police to move with speed and arrest any person involved, regardless of their political affiliation," he added.He said confrontations between legislators and aspirants might lead to hatred among people, adding that every individual is free to choose which side to support politically."Political opposition and differences in opinion are entitled to every individual ... it is not a crime. Every person is free to vie for any political position in the country," Kiraithe said.But he noted that it must be done with respect, maturity and within the law.Kiraithe also asked members of the public and political parties to condemn any conduct that would lead to violence.His remarks come a few days after two politicians reportedly fought at an ODM rally in Homa Bay.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma fell and injured his arm when he was pelted with stones by ODM supporters at Homa Bay Stadium on Sunday.The violence broke out when Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma and his rival Washington Ogaga started fighting.Witnesses said Kaluma had been dancing next to Ogaga.
