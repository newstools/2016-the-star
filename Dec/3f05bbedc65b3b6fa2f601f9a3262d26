The Kiambu government on Thursday signed an MoU with the Kenya Revenue Authority to help the county collect property taxes and single business permits fees. The partnership will enable the county government to leverage on KRA&rsquo;s iTax platform to collect revenue through any of their 37 banks, as well as through mobile money transfer. The implementation of the MoU is expected to make it difficult for defaulters to operate undetected.Governor william Kabogo said the county government has no capacity to collect all the rates.&ldquo;The partnership with KRA will give Kiambu residents confidence that money collected will not go into individuals pockets," he said.County revenue officers will have user rights on iTax to enable them generate billing slips through the system. Taxpayers will also be able to make payments and generate e-slips through iTax. Governor William Kabogo gave residents 30 days of 100 per cent waiver for any pending rates of accrued interests.He said those who will fail to comply will pay interests and penalties to get certificates of clearance from KRA. Kabogo said there are many commercial buildings in the county, which are not listed with KRA.&ldquo;The public should come to the county government and ask to waive penalties and interests accrued, as it will be difficult if we give the mandate to KRA to collect the rates as they will be collecting everything from principles, interests and penalties,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;Upon full implementation, taxpayers will be availed the convenience of accessing their bills and make payment from the comfort of their premises via iTax and generate and print their permits," KRA Domestic Taxes commissioner Benson Korongo said. In the last financial year, the county collected Sh2.5 billion, which was Sh800 million shy of its Sh3.3 billion target.
