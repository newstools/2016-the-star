Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday told a Senate committee he has no direct evidence to implicate former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka to land grabbing in Mavoko. I am not in a position to point out exactly which land was grabbed. The EACC and NLC should provide that information, Mutua told the Public Accounts and Investments Committee chaired by West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo.On Wednesday, Mutua tabled a 93- page document which he claimed would show how Kalonzo exploited his position when he was the Vice President to irregularly influence the allocation of two pieces of land to himself and through proxies.He produced documents regarding land registered as LR 22278 and IR 130409 in Mavoko municipality, Machakos county, registered under Desiral Ltd.He said the company is believed to be registered under his name (Kalonzo) and that of his spouse Pauline Kalonzo. The other land is registered LR 201185 and IR 673338 - 4,000 acres within Mavoko municipality.Mutua went on to allege Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama delivered Sh350 million to Kalonzo to join Cord. Muthama is campaigning for Mutua s job.Mutua said Kalonzo used the money to buy a helicopter - the Eurocopter B3 registration 5Y DKK - for Sh200 million. Senators poked holes in Mutua s list which he tabled on Monday of alleged land grabbers in Mavoko subcounty even as Cord allied senators said the documents should be expunged from Senate records.Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and his Nyamira counterpart Kennedy Mong are dismissed the governor s documents as mere photocopies by a lawyer asking for investigations. The governor should produce tangible evidence linking Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka and other prominent leaders to land grabbing. I have read the document and what was presented to the committee was just meant to divert attention from the financial malpractices flagged by the Auditor General, Khalwale said. What is contained in the 93-page document are pure allegations.
