Unlike the 2015 season where the Kenya Volleyball Federation was basking in glory at a time like this, thanks to the outstanding performances from women&rsquo;s national teams (Team &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;), little can be written home about this season.Team &lsquo;A&rsquo; won the World Grand Prix Group 3 event held in Australia and earned a promotion to Group 2 while Team &lsquo;B&rsquo; under the stewardship of Paul Gitau won the gold during the All Africa Games in Congo, Brazzaville.And fast forward to this season, the national senior women&rsquo;s team recorded dismal performance during the World Grand Prix Group 2 and the Olympic Qualifiers in Cameroon&mdash;a development which led to the reshuffling of the team. Critics and pundits in equally measure, said KVF shot themselves in the foot when they dropped veterans and experienced duo of Brackcidise Agala and Janet Wanja as the team prepared for Olympic qualifier in Cameroon.The team failed to impress as they succumbed to the fast improving Cameroon before they were awarded another chance to compete in the World Olympic qualifier in Puerto Rico. Although KVF recalled the duo, it was a case of too little, too late as they once more fell by the way side and missed out on the Rio Olympics.The team would then proceed to Group 2 of the World Grand Prix, where they again failed to sparkle at the end of the series in Poland. This saw them being relegated to Group 3 but were later reinstated in Group 2 by FIVB for the sake of developing the competition.On the flip side, however, the women&rsquo;s under-23 national women&rsquo;s team under the stewardship of Catherine Mabwi qualified for the next year&rsquo;s World Championship set for Ljubljana and Maribo in Slovenia having finished second behind Egypt in the qualifier staged in Nairobi last October. Once again, the national men&rsquo;s team remained dormant this season with little to offer. However at club level, Kenya Prisons and General Service Unit participated in the Africa Club Championship in Cairo, Egypt early this year but were equally not impressive.At the local Scene, Kenya Pipeline women&rsquo;s volleyball team defended their domestic trophy having overpowered their nemesis Kenya Prisons, Kenya Commercial Bank and Nairobi Water in the play off staged in Mombasa in November.In the men&rsquo;s category, General Service Unit surrendered the title to their arch rivals Kenya Prisons, as Nairobi Water defied odds to qualify for the play-offs alongside Kenya Ports Authority. Regulars Kenya Defence Force failed to make the cut. End of the season also saw promising players stump their authority as the fast improving Kenya Pipeline and national team middle blocker Triza Atuka and Kenya Prisons&rsquo; left attacker Jairus Bett were feted the Most Valuable Players in 2016.Reached for comment in regard to the 2016 season, KVF chairman Waithaka Kioni said the results of the women&rsquo;s team were not fulfilling this time round but was quick to note that 2017 will bring better tidings. &ldquo;Locally, the play-offs were very competitive and successful. We look forward to a better season next year,&rdquo; said Kioni.
