Yamaha Kenya has handed over 15 motorcycles bought by the Kenya Police Service in a partnership aimed at enhancing road safety during the festive season. The high-speed motorcycles will go to 15 of 20 police officers trained under the Yamaha Riding Academy. The officers are expected to train their colleagues and boda boda operators in the country. &ldquo;Through this exercise, we at Yamaha Kenya hope to help increase the number of certified trainers across the country and ensure that all riding schools have the capacity to train boda boda operators and enhance the safe use of motorcycles,&rdquo; division general manager Augustine Juma said.
