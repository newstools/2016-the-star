Footballers in Rwanda have been banned from using witchcraft during games after a striker scored a goal within seconds of allegedly performing a ritual mid-game.In a match in the Rwandan Premier League between Mukura Victory and Rayon Sports, Mukura striker Moussa Camara looked to perform a ritual on the goal post.Camara was seen putting some paraphernalia on the goal post, and then scoring a goal within seconds.The striker, whose team was losing 1-0 at the time, was then chased away by Rayon Sports goalkeeper and a number of yellow-clad opponents.Vice president of Rwanda FA Vedasite Kayiranga said: "In Federation of Rwanda Football Association statutes we don&rsquo;t have any law punishing the use of witchcraft."Kayiranga told the Sun that there was nowhere in the world where was proven that it can influence the outcome of a game."However, with the violence between players because of allegations that one team is using it, we have decided to enact laws," he added.Hamza Nkuutu, a columnist for Rwandan newspaper the New Times, said Camara removed an item that the Mukura goalkeeper had allegedly planted as part of a witchcraft ritual to protect the goal."This happened twice, which meant the referee had to stop the match twice," Nkuutu said.Despite various bans at the international level, the practice of witchcraft remains prevalent in Africa, including in Rwanda where the antics of the Mukura-Rayon match went viral.Players found guilty of practicing witchcraft will face a three-match ban and a roughly $120 (Sh12,296) fine. Coaches who use the witchcraft will face a four-match ban and a $240 (Sh24,607) fine. According to the New Times, if a first-division team is found guilty of using witchcraft, it&rsquo;ll lose three points in the league&rsquo;s standings and pay more than $600(Sh61,484) in fines.
