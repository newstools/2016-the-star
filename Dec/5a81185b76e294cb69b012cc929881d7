Education executives from Coast and North Eastern counties should be sacked over the dismal performance in the KCPE exams, an NGO boss has said.Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said the bottom eight counties are from the Coast and North Eastern, with the exception of Mombasa, which only managed position 29.Isiolo, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Wajir, Lamu, Tana River, Garissa, and Mandera trailed in the counties performance list in that order, with the highest in the list scoring 227 and the lowest 183 marks.Khalid said that even last year Coast and North Eastern counties were at the bottom of the list."There should also be an urgent review of the education systems in the counties to ensure better performance next year. Governors and the national Ministry of Education must put immediate measures to improve results," he said."Education is now a devolved function. This means county governments now have the responsibility of ensuring the right of education is guaranteed. That perpetually, children from Coast and North Eastern perform dismally is a show that this right to education is not fully being delivered by those vested with the responsibility of doing so." In the exams, Mombasa was position 29 among the 47 counties, with a mean score of 245 marks, while Kilifi had 226, Kwale 218, Taita Taveta 217, Lamu 211, and Tana River 207.Before the exams began early last month, Mombasa Education executive Lewa Mtana and political leaders insinuated that students' non-performance will be blamed on regional coordinator Nelson Marwa because he banned the distribution of food to candidates.Lewa said the students, mostly from poor families, were to benefit from the food during exams period so they can concentrate on the exams.The standoff led to foods worth thousands of shillings going to waste.But some candidates secretly feasted on the food after exams, as the county defied Marwa's order.Lewa was unavailable for comment over calls for resignation of education executives. His phone was off and he did not respond to a text message to his mobile phone.
