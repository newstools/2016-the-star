Services at the Kenyatta National Hospital are expected to be disrupted further after consultants withdrew their services yesterday, leaving the burden to KDF doctors and nurses.More than 300 consultants under the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Doctors Union said they have been working at the hospital since the doctors' strike started, but the government seems reluctant to address their grievances.KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga said the consultants are working under critical circumstances since doctors withdrew their services.&ldquo;The current situation at the facility has made it hard for us to deliver our services. We are forced to operate like a level four hospital due to lack of the personnel we work hand-in-hand with,&rdquo; he said.The consultants said the strike would bring to a halt services in the private and public wing of the hospital.&ldquo;Unless they implement the collective bargaining agreement signed in 2013 and withdraw all cases facing our union leaders and the union, we will continue with the strike,&rdquo; Oluga said. The consultants have urged the government to withdraw KDF doctors from the hospital.The specialists have said KDF have limited personnel.&ldquo;KDF lacks important specialists such as pathologists, paediatric surgeons, cardiologists and many others, making it difficult for us to work with them. They also have failed in their mandate,&rdquo; a specialist said. Dr Edwin Walong, a pathologist at KNH, told the Star they face a big challenge. "We are forced to work and hold even extra roles previously held by other specialists. It is tiresome," he said. Walong said they face financial problems, and cannot even afford a medical cover. Currently, a doctor is expected to pay between Sh60,000 and Sh70,000 medical cover per year.
