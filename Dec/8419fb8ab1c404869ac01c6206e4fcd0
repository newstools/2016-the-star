The Central Bank of Kenya intends to appeal a High Court decision stopping it from taking any steps that would result in liquidation of Imperial Bank. The Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation has also filed its notice of appeal against Justice George Odunga s decision. Delivering the judgement last month, Odunga said CBK and KDCI should not drive the bank into liquidation unless and until all options of reviving it have been considered. He said the two are under obligation to consider any reasonable proposals made by the shareholders to revive the bank. If the same are not found viable, Odunga said CBK should inform the shareholders of the reasons for making such findings, but it is not entitled to ignore any proposals without consideration. Odunga said it is for the shareholders to make reasonable and tangible proposals and they should not simply float unviable proposals.
