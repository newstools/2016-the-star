Suspended National Irrigation Board boss Daniel Baraza has defended the procurement process for the development of 13 multibillion-shilling irrigation projects in Turkana county.The former NIB general manager yesterday told the Public Investments Committee the process was above board.Baraza ,who was the last witness to appear before the committee hearing a petition by Turkana residents, said the projects have turned around the lives of residents.Turkana residents petitioned the National Assembly to investigate the board s operations saying most projects launched have been abandoned, posing serious threats to them and their animals.But Bazara said a feasibility study was conducted and the board visited the projects more than three times.The former NIB boss told the Adan Keynan-led committee 10 of the 13 projects launched in Turkana have been completed and have improved lives. He said two projects are ongoing, while one was abandoned.
