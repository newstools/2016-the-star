'Parliament of Owls' poetry collection is the first book by Adipo Sidang' and explores different themes, the over-arching theme being politics and the state of leadership in our country.The title Parliament of Owls comes from the collective noun for a group of owls - actually known as a parliament of owls. Placed within context (of African cultures) an owl is a symbol of bad omen. The similarity between owls and politicians is pretty much interesting. The title candidly points to the collective displeasure the society has in our politicians and leaders. Parliament of Owls thus expresses the over-arching theme of politics in the collection, specifically found in part one of the book. Titled 'Kingdom of the Deranged', the poetry in part one touches on the politics of a society where truth is folly and vice versa. Part two of the book is titled 'Book of Love, Laughter and Lies' which basically explores the personal theme of love and affection. Part three is 'Poems in D Minor' which relates to the existential issues that we face as human beings especially of life and death, anxiety and despair. In music, minor keys represent dark emotions. Finally the last part of the book is titled 'Weapenry of the Poet' and asserts the place of the poet in the society.The book is available at the University of Nairobi bookstores, Amazon.com and direct orders can be made on "Parliament of Owls" Facebook page.
