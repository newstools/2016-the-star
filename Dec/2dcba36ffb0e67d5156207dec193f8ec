He shocked the country when he made a surprising move and announced his intention to vie for President next year. Well, presidential hopeful and Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong&rsquo;are is taking no chances as he pursues his dream, dismissed by some as a pipe dream. The Ford Kenya senator says he has assembled a well-oiled presidential campaign machine that would rival other contenders'. &ldquo;I am a man of means with enough resources to feed my family and with yet more to mount not-so-cheap a presidential campaign,&rdquo; says Mong&rsquo;are. The lawyer-journalist-turned-politician says his campaigns will also be funded by Kenyans of goodwill who "have pushed me to actualize the Third Liberation of this country."*********Double standards you may call them, but that is the most vivid description of our political outfits in contemporary Kenya. ODM, arguably the country&rsquo;s single largest political organisation, is accused of turning a blind eye on some &lsquo;rebels&rsquo; rocking the party from within, allegedly because of their large shareholder 'dividends&rsquo; in the party. While ODM initiated a process of disciplining errant MPs and county chiefs a few months ago, those in the know argue several others who have openly expressed divergent political views were spared the rod, despite their continuing to drift away. South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya went against party wishes and campaigned for the KNC candidate in the Nyancheki ward by-election, who came third with impressive results. While he did this openly, not a single finger was pointed at him, allegedly because he is among a few political-cum-business tycoons who fund the party&rsquo;s operations. Kisii Senator Chris Obure, who is currently campaigning for the President Uhuru Kenyatta's reelection at ODM's expense, continues to ride in calm waters, raising questions of high-level double standards in the Orange party.**********Is it true that most wealthy politicians who walk around with bundles of cash and easily dish out thousands to people who matter little in their lives ignore key people who ensure they are safe? Well, it has emerged that a number of politicians from Western Kenya are stingy to the extent that they fail to feed their bodyguards and drivers who wait in parking lots as they wine and dine in five-star hotels. A first-term MP from Western Kenya is said to leave his bodyguards hungry and thirsty as he moves around in top hotels. At times the bodyguards are said to stay in the parking area all day as the man hosts lunch meetings and dishes thousands of shillings to waiters, parking attendants, receptionists, girlfriends and complete strangers.**********People interested in nomination slots are seriously lobbying for the posts that include MCA, Senator and MP. Our moles confirm some of the people in the so-called big political parties are demanding kickbacks, which include bribes, sexual favours and a salary sharing schemes, among others. A vocal politician in the Jubilee Party is said to have promised a chain of ladies nomination slots. The ladies cannot avoid bragging about it.
