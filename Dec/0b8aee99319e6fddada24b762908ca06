Senate Health Committee chairman Wilfred Machage and County Assemblies Forum secretary general Albert Kochei yesterday blamed the health workers&rsquo; strike on the national government.Machage accused the national government of refusing to acknowledge that health is a devolved function, saying the government is holding back a huge chunk of the health budget and has failed to develop policies to guide the sector.He, however, urged nurses and doctors to call off their nationwide strike, which started on Monday and has paralysed services in all public health institutions.&ldquo;The national government has been unwilling to support the devolution of health functions. This is to blame for the challenges facing the sector, which have unfortunately been blamed on governors,&rdquo; Machage said. Kochei criticised the President for being silent.
