Residents of Rabai constituency in Kilifi county have called for closure of all companies operating illegally.They say many companies are operating secretly.Two weeks ago, a fire broke out at an illegal gas refilling company.&ldquo;It was by sheer luck and grace of God that our houses were not burnt down,&rdquo; Mariam Washenga, whose house is a few metres from the company, told the Star yesterday.The accident happened at around midnight, when many people were asleep.Gas cylinders from the company were thrown more than a kilometre away, some falling on Washenga&rsquo;s roof and others in the farm.Washenga said she was woken up by a heavy explosion.&ldquo;At first, we thought we had been attacked when we saw the burning gas cylinders flying in the sky. We called the police who arrived at around 4am with the fire engines,&rdquo; she said.The company's management was not available for comment.Jubilee Nominated Senator Emma Mbura has called for thorough inspection of the companies.
