President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday committed himself to peaceful campaigns for next year s election.He urged his opponents to do the same as a way of ensuring Kenya does not take the path of violence before, during and after the elections. I m making a firm commitment for myself and on behalf of [Jubilee] party members to conduct a peaceful campaign. I urge all leaders to consider [signing] this pledge, the President said. Elections and the electoral process are an integral part of democracy and give power to our people to choose their leaders. We should not let this important process be marred by irresponsible and destructive language. Uhuru said a credible process establishes a legitimate government in which legislators are accountable to voters, adding this is a key ingredient of democracy.He spoke after addressing the second National Leadership Summit in Diani, Kwale county, after signing the peace pledge a Mkenya Daima initiative.The conference was co-organised by Parliament and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance.Opposition leader Raila Odinga led his colleagues in snubbing the conference, saying they viewed Kepsa as an appendage of the Jubilee administration .The President urged the public not to allow electoral violence to define Kenya s politics, saying campaigns must not be personality based, but issues-based. We can disagree on issues, but this should not be the basis for personal hatred. It behooves us, leaders, to join in a common cause and pledge to support this objective, he said. In the run-up to the 2013 election, many leaders pledged their commitment to peaceful elections and incorporated peace messages in their campaigns.
