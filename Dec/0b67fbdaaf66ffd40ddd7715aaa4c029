Iteso Cultural Union leaders and politicians have criticised women and youths who heckled Busia Water executive Gregory Odeke. Odeke is perceived to be &ldquo;an enemy&rdquo; of area MP Arthur Odera.The leaders had attended the annual Iteso Cultural Union Day at Kakapel Primary School where Busia Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa and Cultural leaders from Kenya and Uganda were in attendance.Trouble started when Odera accused the county government of allegedly failing to provide water to Angurai residents.&ldquo;The county government should use funds from the emergency fund to provide water to residents,&rdquo; he said.When Odeke rose to respond, some women interrupted his speech. He accused Odera of having masterminded the unfortunate scenario. Odeke said the water shortage in Angurai is caused by dry spells. &ldquo;As a short-term measure, we will avail water bowsers to areas with water scarcity,&rdquo; he said.Soroti Iteso Cultural Union chairman Nicholas Odokoria urged the leaders to stop politicking during such events, which are meant to unite the people.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear of imaginary boundaries between Teso North and Teso South. The unity of the community is important before you try to seek of unity with other neighbours,&rdquo; Odokoriasaid.Wangalwa asked leaders across the county to uphold peace. &ldquo;I have sacrificed my ambitions to support Governor Sospeter Ojaamong for reelection, because I value unity,&rdquo; he said.At the same function, former Amagoro MP Albert AA Ekirapa dispelled rumours that he intends to run against Amos Wako for Busia Senator.Ekirapa, who was MP between 1997 to 2002, said to win the Senate seat will require him to get support from seven subcounties because two from Teso region will not secure him enough votes to gain victory.
