The CDF cash was meant for long-term projects with a huge impact, not short-term ones with little benefit, Board chairman Elias Mbau has said.He said some MPs issue as little as Sh3,000 for bursaries, which is not enough to cover a student s school fees. Some MPs issue money, which does not adequately assist in projects, in order to fund more projects and appease the community, Mbau said.Mbau spoke in Kangema town where he inspected CDF projects. Members of the public should be used to point out priority projects that are beneficial to their community, he said. Mbau was accompanied by other board members.He said funds have been disbursed to 267 constituencies whose proposals were evaluated and approved for this financial year. Mbau said 23 constituencies have not submitted their proposals for evaluation. This may undermine project implementation as campaigns get underway, he warned. He said the board routinely monitors and evaluates projects funded by the kitty to ensure money is well spent and the projects are implemented to the required standards. We have seen some constituencies allocate a lot of money to ghost projects, Mbau said.
