Deputy President William Ruto's legal advisor Anania Mwaboza has said he will not allow descendants of the Sultan of Zanzibar to evict people from the land they are occupying and on which they have built houses.The descendants returned from Oman and threatened to evict residents. They have demanded, through their lawyers, that they pay Sh8 million and above per space occupied by their houses, but Mwaboza says they are too poor to afford it.
