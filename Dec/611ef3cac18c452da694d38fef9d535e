He said the Constitution mandates the counties to organise cultural activities.&ldquo;The Kenyan constitution recognises culture as the foundation of the Nation and as the cumulative civilisation of the Kenyan people. This is the reason we have held Kitui communities' cultural festivals each year since 2013,&rdquo; he said.Malombe said people who shun or abandon their culture and traditional ways end up becoming slaves of utopian and exotic ways they do not comprehend. &ldquo;No efforts should thus be spared in upholding and preserving our long-held Kamba cultural ways and traditions,&rdquo; he said.Kilonzi underscored the objectives of the cultural festival as the promotion of domestic tourism, cultural values of the Kitui people as well as building cohesion and social integration among the communities.She said the cultural event creates an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate scientific, technological, historical and cultural achievements. Kilonzi said it is a platform for linking past, present and future generations.She said the festival provides an opportunity to showcase the cultural endowment of Kitui county.Kilonzi said her department has plans to conserve cultural heritage through identifying, documenting, rehabilitating and gazetting pre-historic sites.She said plans are also underway to mobilise and organise communities to brand cultural artefacts and products. Communities will be trained on value addition of their indigenous products and how to create wealth, she said.Kilonzi said measures are also being put in place to promote preservation, use and marketing of natural products like honey and herbs.
