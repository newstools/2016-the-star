Water CS Eugene Wamalwa is considering shifting his political base back to Trans Nzoia county and running for governor there.He had said he would run for Nairobi governor, but the announcement was met with resistance from a section of Jubilee politicians. Eugene yesterday said he will announce his plans in February.His possible return to Trans Nzoia politics is already causing jitters among some politicians in the region, with Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa saying the CS has &ldquo;rendered himself irrelevant in local politics due to lack of principles&rdquo;.&ldquo;It will not be possible for him to joke around with voters and change his stand every other time thinking people will just follow him,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We want to tell Eugene to stop imagining that it will be easy for him to clinch the governor&rsquo;s seat by shifting back to Trans Nzoia.&rdquo;Eugene is likely to run on the Jubilee ticket, which has already attracted several aspirants, including businessman Kakai Bisau, who was previously in New Ford Kenya with the CS before they moved to Jubilee mid-this year.&ldquo;I am already on the ground planning for the Jubilee nominations and I am prepared for healthy competition with anyone,&rdquo; Bisau said on the phone yesterday. He has been considered a favourite to clinch the Jubilee ticket next year, but the return of CS Wamalwa could complicate matters.
