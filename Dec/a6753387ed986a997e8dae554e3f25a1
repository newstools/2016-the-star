A top performing pupil in Kilifi is asking for financial support as he cannot afford secondary school fees. Khamis Katana scored 402 marks. The ninth child in the family of 10 said, Getting those marks is not easy in this area, where we go hungry almost daily...During the exams we received food from the county government.
