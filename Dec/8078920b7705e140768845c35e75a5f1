The state has suffered a second setback in the extradition case of two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and two foreigners to the US.A chief magistrate&rsquo;s court in Mombasa has ruled that the state has to produce live witnesses, which the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is reluctant to do. Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told the court on two occasions they will not need live witnesses. He said he closed his case and will not call live witnesses.Baktash Akasha, Ibrahim Akasha, Gulam Hussein and Vijaygiri Goswami are wanted in the US for drug trafficking. Chief magistrate Julius Nang&rsquo;ea said the proceedings will not continue without the eight witnesses mentioned in the affidavits produced by United Statesprosecutors. On December 1, Muteti told the court they will use an affidavit sworn by officers from the US. Defence lawyers Cliff Ombeta and Kirathe Wandugi had made an application for the state to produce all the witnesses who had sworn the affidavit.Among those who will be cross-examined are American chief investigator Michael Lockhard, a prosecutor in the New York court Mathew Kellow and six confidential sources.In November 2014, warrants of arrest were issued by a US court for the four over a drug trafficking case. They are required to answer a narcotics importation conspiracy charge. The four were arrested by anti-narcotics police officers at the Akashashome in Nyali.Copies of the arrest warrants in the Southern District of New York were attached to an application by Muteti. Ombeta said since the DPP has already closed their case, it will be their chance to cross-examine the witnesses.
