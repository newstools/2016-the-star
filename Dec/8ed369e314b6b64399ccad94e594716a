County governments will recruit retired health workers on a temporary basis to alleviate the suffering of patients as the negotiation between the health workers and the national government go on.Nurses and doctors have been on strike since Monday.County Public Service Boards National Consultative Forum chairman Philip Kungu said they will recruit those who have skills to attend to patients.These include retired clinical officers and nurses and who work in the private sector.&ldquo;We have asked the departmental heads in our facilities to ensure the labour that is available can be made accessible to those who in dire need,&rdquo; Kungu said.He addressed the press on Thursday in Mombasa town on the sidelines of the fourth annual convention of the CPSBs.Kungu told the national government to provide adequate security to those who will be hired to prevent attacks from the striking nurses and doctors.&ldquo;They cannot work in fear and intimidation, particularly when it involves saving lives,&rdquo; he said. At least 10 patients have died since the strike started. Kungu ruled out returning the Health function to the national government as a solution to many health workers&rsquo; strikes.Instead, he said Kenyans must strive to ensure devolution works. He said problems in the Health docket have dragged on for far too long.
