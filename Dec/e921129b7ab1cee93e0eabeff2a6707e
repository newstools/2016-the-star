The Rift Valley regional coordinator has dismissed reports that 14 people were shot dead in banditry attacks in Lumelo, on the border of Baringo and Turkana counties.Wanyama Mudiambo could only confirm that a woman was killed and a 12-year old girl injured in a shootout on their way to a medical camp in Lomelo last Sunday."We are sorry to the families... But we are now on to media houses that propagate lies," he said.It was reported that more than 20 people have been murdered since November 25 in ongoing attacks among armed pastoral communities along Kerio Valley and Kapedo.According to local leaders, the number might increase especially in Lomelo, Pulpusion and Kamuge villages.Read: Over 20 killed in ongoing Kerio valley, Kapedo attacksMudiambo said those who made the claim should record statements as the government cannot permit the spread of fear among peaceful residents."We have not rested since it was reported that a large number of people were massacred in Lomelo and Kamuge. We found out that it was a blatant lie," he said.He accused the media of instilling fear and putting security officers' jobs at risk and noted that police bosses, county commissioners and chiefs at the locations were better-placed to give details."Politicians behind the leaking of wrong information to the public should also record statements," he added.Mudiambo underlined that the government was committed to ensuring peace in the North Rift.He urged the region's leaders to unite to end attacks in Kerio Valley and Kapedo, among members of the Turkana, Pokot and Marakwet communities.The regional coordinator addressed a peace meeting in Kalowa, Tiaty subcounty on Wednesday.He was with Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi, Elgeyo/Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo.Kaparo asked leaders from the warring communities to unite and fight lasting solutions to the clashes.
