Is the Mombasa Republican Council planning to stop the next general election at the Coast region?Its spokesperson Richard Lewa has said they plan to move to court to stop the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's activities in the region before the next general election.Lewa said as MRC members, they still maintain Pwani si Kenya and IEBC services are not needed in the region.&ldquo;If the government wants to know why we say this, they should call us and speak to us or wait in January when we take our case to court," he said.It is only less than nine months before the next election in 2017.He said the IEBC should not conduct any activity at the Coast until the case is heard and determined.Lewa was responding to questions that have arisen after the disappearance of MRC chairman Omar Mwamnuadzi.&ldquo;We have plans to go to the High Court and obtain orders stopping IEBC activities before voting begins,&rdquo; Lewa said.He said they are looking for funds to file the suit.Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said he will not comment on the matter at that moment.IEBC official Aisha Mohamed said she will not comment until she hears that from MRC itself.&ldquo;I need to comment on this from an informed position since I don&rsquo;t know what prompted them [MRC] to reach to such a decision,&rdquo; she said.Mwamnuadzi has been missing for the past four months after he jumped bail at the High Court in Mombasa.In late November, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko told a Mombasa court Mwamnuadzi might have been killed. Sonko was Mwamnuadzi's surety when he was given a Sh10 million bond.Lewa said MRC is not a political party and all the members are aware of it, but if anyone feels they want to vote, it is an individual decision.&ldquo;We are not supporting any candidate in 2017,&rdquo; he said.He said Mwamnuadzi remains MRC chairman for the Coast region &ldquo;If any of the member dies or leaves, that will not be the end of MRC Activities will go on as usual,&rdquo; Lewa said.In July, a Mombasa court sentenced to death two MRC members for murdering Changamwe OCPD, OCS and two officers in 2013.The two were Jabri Dzuya and Bwana Mkuu Alwan.&ldquo;Registration of new members is on. We therefore, urge anyone willing to join us to come out and be registered,&rdquo; Lewa said.The registration started barely a month after the High Court lifted orders banning the movement.MRC has demanded talks with the government on alleged historical injustices.Court of Appeal judges Daniel Musinga, Patrick Kiage, Jamilla Mohamed, Kathurima M&rsquo;noti and William Ouko ruled the High Court was right in lifting the notice banning the movement.They said every Kenyan has a right to demand secession if deemed the right course of action.Lewa said during former members will have to renew their membership, according to the MRC constitution, and laws, while any new member will be required to pay Sh1,000 registration fee.He said they plan to open branch offices in the six counties before the registration starts.Lewa said Mwamnuadzi is the &ldquo;President&rdquo; and there are 32 &ldquo;cabinet officials&rdquo; from whom one will be elected as Mwanuadzi&rsquo;s assistant.Some people say Mwamnuadzi is on a recruitment mission.
