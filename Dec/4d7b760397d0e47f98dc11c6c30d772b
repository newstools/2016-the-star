The military and the police may soon be compelled to produce the bodies of people who have been killed or disappeared while in their custody.Parliamentary caucus on human rights chairperson Agostino Neto on Tuesday said the team will consolidate all cases and move to court.Neto was addressing the press at a Garissa hotel after a human rights meeting.The caucus also held sessions with family members of some victims. One thing that has come out clear ly is that military camps have become synonymous with abductions. People are blindfolded and tortured before they are killed, he said. We have people who do not know where their loved ones are, thanks to police and military brutality. These relatives want to see their people either dead or alive. But speaking separately in his office, Northeastern regional coordinator Mohamud Saleh said if the caucus has evidence of its claims, it should produce it. As government we have nothing to hide. They should be fair enough to seek the views of the people who have been mentioned, he said.Neto said in Garissa alone, 12 people have been abducted or killed. He said most crimes happened almost at the same time after the April 2, 2015, Garissa University College attack. Neto said the caucus will demand specific police officers be charged with criminal culpability.
