The HIV Tribunal has managed to handle 600 of the 800 cases it received since it started operations three years ago.Tribunal chairman Jotham Arwa said the agency has been facing numerous problems since it was a pilot project and had no framework to guide its operation.He spoke during the launch of the first Compendium of cases of HIV-Aids.The tribunal was formed in 2006, to handle legal issues relating to HIV-Aids, including discrimination against people living with the virus and protecting the confidentiality of their medical records.However, it started operations in 2009, but did not acquire members to head it until in 2012, when they started addressing the cases.Arwa said since then the tribunal has faced structural, operational and financial problems in fulfilling its mandate.The tribunal chairman said the major problem they faced was the fact that the tribunal could only carry out operations from Nairobi. We are having a major challenge because people who come from places like Kakamega and Northeastern have to come all the way to Nairobi for hearings. We really need to go to all the 47 counties if we are to make more progress, Arwa said.He said lack of offices in different parts of the country had also contribute to the limited awareness of the tribunal. Many HIV victims do not know where to turn to when they have been discriminated against, Arwa said.He said they also lack a clear framework outlining their operations. The tribunal still does not have its own Rules of Procedures. It relies for its work on the provision of the HIV Act and adapts general rules applicable before normal courts, the chairman said.The tribunal also lacks appropriate physical infrastructure.As of December 2014, it was located within the premises of the National Aids Control Council of Kenya.This discouraged the smooth and confidential administration of justice on a highly stigmatised condition such as HIV.The tribunal also faces financial constraints have led to a slow progress of its success.During its first two years of activities, it was mainly supported by donors, including the UN.Arwa urged the government to increase funding to enable it succeed in eradicating HIV-Aids by 2030.
