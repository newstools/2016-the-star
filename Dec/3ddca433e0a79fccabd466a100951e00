Shared payment systems firm Kenswitch has launched a marine cargo insurance portal to enable processing of cover for all importers and exporters.Managing director George Wainaina yesterday said the portal will harmonise the platform and achieve efficiency for local exporters and importers. "Insurers have been mandated to come up with an automated process to ensure that business of importers and exporters is not disrupted. The desired automation is an online solution that ensures it is seamlessly done locally as opposed to what has been happening," Wainaina said.
