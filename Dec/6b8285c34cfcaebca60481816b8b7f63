Private hospitals in Kakamega county are receiving a high number of patients as the doctors's and nurses strike continues.Kakamega County Referral Hospital remained closed yesterday, even as the Kenya National Union of Nurses urged its members to resume to duty.Patients from Butere, Matungu, Mumias East, Lurambi and parts of Siaya county flocked to St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital.Administrator Michael Mugo said the number of new admissions has hit 100 per cent.&ldquo;The maternity wing is congested because the number of women seeking services has gone up threefold. This has overwhelmed our bed capacity,&rdquo; he said.Mugo said the 220 beds in the hospital are filled up and the management seeks to acquire more beds.&ldquo;I have communicated to Kakamega county director of health David Oluoch to send us more drugs and other supplies so we can manage the swelling number of patients,&rdquo; he said. He said the hospital has called in doctors from neighbouring private hospitals. &ldquo;We are serving more than 300 patients in the outpatient department since the strike began. The number in our wards has also gone up to almost 100 per cent. Our four resident doctors could not manage it. We had to seek assistance from sister hospitals,&rdquo; Mugo said.He said they have three doctors from Kapenguria, one from Kiambu and one from Busia. "Those who had gone for studies have also been recalled,&rdquo; Mugo said.Doctors and nurses who were on leave have also been recalled.Mugo said the maternity wing does not have enough incubators to handle newborns.&ldquo;We have four incubators but the number of newborns who should remain there has gone up. We have a problem handling such cases,&rdquo; he said.He said the facility is likely to experience a crisis due to the increasing number of patients.
