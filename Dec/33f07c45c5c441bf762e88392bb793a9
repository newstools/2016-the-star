Two children are the latest fatalities in the doctors&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; strike in Garissa county.Yesterday a mother wanted to throw herself into a crocodile-infested river after her one-and-a-half year old daughter died. She was restrained.The child, Perpetual Kathure, developed a high fever and was rushed to Garissa Referral Hospital. She was not attended to, then rushed to a private hospital, where she was confirmed dead on arrival.Her mother could not accept the loss.This came a day after county Health CEC Hubi Hussein told the press the facility would deal with emergencies in surgery and the maternity ward.Hussein said, however, all 129 nurses and 18 medical officers at the hospital are on strike.In another tragedy, a newborn died yesterday from breathing complications at the Sister Maternity Home, a private clinic overloaded by patients turned away from public hospitals.She had been rushed there from Garissa County Referral Hospital.The baby&rsquo;s father, Samwel Irungu, said his wife developed labour pains on Wednesday evening and they rushed her to the Garissa Hospital, but there was no medic to attend to her.She delivered safely after prolonged labour, assisted by other women. However, the baby had a breathing problem.&ldquo;I decided to act fast and rushed her to SIMAHO, about three kilometres away. On arrival, the baby developed what nurses at the facility described as secretion,&rdquo; he said.Government blamedThe medics tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the infant. The visibly distraught Irungu blamed the death of his first daughter on the nationwide doctors&rsquo; strike.&ldquo;I really wonder why the government has to wait until doctors go on strike to call for negotiations. We elected a government that we expected to deliver. But unfortunately, it seems to have forgotten why it was elected,&rdquo; Irungu said.The mother, Fridah Kawira, was too traumatised to speak to the media.The nurse in charge of SIMAHO, Rumana Noor, said they are overwhelmed by an influx of patients from the public hospital.She said they only deal with minor ailments and deliveries but cannot accommodate the current number seeking their services.
