The Technical University of Mombasa has partnered with Mvita constituency to build a Sh40 million hostel on its Tudor campus to address accommodation shortage.The deal was sealed on Tuesday after consultations between the Mvita CDF team, led by MP Abdulswamad Nassir, and TUM management, led by acting vice chancellor Laila Abubakar. Speaking after signing of the MoU, Nassir said it will minimise accommodation problems. He said the proceeds from the hostel will be used as a revolving fund for needy students on campus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pumping Sh10 million in the first phase of this project that will start latest in mid January,&rdquo; he said. While TUM will provide land and oversee construction, Mvita CDF will fund the project from the beginning to completion under the supervision of a Project Management Committee that includes student leaders. Abubakar said the initiative is the only solution towards resolving the chronic and thorny accommodation problem currently facing all institutions of higher learning in Kenya. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only five hostels, which are inadequate,&rdquo; she said.
