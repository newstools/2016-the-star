Coast hoteliers might sue low-cost airline Jambojet for &ldquo;messing up&rdquo; the region&rsquo;s tourism industry.The Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers on Friday said they will move to court if those grounded by Thursday delays and re-routing of Jambojet flights are willing to come out.On Thursday, hundreds of passengers were left stranded at the Moi International Airport after the carrier ended their journeys in Mombasa, despite booking direct flights from Nairobi to Ukunda and Malindi. Some of the passengers were ferried by buses to their destinations.&ldquo;We might go to court to compel Jambojet to pay for the damages it has caused to the industry at the Coast,&rdquo; KAHC executive officer Sam Ikwaye said on the phone.The Kenya Coast Tourism Association chairman Mohammed Hersi on Thursday wrote to the airline accusing it of &ldquo;dumping passengers in Mombasa&rdquo;.However, Hersi cautioned against the move to sue the carrier, saying it will not solve the problem, saying the issues can be ironed out through a roundtable meeting involving all players.&ldquo;I have engaged Jambojet on many occasions and I think the problems they face are not insurmountable. They can be dealt with,&rdquo; Hersi said.Ikwaye said the losses caused by cancellations over &lsquo;inaccessibility&rsquo; run into millions of shillings, a blow to the region which is enjoying high returns from holiday makers.Jambojet, in a statement on Thursday, attributed the delays and re-routing to &ldquo;unexpected technical challenges on their Q400 fleet that operates most of their Coastal routes&rdquo;.&ldquo;Additionally, the delivery of our newly leased aircraft initially scheduled for introduction during the peak season was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances and will only be delivered early 2017,&rdquo; Jambojet said.The airline said the combined factors forced it to reschedule flights and carry passengers on smaller aircrafts.On Friday, Coast tourism players turned the heat on the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, accusing it of being lenient towards Jambojet and its parent company Kenya Airways.They said the aviation industry regulator has allowed sloppy service from the firms without sanctions.Ikwaye said KQ has &ldquo;powerful people in government&rdquo; as its shareholders, hence enjoys monopoly.
