Garissa woman representative aspirant Fatuma Kinsi yesterday said she will battle it out for the seat after clan members disowned her bid by endorsing another person.On Friday during a meeting held in Nairobi, the Samawathal and the Abduwak clans &ndash; under clan alliance of Tolomoge &ndash; picked little-known Anab Subow for the Garissa woman representative post. She will face off with incumbent Shukran Gure.Speaking to the press yesterday, Kinsi, a former activist and founder of the Pastoral Girls&rsquo; Initiative, said the conclusion of the alliance was unfair. She said the decisionmakers did not take into consideration her potential.She said they also did not adhere to the fact that she was the one who declared her interest for the seat first before the community and she should be given a chance to lead. &ldquo;I assure all my supporters that nothing within the context of the ruling of negotiated democracy excludes me from participating in the August 8, 2017 election. I therefore assure my supporters that we are determined to go all the way in this race for Garissa county woman rep and look forward to victory,&rdquo; Kinsi said.The Nairobi function was attended by political leaders from the county, including National Assembly Majority Leader and Garissa Township MP Aden Duale, Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji, MPs Ahmed Abass (Ijara) and Barre Shill of Fafi. The alliance also affirmed that Ali Korane of the Abduwak clan will challenge Governor Nathif Jama.Senator Haji from the Samawathal will defend his seat in what has in the recent past been termed as &lsquo;negotiated democracy&rsquo;. The Samawathal will also get the deputy governor&rsquo;s slot.Both Jama and woman representative Gure come from the Aulihan subclan. They will defend their seats.
