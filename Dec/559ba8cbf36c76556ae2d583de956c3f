Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has faulted Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i for ordering the reopening of all schools and other higher institutions in the country be on the same date.Rutto termed the decision ill-informed and impractical because it would burden parents who have many children in various learning institutions in terms of paying fees.&ldquo;This is totally an ill-advised idea. We cannot have schools reopening on the same day ... Parents need time to look for fees for their children, who may be in various institutions of learning. By giving this directive, it is overburdening them. Matiang&rsquo;i should not come up with ideas that only seem to go his way and not consider the parents,&rdquo; Rutto said. He spoke at Kamureito in Sotik on Wednesday.The governor at the same time claimed some &ldquo;powerful forces in the national government&rdquo; were behind the refusal by some Bomet MCAs to approve the county budget.He said some individuals, whom he did not name, were pushing the MCAs to reject the budget so as to delay development projects.Rutto said the strong defiance by the ward representatives to pass the budget for several months was a clear sign that some individuals opposed to his administration are influencing them. He said it was saddening that the few MCAs who have taken a hardline position on the budget were those allied to the Jubilee Party.The county boss said despite his tireless efforts to try and break the impasse, few members, who have constantly been fighting him, were working closely with the speaker to ensure the budget does not pass. He said, &ldquo;Some individuals who have always been fighting me politically, and are keen on ensuring that we do not realise our development targets, have now resorted to influencing the MCAs not to pass this budget. They want us to appear as a failed county in delivery of services to the people.&rdquo;
