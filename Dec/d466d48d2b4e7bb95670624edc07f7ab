The Democratic Party has protested against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission&rsquo;s order that aspirants open campaign financing accounts.National organising secretary Njagih Kumantha has said the order is illegal as the amended Election Campaign Act has yet to be ratified by the Senate and assented to by the President.Kumantha, himself an Embu governor hopeful, said the IEBC should suspend the decision, pending ratification.He said the party recently met IEBC officials and tabled its opposition to the implementation of the Act before its approval, adding they expected the poll agency to accede to their demand as it echoed the concern of every aspirant. Kumantha wants the order applied after the nominations, when parties know their candidates. He said the IEBC &ldquo;is jumping the gun for no good reason&rdquo;.The official said at this point, the IEBC should direct only political parties to open accounts because they will sponsor their candidates at the next general election.Kumantha was reacting to media reports that the IEBC directed political parties and candidates for next year&rsquo;s election to open campaign financing accounts by last week, before it extended the date to Friday.The Commission said the Act requires this be done at least eight months to the election date.committees neededIn addition to the accounts, political parties and candidates are to establish campaign financing and expenditure committees and appoint authorised persons to manage the funds.&ldquo;All political parties and candidates are required to register with the Commission the details of their campaign financing accounts, including particulars of the authorised persons,&rdquo; the guidelines state.The IEBC said a political party campaign financing and expenditure committee should consist of nine members.Three of them are to be nominated by the governing body of the political party, while one must be its secretary general.
