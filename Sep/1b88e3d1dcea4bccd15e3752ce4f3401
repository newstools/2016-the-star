The Nyamira assembly is satisfied with the county government&rsquo;s implementation of projects and programmes, speaker Joash Nyamoko has said. &ldquo;I can give the executive 70 per cent. Despite some challenges, they are on course,&rdquo; he told the Star on Tuesday.Nyamoko spoke after a three-day meeting at a Kisumu hotel. &ldquo;This meeting was very necessary because we have hit the homestretch and we did not want to be distracted by the upcoming campaigns,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We were appraised of the implementation of projects and we are pleased with the progress. We don&rsquo;t want a situation where projects are abandoned after five years.&rdquo;Nyamoko said perceived corruption, inexperience and political intrigues slowed implementation of some projects.
