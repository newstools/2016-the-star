Youths in Mt Elgon constituency have been told to keep away from politicians who may seek to recruit them as militias.Area MP John Serut said some politicians have the tendency of recruiting the youth and arming them with weapons during electioneering periods to intimidate certain communities.He spoke at Terem Secondary School when he handed over a bus donated by the National Constituency Development Fund. He also presented a Sh1 million cheque from the National Social Security Fund. Serut said residents do not want a repeat of the 2007 clashes. &ldquo;We know some leaders from this area have a habit of recruiting youths into militia gangs so they can intimidate some communities to vote for them. I&rsquo;m urging our youths to distance themselves from such politicians,&rdquo; Serut said.He urged residents to support leaders who preach peace. &ldquo;Mt Elgon is an area with three major tribes residing here and we need a leader who can unite these communities,&rdquo; Serut said.He said the area has not fully healed from what it went through during the 1992 and the 2007 tribal clashes. Serut urged security agencies to be alert against leaders who preach tribal politics. Serut said he is still weighing his options whether to contest on the Jubilee Party ticket or not. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still consulting with my people. What they tell me is what I will do. I can&rsquo;t go against them,&rdquo; he said. Serut said residents will support President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto for reelection next year.
