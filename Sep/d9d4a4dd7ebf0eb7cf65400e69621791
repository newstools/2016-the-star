Governor Kenneth Lusaka has &ldquo;ridiculed&rdquo; Bungoma residents locally and abroad through his misplaced priorities and should not be reelected, an MP has said. Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has accused the governor of not living up to the expectations of Bungoma residents, who voted for him overwhelmingly as there first governor in 2013. Wamunyinyi said Lusaka&rsquo;s administration has been &ldquo;painted as the most corrupt county government that has siphoned off taxpayers&rsquo; money by buying and procuring things at exaggerated prices&rdquo;. He spoke on Friday at Butieli Primary School in his constituency when he presented CDF cheques to various schools.&ldquo;As Bungoma residents, we elected Lusaka owing to his track record as the Livestock PS, only for us to realise it was a very bad mistake,&rdquo; he said.The MP said Lusaka continues to sit back and watch as his officers embezzle public funds. &ldquo;We have had almost close to Sh30 billion brought into this county since he took over as the governor. There is no tangible project we can be proud of in his regime as the Bungoma people,&rdquo; he said. Wamunyinyi cited the Sh109,000 wheelbarrow saga and the purchase of a Sh2.7 million seat. Officials from Lusaka&rsquo;s office denied the allegations.
