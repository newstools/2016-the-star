Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has extended the term of an eight-person special team investigating the spate of school arsons by six more weeks.The team was formed on July 20 by Matiang&rsquo;i and his Interior counterpart Joseph Nkaissery. This came after fires at more than 115 schools, with students being the main suspects. The extension of the term of the investigations team comes after it met with the CS at Jogoo House. Its mandate is to ensure all cases of school fires are comprehensively investigated. It was to submit its report in 30 days. It is led by career administrator Clare Omollo.The team will determine measures for forestalling future unrest and identify those responsible for the problem. It is also to audit school safety and security regulations and recommend stricter measures for high discipline standards.&ldquo;The team is expected to... spell out individuals who will be held responsible, including through prosecution and surcharging of suspects,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said in a statement in July. &ldquo;The team said it needed more time to thoroughly analyse the data it had collected since it was appointed in July,&rdquo; Matiang&rsquo;i said.The decision means a stakeholders&rsquo; meeting that was to take place tomorrow to discuss the committee&rsquo;s report has been put off indefinitely.
