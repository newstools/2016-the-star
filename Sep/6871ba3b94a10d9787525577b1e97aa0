Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo yesterday said President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s &lsquo;meat&rsquo; remarks indicate his Jubilee administration has failed and it is time for Cord to take over.Uhuru told opposition leader Raila Odinga on September 14 that Jubilee is feasting on meat, while they are still finding their footing and salivating. Raila said Jubilee has two hands &mdash; one that makes Kenyans suffer and another geared towards development.Five days after the spat with Raila, Uhuru and several Nairobi Jubilee politicians ate nyama choma at a local market during an impromptu tour. Gumbo said, &ldquo;When the President hints that Jubilee is eating and other Kenyans should salivate, it means he is out of touch with the citizens.&rdquo;The MP said Uhuru&rsquo;s remarks painted a picture of a government that is not ready to take care of the poor Kenyans, who are the majority. He said Cord will form a government that will cater for the &ldquo;poor salivating Kenyans&rdquo;.
