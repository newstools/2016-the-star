Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar&rsquo;s political adviser Mohamed Ruwange has accused the governor&rsquo;s office of not consulting the people. He said the county government should not be run like a household.&ldquo;The people of Mombasa have the right to know how their money is being used. They should be allowed to ask questions,&rdquo; Ruwange said.He said it was unrealistic for the county to allocate Sh32 million for a pitch, which is not useful to all the people. &ldquo;The county should have priorities and deal with them accordingly. A Sh32 million pitch is not a priority to people whose children are abusing drugs,&rdquo; Ruwange said.
