It is not enough to just initiate grand projects, you must consult their beneficiaries, Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has been told.&ldquo;When a Sh1.3 billion tarmac road passes in front of a woman with a chronic disease, a young man who cannot secure a job after he left college, a mother singing a lullaby to a hungry child and an old man trying to educate his child through high school, that&rsquo;s when you realise that a tarmac road is the least important thing they want to consider as development,&rdquo; Filsan Abdullahi said.She referred to Abdullahi&rsquo;s flagship project &ndash; a 28km tarmac road in Wajir town. Filsan is a postgraduate student at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm, Sweden. She spoke in Wajir town on Monday. She said she was impressed when Abdullahi visited Stockholm last year and said Wajir was rising and was ripe for investment.&ldquo;He told us that he was setting up infrastructure to ease movement and invited us to visit Wajir county,&rdquo; Filsan said. A year later, and 17 years after she left her homeland, Filsan travelled back to Wajir to witness the fruits of devolution.&ldquo;I was pleasantly surprised at the speedy development of infrastructure ... The town that only knew a District Commissioner, representing the Office of the President, was now a government headquarters itself,&rdquo; she said. However, this development must be felt at the grassroots, Filsan said. But resident Habib Harbib said it is a government&rsquo;s role to fast-track infrastructure development to create a conducive environment for investment.
