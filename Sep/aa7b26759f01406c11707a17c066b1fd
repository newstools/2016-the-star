Residents of Bilaa B village in Tongaren constituency are flocking to a home to see a three-month-old baby who is speaking. Joy Wangila is Patrick Wasike&rsquo;s and Salome&rsquo;s firstborn. Salome said the baby has shocked her. &lsquo;&rsquo;When she wants to eat something, she asks for it. If you deny her, she cries,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. Wangila&rsquo;s grandmother Manea Namaemba said, &lsquo;&rsquo;My grandchild shocked me on August 2. It was on a Tuesday when she spoke for the first time. Her mother wanted to breastfeed her but she demanded porridge,&rdquo; she said.&lsquo;&rsquo;One day a neighbour came to see me in the field, where I was digging out potatoes for lunch. When she requested for some, the baby said &lsquo;do not eat anything in this homestead.&rsquo;&rdquo;
