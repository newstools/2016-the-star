By now we can all unanimously agree that the song Bank Otuch is currently an anthem in Kenya.This is all thanks to rappers Octopizzo and Vicmass Luodollar's exploits behind the microphone, which has seen the song take the local entertainment industry by a storm.But how exactly did Octopizzo and Luodollar manage to achieve such huge success?In an interview this morning Octopizzo (real name Henry Ohanga) narrated how he met, mentored and helped propel the fast rising Luodollar (Victor Ochieng Ondeye) to the fame he's enjoying now."Vicmass has been sending me his work since 2009, so I remember meeting him in Kisumu streets back in the day while he was hawking biscuits and bottled water armed with his business cards," narrated Octopizzo who is famed for his club bangers Something For You, Ivo Ivo, This Could Be Us, On Top and Swag ft Amina."He introduced himself as an upcoming artiste who needed support in recording his music."I encouraged him to work harder and push himself to the limits till he saves enough to hit the studio."There's no way I could have funded his recording because I wanted him to enjoy the fruit of his labour," added Octopizzo.&nbsp;He showered Vicmass with praise for his passionate journey to making it big on the scene."Luodollar never gave up, he kept on sending me his songs some which I approved, some I disapproved and a song after another he matured greatly."The trend continued until when the 26-year-old finally recorded Bank Otuch, a song which he never knew would change his life for the better.Octopizo says, "When he released Bank Otuch he never even called me, so one day I bumped into the song on YouTube and I was greatly impressed and equally amazed why the song was not getting airplay."So, I reached out to his producer requesting for the beats without his knowledge."Did a remix and a bit of sharpening here and there as I waited for the original song to pick up."&nbsp;He also opened up on why you will never see him on a political arena, and most importantly, why he will probably never record a gospel song.Listen to the clip below as he narrated how he invited Vicmass for an impromptu video shoot.
