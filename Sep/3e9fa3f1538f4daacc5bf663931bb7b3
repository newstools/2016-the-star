The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority will give its recommendation on Kenya Airways in a month&rsquo;s time, in wake of rising technical hitches that have caused safety concerns.KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe yesterday said the authority is &ldquo;studying the case&rdquo; raised by the Kenya Airline Pilots Association on the airline&rsquo;s incapacitated technical department, which has been dealt a blow by a mass exodus of engineers.At least 50 engineers have resigned from the airline code-named KQ this year, with more set to leave. Kalpa had in a letter dated August 31, written to Kibe, requesting him to look into the matter, which could affect the airline's safety record. &ldquo;We are studying the claims and we shall refer back to them. We have officers on the assignment. We should have answers within a month,&rdquo; Kibe told the Star.He said the authority has received complains not only from Kalpa but other institutions and individuals, concerning safety issues regarding different air services.&ldquo;We are generally concerned about the entire industry and KQ is one of them,&rdquo; he said.Last week, transport Principal secretary Irungu Nyakera revealed that three committees: human resource, risk and assurance committees have been set up to conduct a survey on KQ, which will inform the necessary changes.KQ has suffered several flight delays and air turn backs recently blamed on technical hitches. Among the incidences is last Wednesday where a Juba-bound flight was delayed for hours due to a technical hitch.On August 23, KQ 761 from Johannesburg to Nairobi was forced to make a U-turn after developing problems mid-air as it entered Zimbabwe&rsquo;s airspace."Resignations have become the order of the day and moreso within the technical department. This is a very critical department, and this high attrition has led to a galore of flight cancellations, aircraft technical issues and even air turn turnbacks," KALPA letter dated August 31, signed by its secretary general Captain Paul Gichinga.
