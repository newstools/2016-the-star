Migori Governor Okoth Obado and aspirant Anne Anyanga have criticised each other in the scramble for Nyatike constituency votes.On Thursday, Anyanga was crowned by elders from her Onger home in Macalder-Kanyarwanda ward, with Obado following suit at the same venue on Friday.The coronations are seen as endorsement for the two aspirants from Nyatike, which has the highest number of registered voters in the eight subcounties.Anyanga&rsquo;s coronation as an elder was organised by Luo Council of Elders treasurer Abel Owuor, who said in the Luo tradition coronation can only be done once. He said Obado&rsquo;s coronation a day later was a sham.&ldquo;We have prayed for Anyanga as Nyatike elders to go for the governor&rsquo;s race and anyone who came later is begging for curses,&rdquo; Awuor said.Anyanga said she has the blessings of the elders and the church. Obado&rsquo;s coronation was presided over by Nyatike Luo Council of Elders vice chairperson Margaret Akong&rsquo;o, who said their move was informed by the fact that Obado is the incumbent. She, however, said the coronation was not an endorsement. &ldquo;Our work is to unify the people. This has got nothing to do with him seeking reelection,&rdquo; Akong&rsquo;o said.After the coronation, Obado said, &ldquo;Thank you for the honour you have bestowed on me today, and just like it is expected of any elder, I will foster peace and development.&rdquo;The move highlights clan vote patterns in Nyatike, with Kakoth being the biggest, followed by Kolal, where Anyanga is from. Others are Muhuru, Karungu, Kaler and Jodak.
