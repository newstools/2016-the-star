Ugenya MP David Ochieng has said the three Cord co-principals are taking too much time to decide which of them will be the presidential candidate.He said Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula engage in unnecessary boardroom discussions. &ldquo;Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula are spending too much time,&rdquo; Ochieng said. He spoke on Tuesday during a morning talk show on Citizen TV. Ochieng praised Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for deciding to launch vigorous campaigns to warn the co-principals that time is running out on them.&ldquo;Joho is right to inform them,&rdquo; he said. Ochieng dismissed claims Joho is strategising to deputise Raila if ODM decides to go it alone in the next elections. &ldquo;Joho is galvanising support at the Coast, before moving to hinterland for his future political ambitions,&rdquo; he said.
