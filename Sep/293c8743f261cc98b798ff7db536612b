Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has accused Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu of disrespecting him by visiting his constituency without informing him.He said Waititu has formed a habit of visiting his constituency to seek votes in the Kiambu governor&rsquo;s race.Kuria said Waititu went too far on Sunday when he visited Wamwangi AIPCA church, only a stone&rsquo;s throw from Kuria&rsquo;s rural home, without informing him. Waititu was with Joyce Ngugi, who wants to run for Gatundu South MP against Kuria.&ldquo;I visit other constituencies and I always inform area MPs, but Waititu has formed a habit of visiting my constituency, attending funerals and other functions without my knowledge and in the company of my rivals &ndash; a clear fact he is fighting me. He should declare whether he is fighting me or Kabogo,&rdquo; Kuria said in Gatundu town on Sunday.The legislator said he has tolerated Waititu, but the Kabete MP continues to provoke him.The two MPs separately attended a function in the church on Sunday, with Kuria being the first to come. But as he was taking refreshments in the church vestry, Waititu entered and was received by Ngugi&rsquo;s supporters.The two MPs did not meet as Kuria left for a function in Gatundu town organised by the Gatundu Matatu Owners and Drivers Sacco.&ldquo;Even Governor [William] Kabogo has the courtesy to inform me when he is visiting Gatundu. I don&rsquo;t know who Waititu thinks he is and he should stop behaving as if he has already been elected governor,&rdquo; Kuria said.The MP urged the matatu sacco members to increase their savings.He said he has organised a harambee in November to be presided over by Deputy President William Ruto. Proceeds will be shared according to how much a sacco has saved.The MP said he ask Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to address the problem of harassment of matatu and boda boda operators.
