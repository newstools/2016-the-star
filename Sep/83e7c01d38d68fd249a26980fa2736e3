The Kiambu government will soon start issuing bursaries after the assembly passed the Bursary Act amendment to comply with the Public Finance Management Act.&ldquo;The amendment is now awaiting gazettement,&rdquo; Education chief officer Ann Gichohi said. Last year, Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo had ordered the county to stop issuing bursary until it complies with the law.It has not issued the funds since the directive. More than 15,000 beneficiaries suffered and some dropped out of school due to huge arrears. So far, the county has distributed more than Sh210 million to more than 40,000 needy students.Education is a major pillar in Governor William Kabogo&rsquo;s manifesto and the county government has invested in the bursary fund.&ldquo;Through the fund, we have witnessed a rise in high school enrolment with a projected increase in the coming year once individual allocation has been increased,&rdquo; Kabogo said.
