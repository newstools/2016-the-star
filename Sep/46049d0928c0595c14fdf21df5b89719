More than 1,000 nurses and health workers in Uasin Gishu have threatened to go on strike next week over delayed promotions and poor working conditions.Kenya National Union of Nurses national chairman John Bii on Friday said, &ldquo;We will wait and if the county doesn&rsquo;t engage us by September 27, we will tell our members to boycott their duties to demand their rights.&rdquo;He urged Governor Jackson Mandago to intervene. &ldquo;We have met the county on numerous occasions, but nothing happens after we meet. We think the county is taking us for a ride,&rdquo; Bii said. He said nurses hired on contract should be maintained on permanent terms.Health executive Margaret Chepkwony said the county will meet the union this week. Bii said many counties have promoted medics. &ldquo;The working environment is not conducive for effective service delivery. Counties still face an acute shortage of health workers to meet requirements of the World Health Organization for effective service delivery,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Devolution of health services has not been beneficial to Kenyans as expected because of mismanagement by the county governments.&rdquo;
