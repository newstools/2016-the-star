Teachers in Kakamega county have welcomed re-introduction of school ranking in national examinations results but want the schools categorised.Matungu subcounty Principal Of the Year Daniel Indimuli said schools should be classified according to facilities and equipment.&ldquo;You cannot compare Alliance High School with a rural school such as Khalaba whose laboratories are not well equipped and lack essential facilities,&rdquo; Indimuli said.&ldquo;The ministry of Education should work on proper ways of ranking and improve the conditions in rural schools,&rdquo; Indimuli said.He said ranking will instil a culture of competition in teachers and students.Then all schools will strive to get better grades and mean scores.Indimuli said grading prevents laziness amongst the stakeholders and drives teachers to put more effort into their work.Khalaba Secondary School had a mean grade of six points in the 2015 KCSE exam and has a target of 7.14 this year.&ldquo;We have prepared the candidates well and completed the syllabus early. We have embarked on thorough revision and confidence building in the candidates,&rdquo; Indimuli said.Khalaba principal Matungu urged the government to invest in co-curriculum activities to create more opportunities for students careerwise.&ldquo;When the success of students only hinges on the grades they get, it puts pressure on the learners who can be successful in areas other than classwork,&rdquo; he said.He supported the introduction of technical courses, saying this will open more opportunities.&ldquo;Some of the learners are excellent in out-of-class activities but very poor in classwork. We should not dismiss them as failures because they poor academically,&rdquo; he said.
