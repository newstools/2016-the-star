Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago is embroiled in another row with Senator Isaac Melly.Melly has said more than Sh2 billion development funds cannot be accounted for. He angered Mandago&rsquo;s team when he said he has information the money meant for projects has been misused.However, Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno accused the senator of peddling lies for political gain.&ldquo;He is never in the county and does not understand what goes on. He should be ignored,&rdquo; Chemno said.The senator accused Mandago of taking credit for projects funded by the World Bank, European Union and the national government.&ldquo;Many of the projects listed for development by the county have not been implemented yet the money allocated is missing,&rdquo; Melly said.He made the claims as Mandago, his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos and local MPs on Tuesday recorded statements with the DCI over storming Moi University.They oppose Laban Ayiro taking over as acting vice chancellor because he is not a member of their community.Melly said, &ldquo;This is not politics. As senator my responsibility is mainly oversight to ensure money is spent on the public, not individuals.&rdquo;The World Bank has just completed a slum upgrading project in Eldoret town for Sh1 billion.The project included tarmacking of roads, installation of streetlights and improvement of drainage in Huruma, Munyaka, Kamukunji and Langas estates. The bank also funded construction of pedestrian walkways for Sh700 million.Melly says the governor has been taking credit for the projects. New classrooms have been built and modern public toilets set up in slums. The senator also cited the streetlight programme called &ldquo;Mwangaza Mtaani&rdquo;.
