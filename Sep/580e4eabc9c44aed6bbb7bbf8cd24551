Joseph Asenwa is thanking his lucky stars after his participation in the LOTTO gameshow enabled him to win the Sh1 million grand prize which was up for grabs in what was LOTTO&rsquo;s 84th draw.Asenwa, the fourth of eleven children, had been earning a living as a shamba boy (farmhand) after the death of his father in 2011. &ldquo;Our father died five years ago, so our mother has been struggling to give us at least primary school education. But after primary, each of us has to find a way to survive,&rdquo; said Asenwa.Asenwa declared that he was in the early stages of making a career change. &ldquo;I have been working on other people&rsquo;s farms for a while now, but now that I have won this money, I will resign from my job,&rdquo; said an ecstatic Asenwa.&ldquo;I am going to open a small kiosk, so I can survive from day to day,&rdquo; he adds, as if still in disbelief that he has won. &ldquo;I also intend to buy a plot and build houses that I can rent out. I will also educate my siblings,&rdquo; he stated, adding that he will be employing his siblings in his kiosk when he gets it up and running.
