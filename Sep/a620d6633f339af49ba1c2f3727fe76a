Jubilee leaders yesterday accused Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho of interfering with Nairobi politics.Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, Nairobi woman representative Rachael Shebesh, nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi and nominated MPs Sonia Birdi and Johnson Sakaja said Joho &ldquo;must stop using money suspected to have come from suspicious business to influence Nairobi politics&rdquo;. They spoke during a rally in Mathare, Nairobi.Duale said President Uhuru Kenyatta has nothing to apologise for the remarks he made in Narok during the funeral of former Cabinet minister William ole Ntimama.&ldquo;Uhuru did not insult anyone. He said Kalonzo [Musyoka] and Raila [Odinga) will wait longer. But they [Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto] will continue building the SGR, improving health services and education,&rdquo; he said.Duale said Uhuru and Ruto won at the 2013 elections against the Cord leaders, despite having cases against them at the ICC. &ldquo;Now they don&rsquo;t have any burden. They will lock horns with them [Raila and Kalonzo],&rdquo; Duale said. &ldquo;Raila salivated in 1997, 2007, 2013 and will salivate again in 2017, even if they bring Joho to Nairobi.&rdquo;Elachi, who wants to run for the Dagoretti North MP seat, said Jubilee will &ldquo;clip&rdquo; Joho&rsquo;s wings. &ldquo;We want to tell you [Joho] that you will not influence Nairobi politics. We are coming to Mombasa to teach you a lesson, because you have no respect for the presidency,&rdquo; Elachi said.Nairobi governor hopeful Margaret Wanjiru said Governor Evans Kidero has sensed he will lose and is seeking Joho&rsquo;s help to gain support.&ldquo;Kidero, shame on you. You are a sitting governor and you can&rsquo;t mobilise supporters for a rally,&rdquo; Wanjiru said. &ldquo;ODM has no support in Nairobi. It ceased to have support in Nairobi the moment I quit it.&rdquo;They said they will support whoever will be picked by their supporters to run against Kidero.
