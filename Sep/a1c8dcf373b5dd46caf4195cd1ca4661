Chama Cha Uzalendo chairman Maur Bwanamaka has said the party will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s 2017 reelection but denied joining the Jubilee Party.&ldquo;The fact that we are affiliated to Jubilee does not mean we have folded. We are an independent party supporting Uhuru&rsquo;s bid because we are not fielding a presidential candidate,&rdquo; he said. The party signed a post-coalition agreement with Jubilee in 2013. Yesterday, Bwanamaka said it will soon call for its National Delegates Convention to officially declare its support for Uhuru.On September 10, at least 11 political parties merged to form JP in a ceremony attended by Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto. However, Bwanamaka said failure to have his party join JP was for fear of not having a free and fair nomination. &ldquo;We cant be agreeing to anything that Jubilee says or does, other than the position of President, we will sponsor candidates for other seats,&rdquo; he said.
