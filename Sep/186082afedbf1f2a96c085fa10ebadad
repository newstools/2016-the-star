Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula has been urged to drop his presidential bid and support ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi.Lugari MP Ayub Savula yesterday said Mudavadi is the most experienced politician from Western and is well placed to take on President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. The former UDF vice chairperson said Mudavadi understands public service and can manage the country and fight corruption.&ldquo;When you compare Musalia and Wetang&rsquo;ula, you see the senator has only served as a minister, while Musalia has served as a minister and Vice President,&rdquo; Savula said.He said Wetang&rsquo;ula does not have enough resources to campaign for President.&ldquo;Even if you compared the resources, you find that Wetang&rsquo;ula cannot stage a strong Presidential campaign. Mudavadi has the energy and resources and he has done it before in 2013,&rdquo; Savula said.&ldquo;We have done enough civic education and voter registration. We will be looking at more than 3.5 million votes from the region. Let us solidify our votes and put personal interests aside for the community and the country.&rdquo;Savula said most regions that gained from the government voted as a bloc because they had bargaining power at the national level.
