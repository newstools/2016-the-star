"Our &nbsp;Party rejects anger and tantrums that hide real issues as Kenyans continue to suffer from the current government," he said. Joho further called on the Jubilee government to&nbsp; show the projects done in the last four years across the country instead of dismissing the opposition's questions. "We will always remind Kenyans that the Jubilee government has failed to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;even half of &nbsp;its 2013 lofty pledges." Joho was reacting &nbsp;days after&nbsp;President Uhuru asked&nbsp;Cord leader Raila Odinga to "leave&nbsp;Jubilee alone"&nbsp;and fix his party ahead of 2017 elections. "Wachana na nyumba yangu ya Jubilee. Nyinyi mkitafuta sisi tumekalia. E ndeleeni kumeze mate sisi tukila nyama,"&nbsp; Uhuru said in Kiswahili.This loosely translates to: "Leave my Jubilee house alone. As you search we are on the seat.&nbsp;Continue salivating as we feast on meat."READ: [VIDEO] Get your house in order, let Jubilee feast on 'meat', Uhuru tells Raila
