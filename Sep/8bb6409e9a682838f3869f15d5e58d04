Cord should retain its coalition status and not merge into a one party, two ODM legislators have said. &ldquo;The current steady status of Cord is due to support it draws from its affiliate parties. It remains stronger in his coalition arrangement since parties within it are allowed to strengthen themselves,&rdquo; Suba MP John Mbadi (pictured) said yesterday.The ODM national chairman spoke to the Star on the phone. He said turning Cord into a single party will lead to its disintegration. &ldquo;Political parties need to grow as institutions. We don&rsquo;t want to see after every election year people come up with new political parties after they disagree on internal and basic issues,&rdquo; Mbadi said.On Monday, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka suggested Cord merge into one political party. But Kabondo Kasipul MP Sylvance Osele said, &ldquo;Cord is better off as a coalition bringing several houses into one homestead and therefore enriching the aspirations of different political outfits.&rdquo;
