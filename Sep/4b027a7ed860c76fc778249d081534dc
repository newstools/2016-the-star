Two Kwale MCAs &ndash; one for and the other against Governor Salim Mvurya &ndash; confronted each other on social media on Saturday.They disagreed over the formation of an ad hoc committee to investigate public officers campaigning before resigning. Mvurya&rsquo;s ally and Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama said there are more important issues that need to be addressed &ndash; including the passing of critical bills &ndash; other than investigating county workers. In a Facebook post he said, &ldquo;Wasting time drawing allowances for probing people amounts to insincerity and failure on our part.&rdquo; Mwereni MCA Kassim Pojjo took on Yama saying his statement was misleading because &ldquo;he was not in the house when the issue was raised.&rdquo;
