The appointment of a Moi University vice chancellor should be done on merit, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (pictured) has said. He said the list of applicants should be made public to end suspicions of an attempt to lock out qualified candidates.Murkomen urged Education CS Fred Matiang&rsquo;i to expedite the appointment of a substantive VC to end the wrangles. These led to Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos to storm the university on Tuesday. They demanded the appointment of &ldquo;one of our own&rdquo; as the VC to replace outgoing vice chancellor Richard Mibey.
