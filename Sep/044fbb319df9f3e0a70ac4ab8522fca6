They include James Waiganjo (Oljororok), Agostino Neto (Ndhiwa), Rachel Ameso (Kakamega woman rep), Christine Ombaka (Siaya woman rep) and Benjamin Andola (Khwisero).

We have members from Cord and Jubilee working together,&rdquo; Waiganjo said. He said their intention is to ensure Kenyans appreciate each other before, during and after the election. Waiganjo said Kenyans should respect the poll outcome.
