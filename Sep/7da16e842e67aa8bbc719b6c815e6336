Teachers this week expect a quicker ruling on an appeal case filed by Clarkson Insurance Brokers concerning the teachers&rsquo; medical cover tender to allow a flawless provision of medical care.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) said teachers should not suffer because of the tender wars. &ldquo;We expect a quicker decision and to get the winner of the tender to sign another contract for teachers,&rdquo; he said. Sossion said he believes the tender was done aboveboard.TSC has one week to sign the medical cover contract.The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority is expected to look into Clarkson&rsquo;s complaint of not having been evaluated after being knocked out on technical grounds. Clarkson quoted the lowest bid of Sh14.7 billion, but was not evaluated after its bid was &ldquo;found to be non-responsive, given that they did not meet a number of mandatory requirements&rdquo;.AON&rsquo;s quotation was Sh15.3 billion for Option 1 and Sh27.3 billion for Option 2, while Liaison quoted Sh16.5 billion for Option 1 and Sh53.8 billion for Option 2.The Star&rsquo;s investigations have established that Clarkson was supposed to provide a bid bond of Sh145 million, but only presented a Sh130 million bond.On the other hand, AoN was required to put up a bid bond of Sh153 million, but managed to present a total Sh280 million, divided as Sh180 million and an extra one of Sh100 million, &ldquo;well above the tender requirements&rdquo;.On September 8, TSC awarded the tender to AoN based on its first year quotation of Sh4.54 billion. Clarkson quoted Sh4.96 billion.TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said, &ldquo;The one-year tender is subject to renewal for the second and third year upon satisfactory performance and availability of the funds.&rdquo;
