ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s wife Ida has dismissed reports the party has a list of &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; candidates. She assured aspirants the primaries will be free and fair. Ida said the ODM leadership is focused on making the party more vibrant. She urged supporters to ignore cheap propaganda meant to tarnish the party&rsquo;s reputation and demoralise members.&ldquo;I have personally asked Jakom about the alleged list of preferred candidates and he assured me there is none,&rdquo; Ida said. She said as a mother of ODM supporters, she will not allow aspirants to toil during campaigns only to be subjected to unfair nominations. &ldquo;We must ensure all candidates have a level playing ground for the voters to elerct leaders of their choice,&rdquo; Ida said.
