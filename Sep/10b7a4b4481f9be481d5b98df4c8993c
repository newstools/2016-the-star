The National Assembly Education Committee chairperson Sabina Chege has called for the disbandment of the Moi University Council, citing recent riots against the acting vice chancellor. Some North Rift leaders rallied residents to demonstrate against the council&rsquo;s appointment of Laban Ayiro as acting VC, demanding that the results of the interviews be made public. Chege said the council should be held accountable for leaking information on Ayiro&rsquo;s appointment before it was made public, prompting the row. &ldquo;If a council conducts an interview, then how does that interview &ndash; which is supposed to be confidential &ndash; come to the public? Let us not divide this country,&rdquo; Chege said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you come from, we should give everybody a chance and embrace professionalism and actually separate politics from education. If we take the direction I have seen us taking, then our education will be in jeopardy. These are national institutions, not regional.&rdquo;
