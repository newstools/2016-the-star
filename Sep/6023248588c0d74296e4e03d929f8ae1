Dolamu Henry Oduwole died yesterday morning at the Nairobi Hospital, where he had been admitted after his blood pressure went down drastically.Wavinya&rsquo;s elder brother Raphael Musyoki said he died in the Intensive Care Unit at 1.30am. &ldquo;I was called by my sister at around 1am and she told me her husband&rsquo;s condition had deteriorated. He passed on as I arrived at the hospital,&rdquo; he told the Star on the phone.Musyoki said Oduwole has been sickly since March. &ldquo;He has been in and out of hospital. He has been to The Mater Hospital, Nairobi Hospital and even London, but this morning God decided he should rest,&rdquo; he said.Musyoki said Oduwole&rsquo;s death is a big blow to the Ndeti family, as he held a big place in their lives and in their hearts. &ldquo;He was not just an in-law but a son of the family.
