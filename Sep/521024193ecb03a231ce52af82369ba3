Nyeri Deputy Governor Samuel Wamathai has said he is academically qualified to hold office.He showed journalists a degree certificate in Air and Space Law from McGill University Graduate Law School and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Law, Economics and Statistics from the University of Nairobi.In a press conference in his office on Wednesday, Wamathai also had an advanced certificate in air transport management, economics and strategic planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The deputy governor said he has worked with the government for many years and nobody has ever questioned his integrity. He termed complaints over his academic qualifications mere politics and malicious.Wamathai said he has worked in the public service for more than 30 years because of his qualifications. He threatened to sue organisations that questioned his papers. &ldquo;That is why I was picked as deputy governor since I have the papers. I will still be the deputy governor if Governor Nderitu Gachagua will be reelected,&rdquo; he said.On September 13, a human rights group in Nyeri wrote to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, questioning Wamathai&rsquo;s academic qualification.Futa Magendo Action Network executive coordinator James Mugo petitioned the EACC to investigate the authenticity of Wamathai&rsquo;s papers and justification for using the title &lsquo;ambassador&rsquo;.&ldquo;We are writing this petition due to public anxiety. From the time Wamathai presented his academic documents to the IEBC, the public has raised a lot of doubt,&rdquo; the letter said.&ldquo;There is also need to demand from the Commission of Higher Education a report on the authenticity of the said academic documents.&rdquo;The human rights group raised doubt on Wamathai&rsquo;s Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Law, Economics and Statistics. It questioned whether such a course is offered at the University of Nairobi.
