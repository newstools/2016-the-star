Talented Kakamega youth lack opportunity to make use of their gifts, and the county government is to blame, Marama Central MCA aspirant Thomas Wanga has said. He said the government lacks programmes to identify, nurture and develop talent.&ldquo;Some youth are not good in class work but perform well in out-of-class activities. When we concentrate on academics, we are denying them an opportunity to prosper,&rdquo; Wanga said.He spoke on Saturday, when he launched the Maseno Cup tournament at Shitsitswi Primary School &ldquo;We are born with the propensity to achieve, succeed and thrive. We have skills, talents and abilities that can be nurtured, shaped, formed and encouraged to enable us reach the pinnacle perfection. This is what youth in Kakamega county are missing,&rdquo; Wanga said. He said his aim is to give youth talented in sports exposure and an opportunity to market their skills. Wanga said four young people from Butere who participated in the Maseno Cup two years ago were hired by the Kenafric Company in Nairobi. &ldquo;If provided with role models and robust, superlative tutoring and instruction, the youth can get employment, excel in life and make new friends g,&rdquo; Wanga said. He said corruption is threatening the growth of sports talent. &ldquo;A lot of money allocated to sports ends up in individuals&rsquo; pockets,&rdquo; he said. But area MCA Michael Keya said the county administration has programmes for sports and music and hires youth. &rdquo;Our music team is the best in the country after it emerged the champion during the Inter-County Music Festival in Kisumu last November. The governor&rsquo;s soccer cup is ongoing in all the subcounties,&rdquo; he said.
