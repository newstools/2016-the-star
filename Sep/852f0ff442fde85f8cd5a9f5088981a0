Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has condemned the public spat between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga at the funeral of late former minister William Ntimama on Wednesday.In a statement issued yesterday, he termed as despicable the altercation between Uhuru and Raila on who owned Ntimama politically.&ldquo;Every leader must exercise restraint. There was no need for the juvenile exchange at such a solemn occasion. I was both ashamed and embarrassed these are the people Kenyans vote for,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.&ldquo;Why would you want to claim closeness? Only the dead can be witness,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi took a swipe at the Jubilee administration, saying corruption and mockery are its watermark. He said Kenyans are impatient with its trickery.&ldquo;It was horrible to hear the President own up to corruption and chide those who aren&rsquo;t partaking of it. The &lsquo;sisi tunakula nyama na nyinyi harurufu&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t just in bad taste,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The president was justifying the &lsquo;it&rsquo;s our time to eat&rsquo;, a crude reminder of what Mzee Jomo Kenyatta told Bildad Kaggia. Uhuru&rsquo;s was an invitation for all of us to join thieving as a national pastime.&rdquo;Mudavadi said Jubilee plots to sabotage IEBC reform and is deceiving Kenyans. &ldquo;The delay in signing the IEBC bills is part of Jubilee&rsquo;s belief that success in governance is through treachery.The sooner Kenyans realise this, the easier it will be to trim its excesses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is evident the whole exercise was designed to fail. Jubilee is bent on scuttling IEBC reforms.
