Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire nearly came to blows on Sunday during a fundraiser at Karurumo market.The clash between the two threw the meeting into disarray after their supporters engaged in a shouting match over who should be the county's next governor.The legislators scrambled for a microphone and shouted at each other as they sought to address their charged supporters."Sisty for governor! Sisty for governor ! Sisty for governor!" Mbarire's supporters shouted, while Kivuti&rsquo;s supporters shouted back: "Kivuti for governor! Kivuti for governor!"The confrontation went on for about forty minutes prompting the two combatants to leave without giving out their donations.The police had a difficult time trying to separate the two groups of supporters, some of them had started exchanging blows."I cannot allow you to come to my constituency to ridicule me by launching your governor ambitions here. Couldn&rsquo;t you do it at your place? You cannot shake me, this is my home ground," Mbarire was heard shouting.Read: Mbarire, Kiragu woo Embu voters for county top jobKivuti who clutched&nbsp;the microphone also shouted back telling her that he had a right to be everywhere since he was the county&rsquo;s senator.The fundraiser was organised for a group of musicians who wanted the leaders to help them purchase instruments.Governor Martin Wambora, Kivuti, Mbarire,&nbsp; governor aspirant Kithinji Kiragu among others had been invited. &nbsp;Read: I will run for governor because Wambora has failed &ndash; MbarireKiragu had arrived earlier, addressed the crowd peacefully, gave his donation and left before the two came. Trouble started after supporters of the two leaders, who have been great friends but of late turned foes,&nbsp; taunted each other over the governor race.In her speech, Mbarire accused Kivuti of violating an unwritten MoU which reportedly stated that the governor seat should go to the Embu community and a Mbeere to be fronted as senator.However, when Kivuti stood to speak, he told Mbarire that the community has made its decision that he vies for governor."The county has decided on the matter and thus we should continue," said Kivuti.It was at this point that Mbarire supporters started jeering, shouting and heckling Kivuti, prompting the senator's supporters to engage them.Kivuti asked the Runyenjes MP to take her donation to him but when Mbarire tried to get the microphone, the senator held it tightly.It was then that she grabbed it and a scuffle ensued before Kivuti gave up and left.&nbsp;
