GG is sitting in a secluded corner, a glass of half drunk scotch in his hand. I say hello and slide into the seat opposite him.&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;I am, just a little tired,&rdquo; I respond. A waitress materialises to take my order. &ldquo;A glass of chardonnay,&rdquo; I say, hoping the house wine is rich and full-bodied. &ldquo;Anything to eat?&rdquo; she asks. I shake my head as she heads off for the wine.&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; GG says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pregnant.&rdquo; I nod, wondering if he&rsquo;s the one that will demand a pregnancy test. The VIP didn&rsquo;t seem to doubt me and neither did Mr N. &ldquo;That is unfortunate,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But these things happen.&rdquo; The waitress returns and places a glass on a napkin in front of me. She presents me with a bottle placed over her arm for me to read the label. &ldquo;The house chardonnay that we serve by the glass is finished, but perhaps you&rsquo;d like to order a bottle of Mirassou Chardonnay? It&rsquo;s excellent.&rdquo; I look towards GG. He shrugs. A bottle of wine means I have to stay here for much longer than I had anticipated. As though reading my mind, he says: &ldquo;You can always carry it with you.&rdquo;I nod at the waitress and she quickly and expertly uncorks it, pouring a little into my glass to taste. I immediately taste the peach notes. The secondary flavours are melon, citrus and vanilla notes. I love it. I indicate to her to fill the glass.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return with an ice bucket,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This is a lovely place. I&rsquo;ve never been here,&rdquo; I say. GG doesn&rsquo;t feel like small talk. He passes me an envelope, there&rsquo;s cash inside. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sh50,000. More than enough to take care of the problem,&rdquo; he says. I take the envelope and place it in my bag. I then take a big gulp of wine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure you quite understand what&rsquo;s going on here,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Explain it to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&hellip;.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m interrupted by the arrival of the ice bucket. She places the wine inside it and covers it with a table napkin. &ldquo;Another drink, sir?&rdquo; GG nods as he swigs the last of his drink. She saunters away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think 50k is going to be enough,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need more. A lot more.&rdquo; He narrows his eyes and I can see a slight tick and what may be an angry glint. &ldquo;Is this some sort of shakedown?&rdquo; he asks.The waitress is back with his drink. She places it down with a flourish and then makes a show of topping up my wine. We sit there, patiently waiting for her to make herself scarce. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what this is,&rdquo; I respond. &ldquo;I want two million or I keep the baby.&rdquo; He laughs. &ldquo;Two million? Keep it. Don&rsquo;t keep it. What do I care?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Your wife may have a thing or two to say about it,&rdquo; I respond. &ldquo;Samantha,&rdquo; he says, still laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pretend that we did not have this conversation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pay the bill,&rdquo; he continues as he picks up his phone and car keys from the table. &ldquo;You can afford it.&rdquo; He stands up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real genius, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he responds, the sarcasm dripping as slowly as the droplets from my chardonnay. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you think you know about me, but I&rsquo;m not the guy you try and blackmail.&rdquo; With that, he turns and leaves. Just like that. No goodbyes, nothing. Elvis has left the building. I sit there, slightly embarrassed. Well, at least he had given me the 50k! I polish off my glass of wine. What do I do now? Call his bluff?
