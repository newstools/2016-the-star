Saboti MP David Wafula has asked his opponents to be ready for a tough battle next year. He said he has strategies, which include organising two fundraisers per ward every month, to defeat rivals. &ldquo;I want to ensure they attend the fundraisers that I hold to make sure they are broke as the election draws near. Don&rsquo;t think Wafula is a fool&rdquo; he said.
