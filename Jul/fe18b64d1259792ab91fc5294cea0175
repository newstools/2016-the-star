We must guard our mouths and respect each other to ensure we don&rsquo;t taint the community&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; he said.Otondi urged Luo Nyanza politicians to remain united and focus on improving the people&rsquo;s living standards. &ldquo;I hope our people will judge you on the basis of development, not the way one engaged the other in public spats,&rdquo; he said.Magwanga warned politicians against meddling in the council&rsquo;s affairs. He said they recognise Otondi as the bona fide elders&rsquo; chairman and those he crowns as county leaders.&ldquo;Mbaka has been given the mantle so we don&rsquo;t expect some politicians to organise the installation of a different elder for Homa Bay. We know Otondi as the bona fide chairman because Raila also recognises him,&rdquo; he said.(+) New chairman pledges to unite the communityMbaka pledged to unite the community.&ldquo;I understand the challenges we undergo as a community, but through consultations, I will ensure we walk together,&rdquo; he said.
