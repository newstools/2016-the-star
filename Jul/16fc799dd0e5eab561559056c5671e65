Garissa Council of Elders chairman Dubat Amey has resigned, saying he was frustrated by Governor Nathif Jama. Speaking to the press in Garissa town on Saturday, he said since his appointment to the 15 executive-member council on March 30 last year, the elders have never met or heard from the governor. &ldquo;We were to work closely with the county administration to engage other 50 members in peace-building.The governor was to lead, but from all indications, he has not shown any willingness,&rdquo; Amey said. He said the governor has sidelined them and is working with a &ldquo;clique&rdquo; from his community.&ldquo;The governor has instead picked a few elders from his community to drive his political agenda. We are not party to any decisions they make, because they don&rsquo;t represent the interests of residents,&rdquo; Amey said. Yesterday, Governor Jama termed the allegations &ldquo;unfounded&rdquo;. He said he has been working closely with the elders to unite residents. &ldquo;If the chair had issues, he would have called or asked to meet me ,&rdquo; Jama said. The governor said he will soon meet with the elders to solve outstanding issues.
