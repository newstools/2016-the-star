Raila Odinga&rsquo;s ODM party has accused Musalia Mudavadi&rsquo;s Amani of defacing ODM&rsquo;s Sabatia office that was to be officially opened next Friday.Raila was to preside over its opening on Mudavadi&rsquo;s home turf and receive at least 300 defectors from Amani. This did not go down well with Mudavadi&rsquo;s supporters.But Vihiga county Amani secretary William Kaisha on Wednesday denied claims their supporters disfigured the office.&ldquo;Concerning the planned defection of our 300 members to ODM, we want to let you know we have registered 50,000 members in Sabatia constituency alone, so their exit is not a threat to us,&rdquo; Kaisha said.ODM director of political affairs Opiyo Wandayi and Vihiga nominated MCA Ben Ombima said Amani was &ldquo;threatened by the warm reception Raila got in Mbale a fortnight ago&rdquo;.On June 18, Raila was welcomed to Vihiga. An enthusiastic crowd that had jammed the Kisumu-Kakamega road with placards urged Cord leader to address them on his way to the Kakamega governor&rsquo;s office.Residents asked him to work with Mudavadi, and one placard bore the words: &ldquo;Raila for President. Musalia for Prime Minister&rdquo;. On Wednesday, Wandayi, the Ugunja MP, said the ODM office was defaced to undermine ODM&rsquo;s popularity. &ldquo;It is barbaric, undemocratic, retrogressive and amateurish,&rdquo; he said.
