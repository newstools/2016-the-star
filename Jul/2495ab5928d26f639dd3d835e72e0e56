Israel will provide intelligence services to help Kenya combat terrorism, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. Netanyahu said the cooperation is aimed at prosperity and security and his country faces challenges similar to Kenya's. He added that Israel&nbsp;was happy to partner with Africa&nbsp; " because we believe you have the same potential".&nbsp; "Terrorists see us as one enemy and we must remain united to fight the enemy," he said. "If you know well in advance that an attack is going to happen you can prevent loss of life." Uhuru said Kenya will benefit in terms of training, equipment, technology and strategic intelligence. "We cannot live in the past," he said and noted that challenges must be addressed for progress to be made. Netanyahu's&nbsp; assurance follows several attacks by al Shabaab militants on security personnel and members of the public. Six people were killed when suspected al Shabaab militants sprayed two buses with bullets on Friday morning. In an attack in June, five police officers were killed when the terrorists attacked their vehicle using a rocket-propelled grenade.
