The political contest ahead of the general election seems to be dynamic and unpredictable as to who may take the lead in the governor and senator seats. After the announcement by Senator Kiraitu Murungi two weeks ago that he will vie for the governor’s seat, incumbent Peter Munya has embarked on a verbal offensive attack on Kiraitu. The contest between Kiraitu and Munya is hanging on volatile ground, where each of them is pegging on their political subtribes for backup. Speaking to the public at Mwerongundu in Igembe, Munya said according to the Meru culture, the Guantai age set, which he belongs to, has always cleared the mess created by Kiraitu’s age set, which is Lubetaa. “Now it’s our time to work and his time to retire,” Munya told Kiraitu. The Meru senator has teamed up with Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi to be the senate aspirant. Linturi commands a big following in the Igembe community and may not disappoint in the long run. It may be seen as a two-horse race in Meru but other coalitions are being formed. The presidential adviser on education, Kilemi Mwiria, who emerged second in the last general election in the governor race, has teamed up with lawyer Mugambi Imanyara, who will be vying for the Senate seat, and Elizabeth Kailemia, who emerged second in the woman representative race, to try her luck again.
