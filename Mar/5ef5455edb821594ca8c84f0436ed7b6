Deputy President William Ruto’s allies clashed publicly in Eldoret town on Sunday over allegations some are backing Kanu in the Kericho by-election. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said he will not change his decision to support Kanu because it does not mean he has quit Jubilee. Sudi clashed with Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Melly and former MPs David Koros and Joseph Lagat. They spoke at St Michael Catholic Church in Kesses, Uasin Gishu. Sudi addressed the meeting and left in a huff. Melly said: “If there are people who have benefited from Jubilee, it is you Sudi and Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter. We will not let you to confuse our people with your petty politics.” He said a month ago, Ruto visited Sudi’s home to open his new house and it is surprising he is now supporting Kanu. Melly said Sudi and Keter are being used to undermine the DP and Jubilee in the region, “but the plan will flop”. Melly’s sentiments were echoed by Lagat and Koros. Sudi said Ruto is the undisputed leader of Rift Valley, but residents have the right to receive services from the government. “We must accept to correct each other within Jubilee. I have said Jubilee must implement what we want before next year’s polls and we will not change our position on that,” he said. Sudi said the Jubilee government has failed to address problems affecting maize, dairy and tea farmers. “We cannot be people used to saying yes, yes, all the time,” he said. “We will not tolerate threats because of what we have said. Let us not be told we have to toe the line. There is no line apart from what our people want. We cannot be people used to saying yes, yes all the time,” he said. Sudi said voters will decide the fate of all MPs next year, and it will be based on performance.
