Many celebrities have had their own way of protecting their child's
privacy especially from the social media's prying eyes. At some point its a
good thing because many want their lives as private as possible. It
gets to a point the public forgets that their kids even exist. But its
none of our business. Citizen TV anchor Janet Mbugua is one of the
many celebrities who live a private life with her husband and their
adorable baby Ethan Ndichu. The cutie was first introduced to the world
in October last year and everyone was super excited for the Ndichu's. Janet
and her husband have changed since the birth of their baby and have
become loving parents to the youngin. They have kept their baby away
from the public eye, only giving tiny details of the baby like his tiny
legs. Janet recently gave her fans a close peek at Ethanâ€™s face in a photo she shared on Instagram but his face is not clearly seen. This cute bundle of joy must have picked the best features from both his parents. We cannot wait to see him up close and candid.
